Check out your error logs, they are mysql.err and <hostname>.err in the 
data directory of your MySQL installation.

You should first check your error log
You get there by going to the control panel
and click administrative tasks
and the event viewer

I think you should search 
the MSDN website for that 
error number

Hopefully it will give you a line 
on what's happening by telling you 
the sorts of things that can cause it.

It is necessary that the MySQL process 
have the correct privileges for the

Did you check you phpinfo results to make 
certain you are reading the correct php.ini file?

Naturally you checked c:\php\extensions that the php_gd2.dll file was 
there and the web server has permissions to read it.  But, I don't really 
think this is the problem because you'd be seeing error messages saying 
that the file/functions/etc could not be found.

What does the "Configuration File (php.ini) Path" in the phpinfo output 
say?  Does it match the php.ini file you just edited?

Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself 
rather than in the system32 dir.

Following is from php_info():

Virtual Directory Support: enabled 
Configuration File (php.ini) Path at C:\WINNT 

This is where I placed the php.ini.  Someone said to copy all .dll and files
under extensions to c:\winnt\sys32 also, which I did.  Was that an idiotic
move?  (Ok, you really do not have to answer that!)

Once again, your patience (as I am a confirmed rookie) and advice is deeply

Daniel C.
advised you:
"Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself 
rather than in the system32 dir."

Find the diretory where the php.exe file is
(most likely its C:\php)

and move the php.ini (which you edited) from \winnt\system32
to there.

Give it another shot.

Good luck...

And what happens if you change some other setting in the ini file?  Do the 
changes get reflected in the phpinfo output?  For exmaple, change 
display_errors and see what happens.

Well, that's the "official" way to do it, but I think that it's idiotic.  
Just put the PHP directory and the php\dll directory in the system's PATH 
and you're good to go!

I'm looking into using an Model View Controller framework to use as a base
to launch from in developing future projects in an efficient manner, and I'd
like some feedback from anyone who's used one. So I guess this question
splits into 2 threads.

First, what are the pro's and cons to using an established MVC framework in
general, as opposed to using other strategies to split up logic from
presentation? Smarty templates anyone?

Second, what frameworks have you used that you like / dislike? I'm currently
looking into Seagull, after having played with rolling my own for a bit.
Fusebox makes me itchy after briefly looking at the demos and files (the
potentially huge 'controller', and as irrational as it is, the heavy
reliance on passing 'action' variables in the url). I'm mostly looking for
speed, ease of development and deployment, and security.

Thoughts?

I'm using Smarty templates now for "my first big project," which is an
database that was basically ported to php/mysql from ms access.  We extend
Smarty with a custom class that runs a few extra things (checks permissions
for different templates and different data processing actions based on
login, etc.) and then uses Smarty to parse the templates.  It's great and
very flexible and allows my brain to keep thinking in terms of "data entry
form, module, etc." as I did with MS Access.

However I feel I honestly have not been able to do as good a job with
"splitting up logic from presentation" as I'd like to.  It's a judgement
call and a thread that comes up here and there on the Smarty forums: how
much do you have to / want to keep them separated?    Since I'm the only
developer on this team, I have, of course, both a lot of flexibility and a
lot of chances to write lazy code.

All in all, though, Smarty and our little extension of it, are serving me
well, and I think I probably am limited more by my own lack of programming
experience/discipline than by the framework itself.

I have done the following:
1. Moved php.ini from C:\WINNT\system32 to C:\php  (this is where php.exe is
and other directories for php)
2. modified extension_dir=C:\php  in php.ini
3. stopped and restarted apache, and pointed to php_info()
4. Verified that there is no php.ini in the C:\WINNT\system32

CURIOUS:
The following still show and I have tried to find where and why it is
pointing to these directories to no avail (sigh)
Following is after the changes as above were made:
Configuration File (php.ini) Path  C:\WINNT <<< I moved it here
c:\php\php.ini
include_path .;c:\php4\pear .;c:\php4\pear <<<I do NOT have this dir nor I
pointed to it
extension_dir c:\php4 c:\php4   <<<< I do not have a c:\php4 and I went thru
my php.ini I don't see it.

Thank you in advance, for your time. I do know that it is something very
basic and stupid that I am doing!

Check out your error logs, they are mysql.err and <hostname>.err in the 
data directory of your MySQL installation.

You should first check your error log
You get there by going to the control panel
and click administrative tasks
and the event viewer

Um -- the real name of the

these are the operating system

I think you should search 
the MSDN website for that 
error number

Hopefully it will give you a line 
on what's happening by telling you 
the sorts of things that can cause it.

It is necessary that the MySQL process 
have the correct privileges for the

Did you check you phpinfo results to make 
certain you are reading the correct php.ini file?

Naturally you checked c:\php\extensions that the php_gd2.dll file was 
there and the web server has permissions to read it.  But, I don't really 
think this is the problem because you'd be seeing error messages saying 
that the file/functions/etc could not be found.

What does the "Configuration File (php.ini) Path" in the phpinfo output 
say?  Does it match the php.ini file you just edited?

Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself 
rather than in the system32 dir.

Following is from php_info():

Virtual Directory Support: enabled 
Configuration File (php.ini) Path at C:\WINNT 

This is where I placed the php.ini.  Someone said to copy all .dll and files
under extensions to c:\winnt\sys32 also, which I did.  Was that an idiotic
move?  (Ok, you really do not have to answer that!)

Once again, your patience (as I am a confirmed rookie) and advice is deeply

Daniel C.
advised you:
"Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself 
rather than in the system32 dir."

Find the diretory where the php.exe file is
(most likely its C:\php)

and move the php.ini (which you edited) from \winnt\system32
to there.

Give it another shot.

Good luck...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MVC Framework opinions
In-Reply-To: <00dc01c3ffe1$ba13cc50$6e01a8c0@iifwp.local>

Message-ID: <4043C781.5060303@next-online.net>

I've used a couple different implementations of MVC. 

You have to define what you mean by MVC as it looks to me as if almost 
everyone implementing MVC pushes the definition(s) in new and 
interesting way. 

I've seen MVC implemented different ways.  For example I've seen:

where you've got a php page which is just a hollow shell that includes 
the worker file;
    index.php and indexWorker.php,
    listing.php and listingWorker.php, etc.

where you've got a single php page which based on the use of the site 
loads/includes different worker files:
    index.php and Worker.php, Listing.php, etc.

where you've got a single php page, a logic page and a template:
    index.php and indexWorder.php and index.tpl

Then I've seen it taken to extremes, where every field in a table has 
four different controllers, add, edit, delete and view.  So to do a 
query you'd do something like $a = getTableField('tablename', 
'fieldname');   ,  and getTableField would connect to the database an 
query the database for that specific piece of data.  Personally I think 
this is silly.  Makes maintain the code brutally difficult.  I'd rather 
write SQL.  Mind you I know how to write SQL.

For me the answer is to not use a formal framework design.  Pick a 
design that works for your level of competency and the particulars of 
the application.  If a version of MVC makes it easier for you to 
abstract the logic of the application then use MVC.  If you are 
abstracting the logic of the application you may find that there is 
another logical framework design/topology that works better.  Make your 
code easy to maintain.   MVC may or may not make your code easier to 
maintain.  As far as I can tell there's nothing inherent in MVC that 
would make code easier to maintain.  It's just as easy to write bad code 
with MVC as it is without MVC.

Hope this is helpful.
Chris

I have done the following:
1. Moved php.ini from C:\WINNT\system32 to C:\php  (this is where php.exe is
and other directories for php)
2. modified extension_dir=C:\php  in php.ini
3. stopped and restarted apache, and pointed to php_info()
4. Verified that there is no php.ini in the C:\WINNT\system32

CURIOUS:
The following still show and I have tried to find where and why it is
pointing to these directories to no avail (sigh)
Following is after the changes as above were made:
Configuration File (php.ini) Path  C:\WINNT <<< I moved it here
c:\php\php.ini
include_path .;c:\php4\pear .;c:\php4\pear <<<I do NOT have this dir nor I
pointed to it
extension_dir c:\php4 c:\php4   <<<< I do not have a c:\php4 and I went thru
my php.ini I don't see it.

Thank you in advance, for your time. I do know that it is something very
basic and stupid that I am doing!

And what happens if you change some other setting in the ini file?  Do the 
changes get reflected in the phpinfo output?  For exmaple, change 
display_errors and see what happens.

Well, that's the "official" way to do it, but I think that it's idiotic.  
Just put the PHP directory and the php\dll directory in the system's PATH 
and you're good to go!

I'm looking into using an Model View Controller framework to use as a base
to launch from in developing future projects in an efficient manner, and I'd
like some feedback from anyone who's used one. So I guess this question
splits into 2 threads.

First, what are the pro's and cons to using an established MVC framework in
general, as opposed to using other strategies to split up logic from
presentation? Smarty templates anyone?

Second, what frameworks have you used that you like / dislike? I'm currently
looking into Seagull, after having played with rolling my own for a bit.
Fusebox makes me itchy after briefly looking at the demos and files (the
potentially huge 'controller', and as irrational as it is, the heavy
reliance on passing 'action' variables in the url). I'm mostly looking for
speed, ease of development and deployment, and security.

Thoughts?

I'm using Smarty templates now for "my first big project," which is an
database that was basically ported to php/mysql from ms access.  We extend
Smarty with a custom class that runs a few extra things (checks permissions
for different templates and different data processing actions based on
login, etc.) and then uses Smarty to parse the templates.  It's great and
very flexible and allows my brain to keep thinking in terms of "data entry
form, module, etc." as I did with MS Access.

However I feel I honestly have not been able to do as good a job with
"splitting up logic from presentation" as I'd like to.  It's a judgement
call and a thread that comes up here and there on the Smarty forums: how
much do you have to / want to keep them separated?    Since I'm the only
developer on this team, I have, of course, both a lot of flexibility and a
lot of chances to write lazy code.

All in all, though, Smarty and our little extension of it, are serving me
well, and I think I probably am limited more by my own lack of programming
experience/discipline than by the framework itself.

I have done the following:
1. Moved php.ini from C:\WINNT\system32 to C:\php  (this is where php.exe is
and other directories for php)
2. modified extension_dir=C:\php  in php.ini
3. stopped and restarted apache, and pointed to php_info()
4. Verified that there is no php.ini in the C:\WINNT\system32

CURIOUS:
The following still show and I have tried to find where and why it is
pointing to these directories to no avail (sigh)
Following is after the changes as above were made:
Configuration File (php.ini) Path  C:\WINNT <<< I moved it here
c:\php\php.ini
include_path .;c:\php4\pear .;c:\php4\pear <<<I do NOT have this dir nor I
pointed to it
extension_dir c:\php4 c:\php4   <<<< I do not have a c:\php4 and I went thru
my php.ini I don't see it.

Thank you in advance, for your time. I do know that it is something very
basic and stupid that I am doing!

Check out your error logs, they are mysql.err and <hostname>.err in the 
data directory of your MySQL installation.

You should first check your error log
You get there by going to the control panel
and click administrative tasks
and the event viewer

I think you should search 
the MSDN website for that 
error number

Hopefully it will give you a line 
on what's happening by telling you 
the sorts of things that can cause it.

I am trying to use jpgrap with php.  For that I need gd enabled.  Following

Did you check you phpinfo results to make 
certain you are reading the correct php.ini file?

Naturally you checked c:\php\extensions that the php_gd2.dll file was 
there and the web server has permissions to read it.  But, I don't really 
think this is the problem because you'd be seeing error messages saying 
that the file/functions/etc could not be found.

What does the "Configuration File (php.ini) Path" in the phpinfo output 
say?  Does it match the php.ini file you just edited?

Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself 
rather than in the system32 dir.

Following is from php_info():

Virtual Directory Support: enabled 
Configuration File (php.ini) Path at C:\WINNT 

This is where I placed the php.ini.  Someone said to copy all .dll and files
under extensions to c:\winnt\sys32 also, which I did.  Was that an idiotic
move?  (Ok, you really do not have to answer that!)

Once again, your patience (as I am a confirmed rookie) and advice is deeply

Daniel C.
advised you:
"Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself 
rather than in the system32 dir."

Find the diretory where the php.exe file is
(most likely its C:\php)

and move the php.ini (which you edited) from \winnt\system32
to there.

Give it another shot.

Good luck...

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] MVC Framework opinions
To: NYPHP Talk <talk at lists.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <4043C781.5060303 at next-online.net>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

I've used a couple different implementations of MVC. 

You have to define what you mean by MVC as it looks to me as if almost 
everyone implementing MVC pushes the definition(s) in new and 
interesting way. 

I've seen MVC implemented different ways.  For example I've seen:

where you've got a php page which is just a hollow shell that includes 
the worker file;
    index.php and indexWorker.php,
    listing.php and listingWorker.php, etc.

where you've got a single php page which based on the use of the site 
loads/includes different worker files:
    index.php and Worker.php, Listing.php, etc.

where you've got a single php page, a logic page and a template:
    index.php and indexWorder.php and index.tpl

Then I've seen it taken to extremes, where every field in a table has 
four different controllers, add, edit, delete and view.  So to do a 
query you'd do something like $a = getTableField('tablename', 
'fieldname');   ,  and getTableField would connect to the database an 
query the database for that specific piece of data.  Personally I think 
this is silly.  Makes maintain the code brutally difficult.  I'd rather 
write SQL.  Mind you I know how to write SQL.

For me the answer is to not use a formal framework design.  Pick a 
design that works for your level of competency and the particulars of 
the application.  If a version of MVC makes it easier for you to 
abstract the logic of the application then use MVC.  If you are 
abstracting the logic of the application you may find that there is 
another logical framework design/topology that works better.  Make your 
code easy to maintain.   MVC may or may not make your code easier to 
maintain.  As far as I can tell there's nothing inherent in MVC that 
would make code easier to maintain.  It's just as easy to write bad code 
with MVC as it is without MVC.

Hope this is helpful.
Chris

extensions doesn't need to be.  c:\php\dlls does though.  Oh, and make

Also, all those PHP dll files the install instructions told you to move to 
system32 should be moved back to the appropriate PHP directories.

Rafi:

You're all mixed up.  Start from a clean slate.  Delete the entire
contents of your c:\php directory all of your dll's.  To make sure you get
all the dll's out, do a file find on your entire c drive for "php*.dll"

Download a "Win32 Package" "Stable (4.3.x-dev)" snapshot from 
http://snaps.php.net/

Unzip it into c:\php

Move into that directory and copy php.ini-recommended to become php.ini

Now, if you want to be forward thinking, to prepare yourself for a simple
transition to PHP 5, rename php.exe to php-cgi.exe and copy
c:\php\cli\php.exe to c:\php.  Then adjust your Apache httpd.conf
accordingly.

Put c:\php and c:\php\dlls into your PATH environment variable.

Restart.

Now edit the php.ini file to be the way you want it, including setting the 
extensions path to c:\php\extensions and uncommenting the gd dll.

Oh, and how come your message included the entire 500+ lines of the digest
you were replying to?

Well, it's not solved, but as an interim measure to get it to work for 
now, I gave Apache the rights to create files in the winnt direcotry.  
Sub-optimal, that's for sure.

Haven't had the time to discuss it with the developers.

Message-ID: <29360848-6C61-11D8-8AE6-000502F1DDFC@click3x.com>

Good morning people,

Just a quick question, for which I'd like a quick answer.

When I wrote (uh... copy/pasted) my script to upload a file, I included 
the usual safeguards they mention in all the books: check to see if 
something is uploaded, verify file size != 0 and verify file type. Now, 
let's say I want to be able to upload 5 files at a time, must I verify 
every possible combination of uploaded/not-uploaded file or is there a 
function out there that was made specifically to handle this? (if there 
isn't I'll just bite the bullet and do it, I'm just thinking that this 
is so common someone MUSt have done it before, right?) IF I don't make 
sense, this is what I mean:

< example with only 1 file upload at a time>:
if ($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']=="") {
	echo "no file uploaded";
	exit;
}
if ($_FILES['userfile']['size']=="0") {
	echo "file size is 0";
	exit;
}

< example with only 2 files upload at a time>:
if ($_FILES['userfile_1']['tmp_name']=="" && 
$_FILES['userfile_2']['tmp_name']=="") {
	echo "no file uploaded";
	exit;
}
if ( ($_FILES['userfile_1']['size']=="0" && 
$_FILES['userfile_1']['tmp_name']!="" ) || 
($_FILES['userfile_2']['size']=="0" && 
$_FILES['userfile_2']['tmp_name']!="" )) {
	echo "file size is 0";
	exit;
}


If you have the possibility to upload 5 files at the same time, looks 
like things can get pretty hairy. Is it just stupid to allow users to 
upload multiple files at the same time? Just some quick thoughts 
please.

Grazie,
Greg

Try using a foreach loop over the $_FILES array:

foreach($_FILES as $file) {
  if ($file['size'] == 0 || $file['tmp_name'] != "") {
    echo "file size is 0";
    exit;
  }
}

I just dealt with this problem in the wee hours of last night - have a 
website that lets the client upload their entire database through one 
zipfile, as the six separate files were huge and it just seemed messy 
that way :)

With PEAR's HTML_QuickForm, you could create the entire shebang with the 
following code (apologies if I am being too verbose):

<?php
require_once 'HTML/QuickForm.php';
$form = new HTML_QuickForm('firstForm');

// create the form and it's required elements
$file =& $form->addElement('file', 'myfile1', 'Your datafile:');
$file =& $form->addElement('file', 'myfile2', 'Another datafile:');
$file =& $form->addElement('file', 'myfile3', 'And another:');
$file =& $form->addElement('file', 'myfile4', 'And another:');
$file =& $form->addElement('file', 'myfile5', 'And another:');
$form->addElement('submit', null, 'Send');
// this is the rule that makes them submit the file
$form->addRule('myfile', 'Required', 'uploadedfile', NULL, 'client');
$form->addRule('myfile', 'Required', 'uploadedfile', NULL, 'client');
$form->addRule('myfile', 'Required', 'uploadedfile', NULL, 'client');
$form->addRule('myfile', 'Required', 'uploadedfile', NULL, 'client');
$form->addRule('myfile', 'Required', 'uploadedfile', NULL, 'client');

// validate the form
if ($form->validate()) {
   /*
     form was validated, you got your files and can
     manipulate them just like normally-submitted files
   */
   print_r($_FILES['myfile1'];
   print_r($_FILES['myfile2'];
   print_r($_FILES['myfile3'];
   print_r($_FILES['myfile4'];
   print_r($_FILES['myfile5'];
} else {
   // nothing submitted, give them the form
   $form->display();
}

?>

The documentation for HTML_QuickForm is excellent, and inclues a 
QuickStart and an external link to a more detailed tutorial:

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.html.html-quickform.php

I'd also like to mention that I just finished a review of "PHP 
Anthology, Volume I, Foundations" by Harry Fuecks (SitePoint) that 
tackles your problem with standard PHP coding style and using PEAR. 
Very comprehensive and useful.

Whups, forgot to correct the names of the elements to 'file1', 'file2', etc.

Also note that HTML_QuickForm can enforce mimetype checks, size 
constraints...  Take a look at the documentation for examples.

I'd rewrite that as
<?
   for ($a =0; $a < 100000;$a++)
	echo "Best wishes, Dan!!! <br>";
?>

Meaning the same in much cleaner code.

Cheers and good luck to Dan,

Sorry to do this, but I have the urge:

<?
    for ($a = 0; $a < 1;)
 	echo "Best wishes, Dan!!! <br>";
?>

Isn't PHP overkill for a simple task like this?

    #!/bin/bash
    yes 'Best wishes, Dan!!! <br>'

Less overhead! ;-)

Dude -- Just because Dan's forking a child process, doesn't mean we
have to.  How about:

#!/usr/bin/yes Best Wishes, Dan!!! <br>

There's your 40 byte script solution.  :-)

Message-ID: <20040303014251.GB5058@ncc.edu>

Have any of you had to display local time on a server that uses GMT?
I'm searching around Google trying to figure out how best to calculate
NY time.  I don't want to just subtract 6 from the hour, because then
I'd have to manually change the code twice a year.

It seems that the setlocale method *might* work, but I can't figure
out what to send it.  Calling it as:

setlocale( LC_TIME, "EST" );

doesn't seem to do the trick.  Help?

TIA,

Hi there:

I've designed a bajillion database-driven Web projects in the past, 
but I've got a client requesting something that is entirely 
reasonable (conceptually), but a logistical nightmare.

Generally, I try not to store any HTML in a database, no matter what. 
Further, in this situation, the content editor needs a setup where 
they do zero coding, and can have the following features:

-- basic formatting, including bold, italic, underline...basically, a 
few styles that would be pre-defined and available to them

-- inline articles (not much of a problem, really, i already just 
auto-flow images into articles at regularly spaced intervals, and the 
client is happy with that approach

-- in-article footnotes that automatically link to (in this case) a 
popup window containing footnotes

-- in-article sidebar links that spawn a popup with some special 
information (like a QuickTime video, or Flash movie, or file 
download).

It sounds like their text will be originating from Microsoft Word, 
which is of course the bane of my existence, since I am a Unix guy.

So, my question is...how best to handle this problem?  The solution 
needs to be as quick and cheap as possible.  I see several 
alternatives:

(1) XML
Is it feasible to get any kind of XML output from Microsoft Word that 
could be parsed by a script and auto-imported?

(2) Visual Basic
Is it possible to write a VB script that would step through his Word 
documents and create an XML document, or something, that my script 
would parse, noting things like bolded text, footnotes, and other 
stuff along the way?

(3) ???
Can anyone share their strategy for this sort of thing?

Right now, believe it or not, I am leaning toward diving into 
REALbasic and coding my own cross-platform Windows/OS X XML document 
editor to sell to clients who make these kinds of requests, for them 
to prepare their Web-based documents in, rather than dealing with all 
the vagaries of going from Word to ASCII or Unicode-compatible 
textual content dynamically.

But maybe that is just an irrational reaction to the mounting tension 
in my head...

Ahem, you mean 4 or 5 hours for NY time.

Here's some code I made up for this purpose, though I've trimmed out stuff
that I don't believe is relevant to general use, but haven't thought of 
the full ramifications of whether it's really needed or not for your 
needs...

    /**
     * Determines if a given date/time combination is either Standard or
     * Daylight time in the US Eastern Time Zone.
     *
     * @param   string   $Time          time to be evaluated
     *                                   (<kbd>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</kbd>)
     *
     * @return  string   <samp>S</samp> if Eastern STANDARD Time.
     *                   <samp>D</samp> if Eastern DAYLIGHT Time.
     *                   <samp>U</samp> zone couldn't be set.
     */
    function getTimeType($Time) {

        $z = getenv('TZ');
        putenv('TZ=EST5EDT');

        $Sec = strtotime($Time);

        switch ( date('O', $Sec) ) {
            case '-0400':
                $Zone = 'D';
                break;
            case '-0500':
                $Zone = 'S';
                break;
            default:
                //  Try this instead.
                putenv('TZ=US/Eastern');

                switch ( date('O', $Sec) ) {
                    case '-0400':
                        $Zone = 'D';
                        break;
                    case '-0500':
                        $Zone = 'S';
                        break;

                }
        }

        putenv("TZ=$z");

        return $Zone;
    }

There are tons of TTW (Through The Web) editors out there that are 
basically javascript calling the freebies built in to IE and Mozilla. 
Most can handle cut-n-paste right from Word (as they use Microsoft's own 
code from IE).  Some of the most popular ones:

http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/
http://www.fredck.com/fckeditor/
http://link.altova.com/download_authentic.html
http://www.interakt.ro/products/KTML/index.php

There's even a website dedicated to them:
http://www.bris.ac.uk/is/projects/cms/ttw/ttw.html

You also have access to CMS that use them, like:

http://www.mamboserver.com/

...and you can even demo them ALL at:

http://www.opensourcecms.com/

DISCLAIMER: I am a Mambo developer, but other than that I like to see 
what everyone else is doing too :)

Most of the TTW editors out there let you add custom buttons, and I 
think this would work for you regarding footnotes, and some CMS include 
capabilities to provide a "what's related" sidebar.

HTH,

I would suggest reading:
Thinking XML: The open office file format
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-think15/

There are some resource links in that article
that also might prove to be useful.

I would be interested in hearing 
what you decide on.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL and ORDER BY kludging
Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125DC1B8FA@intamail1.inta>

Hey list,
Does anyone have experience with making MySQL do an ORDER BY for different
(or multiple) charsets?

I have DB full of unicode (single-byte, I think) strings and the default
ORDER BY is UTF-8 according the MySQL docs. They also mention that this can
be altered but I couldn't quite figure out how to go about it.

Predictably, there is an interest in getting the sort from the query such
that:

$query = 'Select distinct from MYDB where strings >="S" and strings < "T"';
would capture "S-like" strings starting with  [S,s,S,s,S,s,S,s,S,s], which
when UTF-8 sorted, the set [S,s,S,s,S,s,S,s] falls last, or > "Z"

and for another example, 'Select distinct from MYDB where strings >="C" and
strings < "D"'; would bring back strings starting with
[C,c,?,C,c,C,c,C,c,C,c].

Any insights?

You want to use MySQL 4.1. See:

http://www.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Presentations/MySQL-User-Conference-2003/National-Character-Sets-and-Unicode.pdf/from/pick

>From what I've read, you can get MySQL 4.1 to collate a table based on
a character set. I haven't actually played with this feature, however,
so I would be interested in your experiences.

Also, if you're using MySQL 4.1 with PHP 4, be sure to use the
--old-passwords flag and don't upgrade the password on any account
that uses the old mysql client to the larger length, or you'll be
stuck. :)

If you're using PHP 5, then you should download the latest MySQL 4.1.x
snapshot from http://snaps.mysql.com as the most recent packaged
version won't work.

Thanks for the tips, Adam.
Based on the docs, we'd have to make the leap from MySQL 3.5.x to <= MySQL
4.1.0 and soon after (or concurrently) migrate to mysqli_*().

Heavy stuff. However, if I am charged with such a task, I will be sure to
keep notes on the COLLATE feature and how it works out.

If you're using PHP 5, then you should download the latest MySQL 4.1.x

I am currently trying to figure out the best way to make this move.

My current thoughts are to first move to MySQL 4.1, then migrate to
PHP 5, then migrate to ext/mysqli.

This requires you to run MySQL 4.1 in backwards compatability mode
w/r/t password authentication until you make the final jump to
ext/mysqli, but I think it's worth it to ease the transition burden
because you won't need to make two simultaneous migrations.

It also allows you to start using ext/mysqli in your new projects
ASAP. Additionally, I think think that a server-side MySQL feature
like collation would still be accessible using the older ext/mysql
extension.

However, all this needs some serious testing. Right now, it's just
theory. :)

Hello All,

Not sure if this has already been discussed, but does anyone have a
recommendation for a solid, easy-to-implement survey system written in php &
mysql? Or maybe some suggestions on how to structure such an application? I
am not an advanced object-oriented programmer, but I do have a fair amount
of experience writing procedural php websites and lite applications.

I need the ability to:
1. Generate survey questions on the fly, using different formats such as
multiple-choice and short answers
2. Store results in a db and display results
3. Easily alter the look and feel

Thanks and best to all,
Dave

I've used phpESP before-- it works as advertised, but does take a little
time to learn your way around. I had to give nontechnical users a step
by step walkthrough, but they eventually picked it up. 

Customizing the survey template was a little rough-- it was change a
little bit of this file here, change a little of that file there. I got
to a point that was good enough for my purposes, but that could be a
real problem depending on your circumstances and the degree of
customization you need for your users.

We use it and have kinda forked it to get some extra functionality out of it
as the developer was slow to embrace new question types and formatting
features.  Some simple things like section headings, and text box sizing are
missing (or at least were when I last looked which has been a while).

We use it for our "light" surveys as its layout is pretty much fixed and the
data is kind of chunked out into different tables depending on question type
so that it takes some work to put it back together so you can have
meaningful column headings and data presented in a single table format for
analysis. Its own results page seems fairly capable but very rigid and I
believe is not intended to be shown to users (though I am sure you could
make it so).

Here is an example page: https://www.alexcommgrp.com/csg/csnsurvey0803.php

For heavy-duty surveys, we re-use in-house code and develop custom html and
datastructures to suit the survey.  

phpESP really wasn't too bad to work with and it may be a great start for
you as it was for us.

Mike, are you suggesting that it might be a good idea to start with some of
the code from phpESP and perhaps build on it and customize my own solution?
...especially if I want to be able to have rigid control over the
html/style?

Thanks
Dave

You can download and have it running in probably 10 minutes. so you can try
out a few survey ideas.  If you want to tinker under the hood, you can see
how painful this will be in checking out the one main script that does the
layout called funcs_render.php (one big loop going through all of the
questions) and the one script which defines how each type of question
renders in html, funcs_html.inc.  Take a look at both of these and you will
see the heart of the program.

It's hard for me to judge/help you really know if this worthwhile. It works
for me as I needed a survey tool that allowed non-programmers to set up
surveys that easily embed in our page templates with no need for quick
results.  

James Flemer is the author and he has been helpful in the past.  I think he
just wasn't interested in some of my changes and so we sort of moved on in
different directions.  I think that my previous comment about forking may
have been misleading about the helpfulness of the author.

[Warning: Shameless Plug!]

My new product, theBizConnector, has a section that does exactly what you 
are looking for (by your description), although the surveys created are 
intended to be embedded in emails.

The product uses web-based rich editors for non-technical users to create 
surveys on the fly - all underlying database support is created, enabling 
posting of responses by recipients and automatic tabulation of results in 
real time. The HTML produced could be used on a web page with slight 
modification.

To get a sample survey sent to you, go to http://www.theBizConnector.com 
and click on "Send a Sample Survey" in the middle of the page. I am trying 
to address the lack of 100% clarity of my marketing message, so please let 
me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for this opportunity for a shameless plug! - I hope this list does 
not mind.

Hi there:

Just replying to this since Tim said he was interested in what method I chose.

About my situation:  I am an independent developer whose clients are 
small business whose character or integrity I like, or non profits 
and documentary filmmakers.

Basically, this means people who have no money.  :)  Therefore, my 
decisions are generally made given that I have smaller budgets and 
fewer people (read: me) at my disposal.

So, after looking into all this stuff, I decided to take htmlArea and 
slap it in as an optional feature of my custom-built CMS, which I 
have been developing for years.

For me, design is the number one concern, so a pre-built CMS is 
really not an option.  Generally, their layout and design is 
structured around a fairly narrow set of potential uses; plus, you 
have to struggle against other people's code when you want to 
customize.  So, back in 1998, I chose to build my own system from the 
ground up.  It is great in some ways, and sorely lacking in others, 
but at least I know what every single line of code does without even 
thinking about it.

Part of the system is a form generation class, and an admin tool 
framework, which I reuse on projects, so I was concerned that merging 
something like this would cause me to have to make wholesale changes. 
However, I am, like, really pleasantly surprised to find that this 
htmlArea JavaScript component is able to be merged into my CMS, 
without disturbing one line of my code!  This makes me happy.  And 
the JS code is very well-written and amenable to customization.

Thanks to Mitch and Brent, for getting me on this track, and thanks 
for the heads-up about OpenOffice, too.  I really wish there were a 
common Word processor document standard based around XML so that 
files could easily be directly parsed.  That would be my preferred 
solution for this kind of thing, in the long run, but right now it's 
too much work, and Open Office isn't exactly idiot-proof yet on OS X 
(still running in X11).  Maybe we're a few years away from this being 
a viable option.

Cheers,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Inventory Management in PHP?
Message-ID: <40475D69.6030104@prusak.com>

Hi All,

I've been tasked to find a solution to an Inventory Management issue one 
of our clients currently has.

Currently they use a central Excel spreadsheet for their inventory 
management.
They manage items which are sold on a date basis (think TV advertising).

When a sales person wants to know inventory status, make a reservation 
or commit to a sale, they phone the spreadsheet owner to make their 
inquiry or request.
I'm looking for a simple PHP open source web based solution to this.
Users could check inventory status, make a reservation or commit to a 
sale all through the web interface.
The administrator could setup the different types of products and change 
inventory levels (when new products come in) as well administer the 
system's users.
It's important for the solution to be "date based". For example, a user 
could see what's available for the month of Jan in the 8:00 - 9:00 PM slot.

Has anyone ever used anything like this ?

I know this is a pretty straight forward project, but no point in 
re-inventing the wheel.

Thanx
Ophir

I just downloaded and setup today a GPL package called phpSERA which
performs search engine rankings on both an ad hoc and historical basis with
graphing.  You can find it here: http://phpsera.sourceforge.net/ 

So far it looks good and it takes about 5 minutes to setup.  I have been
looking for a package like this for a while and I figured others might be
interested in it as well.

If you want to check it out without getting your hands dirty, there is a
live demo linked off the website and screen shots.

Let's see what Panix has...

d> apropos pdf | grep text

  latex, elatex, lambda, pdflatex (1) - structured text formatting and
    typesetting
  pdftotext (1) - Portable Document Format (PDF) to text converter 
    (version 2.02)

That second one looks like it'll fit the bill.

d> man pdftotext
       ... snip ...
       Pdftotext  reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a text
       file, text-file.  If text-file is not specified, pdftotext
       converts  file.pdf  to file.txt.  If text-file is '-', the
       text is sent to stdout.
       ... snip ...

d> pdftotext afile.pdf - | grep stringicareabout

Works like a charm.

Enjoy,

Dan,

Isn't pdftotext part of the xpdf package?

Dan,

Ha, that is funny, I didn't know there was a binary xpdf. I have never used
it, just pdftotext. I am looking at the directory for xpdf and can see it
now. xpdf seems nice - renders much faster than acrobat and looks fairly
accurate.

I look forward to a nice fat heavy book about PEAR, preferably one with a
cute furry creature on the cover. When it's available I'll whip out my
credit card so fast it'll make your head spin. Even if it is out of date
the moment it hits the shelves.

I just felt like sharing that as I go nucking futs in my quest to learn to
use some of these packages. Thanks for letting me vent (-:

I second that. The other night I literally had to go for a walk around the
block to cool off after spending a couple hours getting nowhere trying to
learn DB_DataObject. Searching "DB_DataObject PEAR tutorial" in Google was
of no help either. Doing that mostly brought up mirrors of the same docs
found at pear.php.net

Does anyone have good resources for this stuff?

My book "Essential PHP Tools" covers PEAR DB, ADODB, HTML_QuickForm,
Smarty, XML_Parser, XML_RPC, SOAP, SimpleXML, Mail, Mail_mime, Auth,
Auth_HTTP, xdebug, apc, phpa, and mmcache.

Those aren't all PEAR modules but many of them are.

It should be out in a few weeks.

The only resource that I've ever found that actually works consistently is to actually read the code itself.

This isn't a smart-assed RTFC comment, bcs I would knock you down to get a PEAR book. I LOVE good documentation and I feel the lack of it takes away from the quality of the application itself.

But after repeatedly reading sparse tutorials or just getting NADA-doc dumps, I don't even watse my time anymore. There is good news when you go this route, though. First of all, PHP isn't Perl; you can read it even if you didn't write it. Secondly, there are often nice samples included with the package and the code is very clean.

The package that finally took me over the edge was HTML_QuickForm_Controller. If you use and love HTML_QucikForm, which I do, and you make a lot of multi-page applications and wizards, which I do, this is a magnificent package.

But can you get it to work?

First, google around a bit. Get nice and frustrated. Now, go to the source and open the samples provided. You'll be up and running suprisingly quickly.

So, I can't WAIT to get a good PEAR book. But in the meantime, I block off a chunk of time to read the code and any samples they may give me. In the end, its still quicker than rolling it yourself. But it isn't as quick as a nice reference would make it.

So with all this thrashing and cursing about the lack of docs, how come
nobody using (or learning to use) PEAR is signing on the the doc project?

question: How can PEAR be regarded as [so] great if it causes such angst
for what might be considered routine tasks?
(see admission above: maybe these tasks aren't so routine?)

i actually meant to ask this @ the last meeting ...

much of the core PHP stuff seems to be useless (maybe) without its
surrounding plugins/extensions/and PEAR ... I strongly beleive that if much
of what goes on (like PearDB) was completely built-in to PHP itself you
would have alot more people jumping into it - there seems to be no movement
for that (in PHP5 or discussion) ... which is odd because it already
contains a few built in classes.  Is there a flipside to creating good
extensions and then building them directly into the core so that they show
up in programming books + tutorials on their own?

That's because illegality is no deterrent to people who want to smoke
crack. Oops sorry now I'm OT-OT. Guess I'll go hit the pipe now.

Last time I checked, most mailboxes do "runneth over" with this crap, 
despite mailers paying for the privilege, albeit at a heavily discounted 
rate.

This was announced about a month ago.  Guess his PR people are looking to
get more recognition for the big man and the writers/editors at AP have no 
memory and/or just don't care.  Using news.google.com on
"gates pay email" I find the first references to this were on 2 Feb.

Beats me why folks think PEAR is so hard.  http://pear.php.net/manual/en/
is pretty clear.  I know the DB docs are up to date and have several usage
examples.

Mind you, if you'd read the article, you'd see that it isn't about money 
at all.  It's more of a sophisticated (if somewhat lame) challenge 
response system.  This isn't Bill or Microsoft's idea.  This kind of 
idea has been floated a number of times.  Implementing it would be 
horrifically difficult. 

And, oh, yeah, it wouldn't stop spam.  It would, for a time, slow down 
how long it took the spammers to send out spam.  But the system doesn't 
stop spam, just makes it more "expensive" in terms of CPU and 
bandwidth.   And both CPU and bandwidth are getting cheaper.  So...  Is 
it a good idea?  Not really.  Is it feasible?  No.  Does it have 
anything to do with cash?  No.  Is there a financial impact? Yes, both 
for the spammer and the intended recipient.

A hybrid system is a better choice.  But they're not as sexy.
Chris

But if everything was built in, PHP would be a lot slower and bloated.  
The extensions allow users to pick and choose what they need in order to 
have the most efficient system possible.

By the way, there is a movement to unify all of the database functions, 
which could ultimately obviate the need for PEAR DB, et al.

Message-ID: <C92A8F8B60F96B42911EFA70AF30A88F060A44DF@msp7-msx1.ingenix.com>

Hi list.

BASIC: apache 1.3.29, php 4.3.4, Mysql 1.3 on WIN2KPro

ISSUE: php_info() shows that the extensions_dir points to a directory that
does not exists (c:\php4), and since it is pointing somewhere where I could
not find it, my modules (like gd) are not being loaded.

WHAT HAVE I DONE SO FAR?
I have made appropriate changes to php.ini and placed the whole php related
components under C:\php.
I have included C:\php in my System's Path.  That does show in the info from
php_info()
I have stopped and restarted apache
All related php dll files are under C:\php
I have done search and there is NO other php.ini under any drive or dir
except c:\php.ini (where it should be).
Re-started the machine, and than restarted Apache, 
the entry in C:\php\php.ini is:
extension_dir= "C:\php\extensions"

ADDITIONAL INFO: In my apache httpd-conf file, I have the following entries:

LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll
AddModule mod_php4.c  <<<< NOTE: I did a search on it and there is no
mod_php4.c in my c drive.

I am not sure what else to do.  Any ideas are deeply appreciated.

I just downloaded and setup today a GPL package called phpSERA which
performs search engine rankings on both an ad hoc and historical basis with
graphing.  You can find it here: http://phpsera.sourceforge.net/ 

So far it looks good and it takes about 5 minutes to setup.  I have been
looking for a package like this for a while and I figured others might be
interested in it as well.

If you want to check it out without getting your hands dirty, there is a
live demo linked off the website and screen shots.

Hello,

I was trying to search for strings in a pdf file that is on the unix system.

I looked for other tools to
search in pdf files but so far I have found none. Is there a way in Unix 
itself like the grep command or something else that can help me search for 
strings in pdf files?

If anyone knows about it, then please kindly let me know.

Thanks,
Salman.

I am using xpdf to get text out of pdfs.  You can get it here

Let's see what Panix has...

d> apropos pdf | grep text

  latex, elatex, lambda, pdflatex (1) - structured text formatting and
    typesetting
  pdftotext (1) - Portable Document Format (PDF) to text converter 
    (version 2.02)

That second one looks like it'll fit the bill.

d> man pdftotext
       ... snip ...
       Pdftotext  reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a text
       file, text-file.  If text-file is not specified, pdftotext
       converts  file.pdf  to file.txt.  If text-file is '-', the
       text is sent to stdout.
       ... snip ...

d> pdftotext afile.pdf - | grep stringicareabout

Works like a charm.

Enjoy,

Isn't pdftotext part of the xpdf package?

Dan,

Ha, that is funny, I didn't know there was a binary xpdf. I have never used
it, just pdftotext. I am looking at the directory for xpdf and can see it
now. xpdf seems nice - renders much faster than acrobat and looks fairly
accurate.

I look forward to a nice fat heavy book about PEAR, preferably one with a
cute furry creature on the cover. When it's available I'll whip out my
credit card so fast it'll make your head spin. Even if it is out of date
the moment it hits the shelves.

I just felt like sharing that as I go nucking futs in my quest to learn to
use some of these packages. Thanks for letting me vent (-:

I second that. The other night I literally had to go for a walk around the
block to cool off after spending a couple hours getting nowhere trying to
learn DB_DataObject. Searching "DB_DataObject PEAR tutorial" in Google was
of no help either. Doing that mostly brought up mirrors of the same docs
found at pear.php.net

Does anyone have good resources for this stuff?

My book "Essential PHP Tools" covers PEAR DB, ADODB, HTML_QuickForm,
Smarty, XML_Parser, XML_RPC, SOAP, SimpleXML, Mail, Mail_mime, Auth,
Auth_HTTP, xdebug, apc, phpa, and mmcache.

Those aren't all PEAR modules but many of them are.

It should be out in a few weeks.

The only resource that I've ever found that actually works consistently is
to actually read the code itself.

This isn't a smart-assed RTFC comment, bcs I would knock you down to get a
PEAR book. I LOVE good documentation and I feel the lack of it takes away
from the quality of the application itself.

But after repeatedly reading sparse tutorials or just getting NADA-doc
dumps, I don't even watse my time anymore. There is good news when you go
this route, though. First of all, PHP isn't Perl; you can read it even if
you didn't write it. Secondly, there are often nice samples included with
the package and the code is very clean.

The package that finally took me over the edge was
HTML_QuickForm_Controller. If you use and love HTML_QucikForm, which I do,
and you make a lot of multi-page applications and wizards, which I do, this
is a magnificent package.

But can you get it to work?

First, google around a bit. Get nice and frustrated. Now, go to the source
and open the samples provided. You'll be up and running suprisingly quickly.

So, I can't WAIT to get a good PEAR book. But in the meantime, I block off a
chunk of time to read the code and any samples they may give me. In the end,
its still quicker than rolling it yourself. But it isn't as quick as a nice
reference would make it.

So with all this thrashing and cursing about the lack of docs, how come
nobody using (or learning to use) PEAR is signing on the the doc project?

May I suggest:

"Essential PHP Tools: Modules, Extensions, and Accelerators" by David Sklar?

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590592808/trachtenberg-20/noref

It's coming out this month. No cute furry creatures, but an excellent
book nevertheless. Especially if you like ice cream.

Message-ID: <011f01c402ee$d11d0af0$6f01a8c0@iifwp.local>

Hi All,

I wonder if anyone here has experience implementing a lost-password-recovery
function on a login-based website.  We're soon to be opening up our
membership database to allow each individual to edit his or her own records.
Naturally we have a login system in place, which our core staff is already
using to access the database, but as of now any lost passwords would be
replaced manually by the administrator.  If we open it to hundreds of people
that will be too much to handle, so I need to develop a way for people to do
it themselves (probably using an email address on file).  I'm sure I can
create something that works, but I'm not confident yet to create something
that both works and is fairly secure.

I googled around but couldn't find fruitful keywords.  Anybody have some
recommendations on how best to handle this feature, or some place on the Web
to look around?

Thanks,
Allen

A fairly standard approach is to simply generate a new random password 
and send it to the email address you have on file.

If you have additional data about your clients on file you may be able 
to implement a system which used that data to authenticate the client, 
either then allowing them to change their password online or request a 
new password be sent to their stored email address.

Message-ID: <4048E59B.4060102@next-online.net>

A better approach is:

On a request to recover the password,
Make sure the email address matches what is in the database,
Then change the password in the database to some random value,
Then send the user an email (using the email in the database) with a 
link to a page where the user can change the password.
Make sure the emailed link can only be used once.

If you send their password to them via email, it's in plain text and can 
be fairly easily intercepted.

You can improve on the above by adding challenge questions (Mother's 
maiden name, What was the name of your high school, etc), but assumes 
you've gathered those questions/answers during the registration process.

You probably also want to have a unique link in the email (or some similar
mechanism) that the user needs to visit in order to activate the new
password. Otherwise, random people can reset your users' passwords, which
is a hassle for them.

I recently set up such a thing in the manner Dan Cech just described. I
used the PEAR Auth package (speaking of PEAR again (-:) and the passwords
are stored as md5 hashes, indecipherable even to the admin, so it wasn't
optional, I had to use the technique of resetting and emailing them their
new password. I stole this password generator from someplace, it seems
Good Enough for these purposes, but if someone has a better one I'll steal
that too.

function create_passwd() {
        $i=0;$pwd='';
        while ($i<9){
                srand((double)microtime()*1000000);
                $num=rand(0,255);
                $txt=chr($num);
                if (eregi("^[a-z0-9]$", $txt)) {
                        $pwd=$pwd . $txt;
                        $i++;
                }
        }
        return $pwd;

Message-ID: <12EB01FD-6EEA-11D8-9564-0003930D07F2@email.smith.edu>

I am working on a page right now that uses HTTP_REFERER to make sure 
that the user is coming from a specific page.  It seems to be working 
pretty well except for one little hiccup involving the back button:

Scenario:
The user clicks from the referrer page to my page and is let in OK.  
When they are done they leave and go somewhere else.  However, if they 
choose to hit the back button they are let into my page again.  I would 
like to know how I can prevent this from happening?

I tried playing around with meta tags like content no-cache and things 
of that sort to prevent the browser from storing in memory but it has 
not had the desired effect.

So I'd be interested in some tips/pointers on how to prevent the back 
button being able to be used to get back into my page and also 
suggestions if there is a better way than http_referer to accomplish my 
goals of restricting access.

Thanks,

-Aaron

I have done something simular where I set a session variable to track where
they initially came from the first time they hit the page. As for subsequent
requests, if the session variable is set, I do not have to worry about it.
Not sure though if this would fit your application though.

I don't have ownership of the referring page so I can't ask them to set 
a session variable. Maybe I could set one on my page that would do the 
trick.

I'm thinking I could set it up so that if the session variable exists I 
won't let them back in.  The only way they will be able to get back in 
is to go to the referring page, which is what I want.  Does this sound 
like I'm on the right track?

Either way, it looks like I may need to delve into the sessions areas 
of my php books to learn more!

Okay, I'm thinking to do something like this:

I need a 3-column table, something like this:

CREATE TABLE `pwd_request` (
  `requestid` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `userid` int(11) NOT NULL default '',
  `pwd` varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`requestid`)
) TYPE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

* user requests password replacement
* password is reset to random value, which is stored in a new record,
    along with userid of this user
* get pwd_request.requestid for that new record
* using email address on file, a link like this is sent to the user:
  <? echo
"http://mydomain.com/password.php?id=$new_request_id&pwd=$rand_pwd&userid=$u
serid"; ?>

When the user accesses that given URL
* password.php queries for a record in pwd_request matching on 3 fields
* if record is found, delete that record and display form to receive new
password
    (If no record is found, display error message and accept no changes.
This
    way we prevent the link from being used twice.)
* apply new password to user's actual record.

The mechanics of this definitely make sense to me, and it seems safe enough.
Thanks Dan, Chris, and others for your input.

With a standards-compliant browser, you shouldn't be able to. As a
standards-conscious developer, you shouldn't want to.

Chris, what you say is true, but I think Aaron would be okay to show them
what they saw before (exactly what the user saw at the time when  the
resource was retrieved").  Seems like he's trying to prevent them from
having the page reloaded with new information off the server.  Isn't that a
different thing?

I can't solve your specific problem, but HTTP_REFERER is really easy
to fake, so don't be relying on this in general as a secure method of
protection against anything or anyone.

Can you clarify this?  Are you saying that a standards-compliant 
browser should show me the page again regardless of what I do, and as a 
standards-conscious developer I should not try and restrict them from 
hitting back and seeing the page?

Hhmmm, when considering pages that contain sensitive information it 
seems problematic to leave the history transparent.  For example, if I 
am banking online and leave the banking site and then leave my computer 
unattended, I don't want someone else to be able to sit down and hit 
the back buttons or history buttons to see my private information.  Of 
course, I wouldn't let that happen  But, I am designing with the lowest 
common denominator in mind.  That is, the user with the least amount of 
technical information and/or the greatest propensity to leave 
themselves vulnerable to such exploits.  Isn't it my responsibility as 
a developer to do everything possible to protect the user's sensitive 
information from being viewed by parties other than themselves?

Actually, I am trying to restrict what they saw before, in case "they"

I'm interested to hear about this also.  I've notice that on some sites,
when a logged-in user chooses to log-out he can't back-button and get the
most recent page, but he can back-button back to the page where he logged
in, hit reload, and he's in.  On some other sites, though, I have not been
able to recreate this behavior (hotmail is an example).  This seems much
more secure.

Thanks Adam, I would guess as much.  In this specific instance I think 
it will be OK.  It is extremely unlikely that there will be any 
motivation to fake it and trick the page into loading.

However, for future use, and possibly for this one, can you give me 
some recommendations for what I should start reading up on when 
considering security?  Perhaps the question is too broad?  I would 
guess that sessions would be one area to explore.

I think you are trying to come to a solution in the wrong way.

First you should not ever rely on HTTP_REFERER because some browsers
dont even choose to sent them or a proxy is stripping them so i would
not have any of my app's logic rely on the REFERER header.

Second you should not worry about sites that your appliation does not
control. If you are not the guy who sent the user the html page so then
it should not be up to you to decide if the user cannot go back to that
page.

I can see a case where its resonable to wipe the browsers history for
your application only. I never had a  needed to do this but here is a
few ideas you may try.  Some of them may not work.
1. Put your app in a popup , probably not a good idea.
2. Use javascript and manipulate the history object, but make sure you
are nice and dont wipe the history you did not create.
3. Let all your application requests go through same url , maybe some
browsers dont add a history for that.
4. Use 304 redirects because browsers wont add those to history. I am
not sure where this would be useful though.

Has anyone encountered a segmentation fault before? Any hints on how to
debug?

I have a simple script that open a set of urls and saves them locally. This
script is called through a fork on a page, and  I noticed that very rarely
the process died before finishing the download.

After investigating a bit, I found out that calling the process from the
command line (or through a web page) gave me a segmentation fault.
I thought I could reproduce the problem (it was happening only with certain
parameters) but when it does happen, it will abort execution without
echoing anything, so debuging through echo statements did not working.

I started  commenting sections of the code and managed to narrow the
problem to a call to file_get_contents (segmentation wouldn't happen with
other urls, so I thought I had it), but even so, the problem doesn't happen
all the time. I'm running PHP 4.3.1

Remember, strace is your friend.  It looks pretty daunting when you
first run it, but if you have some programming background, e.g. this
isn't your first program (or programming language) you can sort of
figure out what the program was trying to do at the time.

There's alot of stuff in the strace output that is Very Scary but ignore
it.

Something like this might help:

strace -f -o /tmp/output_file /path/to/your/executable.php

Speaking POP (or any email protocol) isn't really related to attachments.
You could, for example, send HTTP packets over email if you really wanted
to.  In fact, you could send IP packets if you have nothing to do.

For IMAP there's of course:  http://us2.php.net/imap

And for pop, phpclasses.org probably has you covered.  I haven't had to
speak POP myself, so I'm lucky.

I have, however, had to parse email messages a lot, and this means MIME.  So
much so, I wrote my own parser, which is actually generic to MIME
(http/email/etc).  It's attached and I'd be happy for any feedback.  I'm
using it in production and all has been happy, but I'm always ready for
patches, etc.

wild guess:  this has something to do with block mode:  see

You're on the right track.

Found the following:

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-generic.php

It notes that: "The data is padded with "\0" to make sure the length of 
the data is n * blocksize."

Additionally, I'm base64_encoding the string and then serializing it

You may want to try using file_get_contents() instead of fread(). It's
more efficient and might solve the problem as a side effect.

1. Feds: E-mail subpoena ruling hurts law enforcement
By: Kevin Poulsen

An appeals court refuses to reconsider a ruling that an overbroad subpoena
for stored e-mail can qualify as a computer intrusion, despite a plea from
the Justice Department to rethink the decision.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] var_dump says "&object(myobj)(10)"
Message-ID: <003a01c4060e$5cea8a40$6f01a8c0@iifwp.local>

Debugging a little, looking at results of var_dump($_SESSION), and noticed
this mysterious (to me) thing:

With register_globals=off, the object $myobj is listed with an ampersand,
like so:
  ["_SESSION"]=>
  array(1) {
    ["myobj"]=>
   object(myclass)(14) {
.... etc. ...

With register_globals=on, the ampersand goes missing, like so:
  ["_SESSION"]=>
  array(1) {
    ["myobj"]=>
   object(myclass)(14) {
.... etc. ...

Can anyone tell me what that ampersand is?  (Googling for "var_dump
ampersand", etc. is getting me little help...)

Thanks,
Al

> Can anyone tell me what that ampersand is?

Ampersands refer to references.  Example:

<?php
$x['a'] = 'one';
$x['b'] =& $x['a'];
$x['c'] = 'three';

var_dump($x);

$x['a'] = 'two';

var_dump($x);
?>

Output:

array(3) {
  ["a"]=>
  &string(3) "one"
  ["b"]=>
  &string(3) "one"
  ["c"]=>
  string(5) "three"
}
array(3) {
  ["a"]=>
  &string(3) "two"
  ["b"]=>
  &string(3) "two"
  ["c"]=>
  string(5) "three"
}

Notice how I changed the value of b by changing the value of a.

Thanks.  Actually, I thought it was something like that, but without knowing
more, do you have any guess as to why changing register_globals would affect
whether it gets added as a reference or not?

I'll toss in a guess - but it's complete speculation:

With register_globals turned on, the values all get put in a single massive
symbol table (or heap, or whatever) and all values are references. With it
turned off, the symbol table can be managed more effectively, and you get
values in place of those references.

Of course, I could be way off - I can envision what's going on but my lack
of scholastic training in the subject serves to limit my vocabulary.

Hi Folks:

Thought the following article might be of interest...

Open-source software is popping up everywhere, from PCs and cellphones to 
giant corporate and government systems. Today the biggest challenge 
confronting virtually every major software maker is chillingly simple: How 
do you compete with programs that can be had free?

Heh! So that's how they do it.

Reminds me of an anecdote. While re-organizing my home office the other
day, and trying like hell to throw away useless crap despite my pack-rat
nature, I came across a CD containing --- Windows 98! Reflexively, I tried
to think of an excuse to keep it. After meditating on this question for
two seconds I threw it in the trash.

This isn't the sexiest and most thrilling of topics, but I'm just curious.

When you guys store 10 digit phone numbers in a MySQL database, generally
speaking, how do you do it -- data type, width, format? Do you strip all
the non-digits so as to make them format-agnostic, and reformat them at
fetch time? Or do you enforce a format like (xxx) xxx-xxxx so they'll all
be consistent? Do you keep a separate column for an optional extension, or
allow enough width for "(xxx) xxx-xxxx Ext.xxxx" ?

Hey you in the back of the room, stop snoring.

Thanks,

(snaps head up)  Hey who what the...  Oh.

I used to break them up as separate fields, but that can get messy as 
soon as you go international.  Since then I store:

    area_code
    prefix
    suffix
    extension

..and get the country code from their address.  If no address, then you 
need to get that too.  In the 30 or so countries I've targeted with 
weblications, I've never seen an alpha character in use, unless you 
count stuff like 1-800-big-blob or something like that.  By using PEAR's 
HTML_QuickForm, it is pretty easy to ensure you are only getting numeric 
data - and providing helpful messages too.

Jeez I'm awful sorry to disturb you again but... you do store them as
string types, right? If they were actually numeric in the data layer (as
opposed to the form input) and there were a leading zero somewhere it
sounds like it could get ugly.

PS I am loving that QuickForm, oh yesssssss.

I've always used the argument that two pieces of data are numeric if you
can add (subtract, etc.) them together and get another number.  Since
you can't do that with phone numbers (or social security number, etc.),
they are not numbers.

Uh, er, oh yeah, that's what I meant.

Using QuickForm you can guaranteee getting nothing but numeric input, 
but you cannot store it in the database as integers because of that 
reason - but the solution varies depending upon what database you are 
working with.  Safest to store as char data, unless you want to get funky.

Speaking of funky, I remember once learning how to create my own 
user-defined datatypes by inheriting classes of other types for 
PostgreSQL, but I can't remember the exact sequence of magic 
incantations...  [sound of ruffling pages]  Oh, you could store the 
numbers individually in an array, yuck.  Oh, here's the ditty on PG's 
user defined types:

I believe that the storing of the phone numbers would fall under the 
"display agnostic" theory as noted in the PHundamentals article on 
storing and retrieving data. Besides, by storing just the numbers (as 
strings, of course) means you can display it using hyphens or with 
parens or whatever may be needed.

Yeah, although there's the theoretical problem of leading zeroes. However,
as long as it's a number in the US, you can be sure that no such number
exists. In fact, I often check for valid area codes in my data filtering
logic.

I'm not as certain about international numbers, but I'm sure you can find
a definitive list. You could also store this data separately, since it's
not really part of the phone number itself.

I should have mentioned that this only exists if you're using an int field
to store the number, which isn't what I do. I was just following along
with the conversation. :-)

I would go with using a varchar field and storing only the data, as Jeff
suggested.

Hello,

as far as i know there isn't a random function within mysql3 or mysql4. You
might create a random value using a php function and use this value as index
for retrieving a record.

Ha! I didn't know rand() yet. The use here is very interesting. I'll try
this one my own when i have need for some randomness again.

I've never seen this solution before. Very simple.
I wondering though about the efficiency of this solution.

It seems to me that this assigns a random value to each row and then 
orders by that row.
Does the DB do a full table scan using this method?

If yes, this would be a very inefficient method for very large tables.

It is inefficient if you are retrieving the whole table ordered by 
RAND(), but with the LIMIT clause, the table scan is short-circuited 
after one row is found. So,

SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY RAND()

can be slow if there are a lot of rows in the table, but

SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1

is OK.

Not sure of the efficiency of rand, but I've been using it for a while..
Very useful.

Another way you could do it is to generate a random number from 0 to the
record count and use a limit query.

I hear what you're saying, but I'm still not convinced.

Any select query with an ORDER BY clause requires the database to do 
some sorting before returning results.

I did a quick Google search and found this thread on the subject:
http://lists.mysql.com/mysql/161338

The short answer is that if you're doing this for a table with a very 
large number of rows, there are more efficient ways than ORDER BY RAND().
Read the above thread for details.

I'll definitely use the LIMIT clause. After all, I only need one record. 
In addition, I'll have some parameters in a where clause so that if it 
comes back with a previously used record (I'm tracking that info)...I'll 
rerun/regenerate the query. Probably just do it in a loop and then exit 
out of the loop once I've found an unused record.

Another method would be to add an extra column to the table to track the 
number of times each record has been used, then you could do the following:

SELECT count(*) FROM mytable WHERE times_used=0;

then use that result in a call to mt_rand to get a random offset:

$random_offset = mt_rand (0, $max - 1);

and grab the row with:

$row = SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE times_used=0 LIMIT $random_offset, 1;

Then update the table with the id from the row:

UPDATE mytable SET times_used=times_used+1 WHERE id_column=$id;

Honestly I can't tell you if there is an advantage to this method over 
the simple:

SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE times_used=0 ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1;

but I would be very interested to see how it worked out, especially with 
regards to how each solution scaled with the number of rows in the table.

Note: for either of these solutions to be efficient the times_used 
column would have to be indexed.

Hi:

I'm looking for opinions on what IDE raid cards are good performers and cost
wise what is suggested. I'm looking to do simple mirroring and the ability
to have 4 or more drives. Yes, I understand IDE raid is not as good as SCSI
raid at the moment and I do use SCSI raid for my primary systems, but I
would like to implement an IDE raid for backup purposes. I currently use a
scsi perc 3 card with 128 megs of memory so I'm used to the feature set of a
card of that type.

So what do you guys recommend? Please list features/cost . Thanks a bunch

Everyone I know that has needed this functionality in a moderate- to
low-cost solution goes with Promise100 controllers and multiple identical
drives of their own liking, though most end up being Western Digital.

I do not reccomend the Promise Controller if you plan to run Linux. I got
stuck with two machines that had a built in promise IDE RAID controller and
ended up having to disable the onborad promise controllerse and go with
software RAID because they do not support the latest linux kernels. If you
do not mind running outdated kernels with security problems, than perhaps
the promise controller will be fine. If you are a concerned linux admin,
than it is best to steer clear of the promise RAID controller all together.

I dunno seems they are making it seem like PHP sucks and is bad because it
does not work "well" with FrontPage and they suck the reading in from using
to PHP to downloading the .Net framework at no cost ...

Also its a misprint:

"With PHP, there is no concept of private, public, or protected functions in
classes as well as in the overloading."

Someone should send Bill a copy of PHP5 :-)

OK Solution: 3Ware Escalade 7506 4 Port or 8 Port for IDE drives

	- Slower than Linux software mirror

	- Poor overall RAID stability, upon initializing the RAID for the
first time, the RAID will re-initialize itself upon your first data write
to the disk.

Better Solution: Adaptec Serial ATA Raid 2410 (4 port) for 2810 (8 port)

	- Better performance than 3Ware

	- Better overall RAID stability

Personally I have had a love/hate relationship with RAID.  I purchased 
one of the first ever mainboards with onboard RAID, an ABIT KA7-100 
which was using a Highpoint (HPT370) chip, and 2 of then then top of the 
line 20GB WD drives.  Unfortunately for me, I never managed to get it to 
work properly, and in the end gave up on RAID for a while.

My latest experience was with the Promise FasTrak SX4000, which at the 
time I set it up was the latest and greatest in IDE RAID.  I cannot say 
enough good things about this card, or the Western Digital J series (in 
my case WD800JB) drives.  I put 256MB of RAM in the card and built a 
RAID 5 array for a total of 240Gb of storage space.

Unfortunately my machine was using a no-name 300W PSU which couldn't 
handle the load of the 4 Western Digitals, plus another 2 non-RAID 
drives, etc and was having serious power issues.  The result of this was 
that every few days the RAID would drop a drive and have to be rebuilt, 
this occurred 4 or 5 times before I figured out what was going on and 
replaces the PSU, since then the machine and RAID have been solid as a 
rock (and at no time did I lose any data).

I know there are sources available for at least some of the promise 
cards, and I believe the 2.6 kernel has support for the TX4 family of 
cards.  I haven't used the Promise cards under linux myself so YMMV.

The adaptec cards pointed out by Michael Hanulec look like they might be 
just the ticket though.

I would definitely recommend you go with the WD drives, I have been very 
happy with them in the past and they seem to work well in RAID setups.

 "What is PHP" at:
http://office.microsoft.com 

Microsoft's information (network) seems like it might be 
suffering from a propagation delay of about one year.

The PHP they seem to be talking about is what PHP looked like 
about 12-13 months ago.

I have read articles about PHP 5 that were no longer 
accurate after 2-3 weeks.

It is little wonder they want to compare the asp/net 
framework with last year's PHP -- look at what they 
want developers to use: Front Page 2003

Hmm.. let's see

1) ASP.NET: robust but expen$ive and lovingly provided, at major co$t, 
by Micro$oft.
2) PHP: robust (version 5+), free and lovingly provided at NO cost period
3) Frontpage: ACK!!!!

Again proving the superiority of PHP (and TCL) and the inferiority of 
ASP, whatever version it's in now.  "Encapsulated" of course.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Does PHP (versions 4+) offer an alternative to Java
	RMI?
Message-ID: <4050D040.8010800@adnet-sys.com>

I am looking into designing a means of PHP scripts to interact with an 
existing Java servlet on a remote site.  The servlet, however, 
instantiates classes that will be run on the remote server's JVM, and I 
was also hoping to integrate the results into a Java applet, however, 
the applet will, of course instantiate on the user's JVM on their 
machine and not the remote machine's JVM.  

Using RMI has been proven (by my limited Java knowledge of programming + 
architecture) to be too difficult to successfully achieve, and seeing 
the increated robustness of PHP I am inclined to think there could be 
some kind of "RMI" or even some object messaging service PHP could do to 
obtain stuff from a java servlet.

Has anyone ever done anything like this before?

Thanx
Phil

xml_rpc is certainly not a replacement for java rmi
xml_rpc is simply a by value type of remote call while java rmi offers
access to java objects as if you are accessing them by reference on
local machine. 

In php there is probably nothing like rmi because the execution model is
not similar. You be better of use xml_rpc or a simple HTTP POST

I don't know how much help I'll be able to glean from this list for this
problem, simply because the problem is fairly specific and there are so many
variables involved, but I'll throw it out there anyway.

Problem:

I get error messages like:
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: mysql_connect() and
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: mysql_get_client_info()

when I try to execute scripts that use mysql functionality. This means that
the mysql module is not working properly. I know that much.

Details:

Debian Woody system with apache-ssl (from stable) and php 4.3.4 (from
moolfret). Both installed with apt-get. Mysql 4.0.X installed manually from
binary available at mysql mirrors.

Problem started after I did a remove / re-install of php4 (apt-get remove
php4, apt-get install php4.)

I DID make sure to `apt-get install php4-mysql`

The mysql module is not listed on a 'phpinfo()' page. However, the
configuration line lists mysql info in it.

DB_Dataobject CAN communicate with the database!

At this point I'm ready to remove and re-install both php and apache-ssl,
but I'd like to avoid doing both if necessary. Esp. apache, as the config is
fairly customized.

Question:

Is there something I'm missing configuration-wise? has anyone else had
problems with the mysql module loading?

Thanks team!

I know this is Off Topic, but I'm sure someone on this list will have some
ideas.

A client of mine has found someone using his intellectual property without
authorization (no, it is not p0rn!).  This is not the first this happened,
so he proceeds to go to internic.net and look up the registrar info.  Well,
needless to say, the phone number is bogus, and the address turns up nothing
in reverse lookup (but the address appears valid, but it is in the midwest).
My client calls his web host, who of course won't give out any info (which
is understandable), but they do slip and inform my client that he has *many*
sites hosted with them.

My questions to you are:
1. Can you think of any other way to get info on this guy?
2. Any way to find out what domains he has registered?  His internic record
didn't have a handle that you could search by - I'm not sure, that may only
be a Network Solutions thing, and he didn't register with NS.

The guy is now "on the run".  He took down the site, and deactivated his
email address.  My client's concern is that this fellow will just take the
stolen property and put it on another site.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Tom

Not sure how HTTP POST will help in this case.  The Java servlet returns 
a java String[] serializable object, which normally would go to an 
applet.  What would you recommend I use, either in Java, preferably in 
PHP, that could read this object and properly handle it?

Not sure if this will help, but...

You can have the remote servlet deconstruct its remote array of Strings and
then send you a GET request in the format:
/clientpage/?stringItem=This+String&stringItem=That+String

You can then reconstruct the String[] locally in Java (or a PHP equivalent)
with this:
String[] arrValues = request.getParameterValues("stringItem");


Check out the Java Servlet APIs for more information on how it handles
requests and responses over HTTP:

I'm trying to create Captchas and it seems the hosting company does not 
have Freetype support enabled. The following comes from the phpinfo 
function:

PHP 4.3.2 on FreeBSD

GD Support 	enabled
GD Version 	bundled (2.0.15 compatible)
GIF Read Support 	enabled
JPG Support 	enabled
PNG Support 	enabled
WBMP Support 	enabled
XBM Support 	enabled

Just wondering what kind of workaround there might be...or if there 
isn't any.

Hey gang,
it never occured to me before but I note that it *appears* that the 'var'
keyword is only allowed in classes in PHP 4. AFAIK, using it in a PHP4
function is verboten.

Since we have some serious dev-listers here, I though I'd pose the question
whether or not this is one of the things that's changing in PHP5 - I'm going
to go on thinking it will be able to be used with the increased class
functionality in order to support public, private, etc.

As usual, it's open speculation and telling me I'm blatantly incorrect! - it
was nice to see the list hopping again yesterday after being quiet most of
the week!

Correct.  It's used in Object Oriented Programming.  Var defines 
properties' default values.  Note that they need to be defined outside of 
methods (nb: in classes, functions are called methods).   Example:

class foo {
    var $x = 'y';
    function bar() {
    }
}

var is deprecated in PHP 5, raising a new E_STRICT warning.  Instead of 
using var, use public, private, protected, etc.

It's not a big deal.  E_STRICT is off by default.  So, you can take most 4
code and run it on 5 w/o any changes.

That's good news.

Still -- when my code does things that are deprecated I feel -- what's the
opposite of warm and fuzzy? -- like I oughta update it lest it come back
and bite me some distant day. Not to turn this into a psychotherapy
session or anything....

You're right.  But, fortunately, there's no rush.

Nope :) It's canon!

The story:
Back in high school there was some be-happy-friendly type camp thing
sponsored by the school district. All the participants were given an angora
thread as a "Warm Fuzzy". When you wanted to give someone kudos, you put the
Fuzzy over their head like a lei, and said some gofy thing about why you're
giving them your Warm Fuzzy.

When you pissed someone off by being rude or crass or whatever, they called
it a Cold Prickly, and any Warm Fuzzies you had accrued were returned to
their owners, or perhaps given to ther person you annoyed.

Looking back on it now it sounds like a schoolyard psychology experiment -
and oh, so very wrong...

I thought of that but then it would seem to kinda defeat the purpose of 
a captcha since one could write some simple script to just read the html 
and figure out the sequence of numbers/letters based on the filenames.

Another thought was to have these files in some non-doc root directory 
and then copy them - using randomly generated new names - as needed and 
then removing them when no longer needed...but I'm not nuts over that idea.

In the interim, I'm using the GD lib's built-in bitmap fonts...not great 
looking but okay for now.

I think the intent was to use the imagecopy function to build your basic 
text string out of pre-made png images, then apply whatever obfuscation 
technique to the resulting montage, and output a single image.

It could work quite well, especially if you had a large pool of pre-made 
letters to draw from.

Yes, that's what I intended for you to do...

you could also use simple silhouette shapes to further confound debunkers

circle, square, elephant, automobile, etc...

the problem with the built in text is that size is limited..

Message-ID: <.38.117.145.89.1079111508.squirrel@www.bpang.com>

I've been using imagettftext when creating images on the fly and have been
running into some weirdness with text alignment

it varies from font to font, but what happens is that certain
strings/letter combinations shift the baseline from character to
character.

For example, using arial.ttf (ripped off WinXP, but why should that
matter?) the string "111"
appears as:
111
but each sequential digit's baseline is a pixel or so lower than the
previous digit.

But, the same string is ok when using verdana.ttf (again, ripped from WinXP)

However, verdana had a similar problem whenever an "a" followed a "T"
such that in the string "Tapioca"
the baseline for the letter "T" is a pixel or so HIGHER than the rest of
the string.

Has anyone else noticed this? I haven't seen anything on php.net or in
google searches. Would it be considered a bona-fide bug?

I have tried numerous solutions, short of drawing out each char and
imagecopymerge-ing them as has been suggested to Jeff for his Captcha. For
me, there is enough text that it would probably be really slow.

That's a good idea. I'm going to see if the ISP can do something 
concerning the GD lib before I go down this road.

Message-ID: <C92A8F8B60F96B42911EFA70AF30A88F060A451F@msp7-msx1.ingenix.com>

Hello List:  I am very new and hoping to get some help in terms of reading
an array (I have tried but failing)

BASIC: apache 1.3.29, PHP 4.3.4, MySQL 4.0.17-nt on WIN2K-Pro

I have data as :
category	month1	month2	month3
abc		100		99		100
xyz		98		99		89

etc...

QUESTION:
I need to geteach row in in variable so I could use it in a line graph or
as:

$datax=array(100,99,100)   //to be laid out, I will use $datax in my graph
plot line

There would be 6 rows that I need 6 lines.

I have the table in a table in Mysql

PROBLEM:
I have no idea how can I read the table so each row is assigned to a
varaible that I oculd use as example above.

I have read and re-read arcticles, but I am missing things..any help in
formulating this block is truly appreciated.

Regards,

Rafi

do your query, then with the $result...

while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result))
{
// this will need to be put into an array if you get multiple rows, so...
array_push($plotdata,
array($row['category'],$row['month1'],$row['month2'],$row['month3']));
}
Bear in mind that column names are case-senseitive from the query to the
associative index name. When using select *, the indices in $row will be
*exactly* as the column names are in the table.

let me modify that a little...

WAS:
array_push($plotdata,
array($row['category'],$row['month1'],$row['month2'],$row['month3']));

SHOULD BE:
array_push($plotdata,
 array('category' => $row['category'],'month1' => $row['month1'], 'month2'
=> $row['month2'], 'month3' =>$row['month3']));

Sorry about that!! :)

One of my favorite was of doing this is a one liner.

After you get the $result from the query...

for($i=0; $i<mysql_num_rows($result); $allrows[$i++] =
mysql_fetch_assoc($result));


$allrows would look like this for a result with 3 rows:
Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
        [firstcolname] => value of first col in FIRST row
        [secondcolname] => value of second col in FIRST row
        [thirdcolname] => value of third col in FIRST row        )    [1] =>
Array
        (
        [firstcolname] => value of first col in SECOND row
        [secondcolname] => value of second col in SECOND row
        [thirdcolname] => value of third col in SECOND row        )    [2]
=> Array        (        [firstcolname] => value of first col in THIRD row
[secondcolname] => value of second col in THIRD row        [thirdcolname] =>
value of third col in THIRD row        ))Of course, if you want to do
anything with the information, you can just put it within the for loop. This
works well for situations when you need to use the result later on or for
more than one thing.E.----- Original Message ----- From: "Chris Bielanski"

I am thick and tired of these elitist job postings.

Most people who are familiar with my work know I can accomplish pretty
anything. But again my resume would not even pass the small test in this
case.

Maybe the guy who wrote this didn't get the memo that php is relatively
easy language and that its no c++. Its also not so hard to create a web
base report from a database. Its not like you have to create complicated
statistical models.  There is absolutely nothing in this description
that would suggest that its nothing more then an entry-level position
form someone out of school.

Original post
--------------------------------------------
PHP/Web developer 

Right Media is seeking an experienced PHP developer/architect to join
its user interface/reporting team. 

All candidates MUST have significant professional experience developing
complex, database-driven PHP applications. This is a challenging
position and is not suitable for novice or entry-level programmers. As
the application uses a database backend and runs on Unix, experience
with SQL (MySQL experience is desirable) and Unix/Linux is required. 

The developer will be responsible for the creation of a web application
that displays complex, custom reports. Many of these reports are
financial, and will be used for accounting purposes. The developer must
have strong intrapersonal skills and be able to find the ideal way to
implement requirements in a clean, elegant way. Reusable code is
important, using object-oriented design where possible. Functional tests
will be written, where possible, to validate the correctness of the
code. 

Candidates should be able to provide examples of web applications and/or
frameworks that they have developed, to discuss practical and
theoretical consequences of design choices. 


Qualifications: 


*	Professional experience developing/architecting PHP-based web
applications 
*	SQL and a good knowledge of client-server architecture a must 
*	Web page design with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS 
*	Experience administrating Apache in a Unix environment is a plus

*	Proven experience designing browser-based GUIs, writing
usability tests, and incorporating user feedback 

This position is full-time in New York City, NY. This is not a
telecommute or contract position. Salary commensurate with experience.
Right Media is an equal opportunity employer. Email resumes and
questions to ekozek at rightmedia.com.

No, that part of the discussion happens when you negotiate your rate. 
The process is followed thusly:

THE ADVERTISEMENT

"The candidate must possess supernatural skills, be capable of working 
without sleep, have the complete software design processes mastered from 
requirements to maintenance, and be expert at programming, databases, 
and systems integration.  This project is critical for the success of 
the business, and the applicant must respond well to immense pressure to 
perform and very tight deadlines.  Required certifications are:  CISSP, 
MCSE, RHSE, and BYOL.  Applicant must also be a 47th-level blackbelt 
regarding security, and have a master's degree in something mostly 
relevant.  Methodologies required are RUP, MVC, PDQ, XYZ..."

THE COMPENSATION PLAN

"As this is a junior-level position with minimal strategic relevance in 
the day-to-day operations of the business, the job will be starting out 
at the rates applicable for an 18-year-old.  In about 10 years, if the 
company is still solvent and you haven't been relieved of your duties by 
one of the forty-seven mid-level managers that you will be reporting to, 
you may qualify for a possibly measurable raise."

Best laugh I've had all the afternoon, Thanks!

Actually I was already thinking about goofing on the standard
"interpersonal skills" bit you always see in job announcements. Here's one
I'd like to see:

The successful candidate will have extraordinarily poor interpersonal
skills, mumble and stare at her/his shoes during face to face
communication, not return email and voice mail messages, and not be a
motivated team player. Severe personality disorders, poor personal hygiene
a plus. Drug- and alcohol-dependent candidates preferred.

Maybe I should list all those skills on my resume just for the hell of
it ?

MySQL plans to announce a higher-end addition next month that will allow
more than one instance of its open-source database to take over if another
fails.

would be nice if the failover can completely eliminate the need for error
handling eh? j/k :-)

Felix, I don't know you personally so let me disagree with you in a 
friendly fashion.

This seems to be a job for a mature programmer, one who knows his or her 
own mistakes and doesn't take the easy way out or assume risks for 
speed. They mention database skills and financials; ergo any sloppy code 
or "quick fix" could enter bad data or leave sensitive info laying 
around in the open.

It is a growth item to be able to see the ramifications of your code and 
evaluate what you want to get done *and* what gets left around 
afterwards. And to rigorously test before deploying to critical business 
systems.

If they hired a junior person as lead for this I'd doubt the company 
would stay in business long, or keep the junior person.

ciao!

Message-ID: <D0D423C0-7750-11D8-A6E7-0003930D07F2@email.smith.edu>

Hi all,

I'm working up a little application that will require password 
authentication to gain entry into the site.  The login page will query 
the username/password information that is stored in a MySQL table.  I 
plan on using sessions to enable the authorized user to travel around 
the site and also to prevent an unauthorized user from gaining access 
to the site.

My main questions revolves around encryption.  The sources that I have 
been referencing advocate for encrypting the password during the 
authentication process.  However, I've been frustrated by how briefly 
this topic is passed over in my books.  The little application that I 
am working on now only has fairly low level security needs and 
encryption may be overkill, but I have another project coming down the 
line where the security needs will be greater, so I might as well get 
started learning this stuff now!  Like, one question I have is, why 
encrypt?  What am I preventing from happening?

In general I am interested in what methods of securing an application 
folks recommend.  I'd like to read up about general theories on 
protection and types of misuse/attacks as well as learn about specific 
methods of protection.  I'd also be interested in hearing references 
for good books that deal with security (shameless plugs are welcome).

The two methods I have seen recommended so far are:

1.  MySQL encryption via "password" function:
A preexisting script I inherited uses this method where the form 
submission is encrypted in the SQL query statement.
	"select * from tablename where name = '$_POST[name] and pass = 
password('$_POST['password'])";
So, the password is encrypted using MySQL's password encryption and is 
compared to the encrypted version stored in the table.  However, when I 
read the MySQL documentation, I came across these lines:
	"Note: The PASSWORD() function is used by the authentication system in 
MySQL Server, you should NOT use it in your own applications. For that 
purpose, use MD5() or SHA1() instead. Also see RFC-2195 for more 
information about handling passwords and authentication securely in 
your application."
So, it seems that this method is a no-no.

2.  Encrypt using php, which can use the available encryption methods 
which are available on the server operating system.  In the book that 
recommends using crypt() my issue is that it doesn't explain how it is 
working or what's going on behind the scenes and I haven't been able to 
find good documentation online that will help me either.  The crypt() 
code line in the book is:
	"if ( (crypt($password, $result[password])) == $result[password]) {  
// start session

I'd appreciate any feedback on the afore-mentioned methods, as well as 
book or online resource references.

Cheers,

-Aaron

Hi Dan ...

Thank you for posting the info (im on bugtraq and it gets crazy with
everything), normally I keep an eye on packages Im using, is there any way
(that you know of) to get alerts/emails pertaining to only those packages
(or linked packages?) ...

I have not seen anything like this ... I had been thinking that
site:securityfocus.com in a google news alert would work
(http://www.google.com/newsalerts) but it didn't.

Thoughts?

(Dan how do you keep tabs on security issues w/ Invision board for

Message-ID: <C92A8F8B60F96B42911EFA70AF30A88F060A4534@msp7-msx1.ingenix.com>

Hi list.  

BASIC: Apache 1.3.29, PHP 4.3.4, MySQL 4 on WIN2K-Pro
BACKGROUND: 
		Need to create multiple line graph (no x axis value but
multiple Y-axis values) using JPGRPAH.
PROBLEM:
		I have a table of fixed # of col. (6) with fixed # of rows
(6).  How do I get the data from MySQL and create one unique array for each
row (ea. row -> one new array -> plot for one line)

DATA EXAMPLE:
Category	val1	val2	VAL3
abc		89	78	99
efg		99	90	91
hij		100	99	90

Note: Trying to have abc, efg, hij as Y-axis separate data plot-in this case
I will have 3 arrays to create 3 lines on a graph.

Any help is absolutley appreciated! Heck I will even name the code and app
after you!

the best lesson you can give yourself is by downloading and firing up a free
packet analysis tool like Ethereal (www.ethereal.com) or my favorite
Packetyzer (http://www.networkchemistry.com/products/packetyzer/) and watch
what really happens between your client/browers and server/apache/php/mysql,
if somewhere along thoses lines you capture your own application password it
would be wise to think about starting to encrypt ...

Let me start by saying I am not a security expert, and therefore what
follows is just opinion based on my own 20 years of experience in
software development.

The purpose of encryption during the authentication process depends on
when in the process you are encrypting, and what your underlying application
structure is.

Back in the days of an application running on a standalone machine where
the password didn't transport over a network, the purpose was solely for
data security.  In today's applications where passwords are passing over
an insecure network you have the dual purpose of data security and
application
security.  If the password is encrypted on the client machine before it
is passed to the webserver, you are attempting to keep you application
secure
from net lurkers who may scoop up the uid/pw and then gain access to your
application as a valid user.  If the password is not encrypted until it is
on the
server you are fufilling data security.  If all the passwords are encrypted
in the
database, you provide an additional security in that anyone who may gain
access to the db does not automatically gain access to the ability to spoof
your valid users.  My own pet choice of encryption is a simple RC4
encryption
where I generate a few random characters + password + personal key as the
data stream, then encrypt this with the users password.  In this case, I
need
to be able to decrypt the password coming from the browser so that I can
attempt to decrypt the stored password.  On successful decryption of the
stored password the code can verify the success based on the password
portion of the plaintext matching the password used to decrypt.

The random characters serve to ensure that 2 users with the same password
do not generate the same ciphertext and thereby allow someone with db
access the ability to guess at a password based on visual patterns in the
cipher text between users.   The purpose of the personal key allows for
secure storage of a generated key for each user.  This key can then be used
to encrypt sensitive data that only the specified user may view.  Once again
the prying eyes of a db admin would not be able to view that sensitive data
because the key to decrypt is itself encrypted with a key with which the db
admin does not have access to.

The downside to the approach I just mentioned is that if the user forgets
their password, they must be issued a new password, the old password is
non-recoverable.  Any data encrypted with the personal key secured by the
old password is now also unrecoverable.  That is why when I need the added
security of personal keys and sensitive data encryption, I build an admin
store
which contains all the personal keys encrypted with the admin's key.  Access
to the data can still be lost, but it would happen only if the admin loses
access
to their personal key which happens much less often than a user losing a
key.

Once again remember, this is my own design and is not based on years of
experience in security, but in application development.  So far I have never
had
a breach that I have been made aware of, now weather that is luck, or luck
in
a good design, I couldn't tell ya'.

For login purposes, I have people log in through SSL and have their 
passwords encrypted using "crypt." Crypt does a one-way encryption so 
you encrypt their password that they input on the form and compare it to 
what's stored in the database. (Basically no. 2 in your list.)

If someone should somehow gain access to the database or some other 
catastrophe might occur, they'd see something like the following in your 
table's password field: LSoxL6eUJCUYg. (Of course, if someone gained 
access to your database...you've got bigger issues to handle.)

You could do something like this

$q = "select * from table_name";
$result = mysql_query($q);

$table_rows = array ();  //array of arrays
$cont = 0;  //counter

while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){
	$table_rows [$cont] = $row;   //adds the array to the array
	$cont++;   //increment the counter
}


After this $table_rows will be an array of arrays. The while structure adds an 
array ($row) for each row in your table (table_name).

You can get the values with a for{} structure if you wish.

Hope this helps,
Henry

If im not mistaken tcpdump should come w/ OS X ... try typing "which
tcpdump" in command line to see what you get, there are frontends, google
for "MacSniffer" or if your daring + have time to kill try to compile
ettercap for Mac (http://ettercap.sourceforge.net/) as it will provide you
with more security testing tools than you will ever need ...

typing "which tcpdump" on command line returns:
/usr/sbin/tcpdump
Which I'm guessing indicates that tcpdump is installed and available.

I found MacSniffer on version tracker.  Sweet, thanks!

OK, so:

1.  SSL protects the data from being sniffed out as it goes from the 
form on the client machine to the server.  This seems to be the only 
way, or at least the best way to prevent the data from being 
transmitted in the clear?
2.  When you crypt their password to compare it to the one stored in 
the database, and it's a one way encryption, that means that the 
password stored in your database has been put in via crypt as well at 
some point, correct?

Encrypting on the client machine is best done with SSL?

Maybe someone has some experience with this....
Anyone have a clue why Apache would spawn 2 processes of the same
CGI script from a single HTTP request?  I checked the CGI script and
there is no fork() so it's not that.  What else could it be?
 
Help is appreciated, thxs!

Aaron-

As a fellow mac guy, I?ve had good luck with Apple?s X11 application and
Ethereal. I believe I installed ethereal via Fink, which was a snap, and X11
is a free download from apple.

You're correct about what SSL does. However, another way to prevent the 
data from being transmitted in the clear is to encrypt it (with 
Javascript) before it is sent to the server.

http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/ has some links and demos of encryption 
with Javascript.

With this method, the data passes in the clear to the server, but a 
sniffer sees the encrypted version of the password instead of the real 
password.

The downsides of this method:
  - the user must have Javascript turned on
  - a sniffer could capture the entire session and replay it
    to pretend to be a valid user

To prevent the capture and replay, you'd need to put something *else* in 
the form that is unique each time you present the log in form. That way, 
if you see a duplicate on the server, you know that it's an invalid form 
submission.

If you (or your ISP) can flip a switch and enable SSL on your server, 
it's simpler (no changes required in your pages) and more standard. If 
for some reason you can't use SSL, all this Javascript whatnot can be 
helpful.

Yes. The logic in your account signup page might look something like

if (form_is_submitted() && form_data_is_valid()) {
     $encrypted_password = crypt($_POST['password']);
     db_query("INSERT INTO users (username,password) VALUES 
('$_POST[username]','$encrypted_password');
     print "You're all signed up now.";
  }

Yes.  The only other success I have had is using a JavaScript to
encrypt the pw & place in the pw field.  The problem with this is ...
JavaScript.

Your welcome.

Let me make it simpler through example.

Credit Cards many times need to be stored, but the User gets a warm fuzzy
if they know that their card data is encrypted in a way that can only be
accessed
by them.  If on creating the user I generate a random alphanumeric string, I
can
use this string to encrypt the credit card data.  The only problem is how do
I
store the random string in a way that can only be used by the user
associated with
the card?  That is why I post pend it onto the users password prior to
encrypting
the password.  Since only the user should have their password, only the user
can decrypt the random string key, and therefore only the user can decrypt
their
credit card data.  In reality, you can achieve the same thing if you use the
users password, preferably in plaintext as the key to encrypting data like
CC's,
but the random generated string adds an extra layer of protection.  If you
were to
use the ciphertext version of the password( ie. what is saved in your user
table )
the CC data can be decrypted via a scan of the users, decrypting the cc data
with
each users ciphertext password until the CC data decrypts to something that
makes
sense.

The Random characters I prepend to the password before encryption and
storage is
due to the encryption (RC4).  RC4 generates the same ciphertext given the
same
plaintext/key.  If I have 2 users with the password 'password', even though
I am post
pending the randomly generated string to use as a personal key, the 1st 8
characters
of my plaintext will be the same and will therefore generate the same 1st 8
characters
of ciphertext.  If I know that the 1st 3 characters are random in the
plaintext, I can
be reasonably assured that there will be no discernable patterns in the
stored ciphertext.

Finally, my choice of RC4 is due to it's simplicity in implementing yourself
while providing
a reasonable amount of security.  Many languages now also have RC4 built in.
I don't
know if PHP does since I had RC4 already written in VBScript so it was an
easy port to
PHP and I still use my own implementation.

I can imagine.  Getting the weekly summary, which is what I do, seems a
handy way to reduce that clutter.

If you want a more timely alert for specific packages, one could subscribe 
to bugtraq and run the incomming emails throug procmail (or some other 
filtering mechanism).  If the item's subject matches your criteria, pass 
it along.  If not, dump it.  Crude, but it'll generally work.

I'm hopeful that my IT dept. will be able to flip the switch on SSL, if 
they haven't already.

I've really moved away from JavaScript for the express reason of the 
unpredictability of the user having it on or off.  That's good info 
though, as a backup to the SSL option.  Thanks!

This sort of begs the question, what IS JavaScript good for, besides 
perhaps image rollovers...  =)

Maybe someone has some experience with this....
Anyone have a clue why Apache would spawn 2 processes of the same
CGI script from a single HTTP request?  I checked the CGI script and
there is no fork() so it's not that.  What else could it be?
 
Help is appreciated, thxs!

This is probably because they recommend storing the digest of the password
in the database, so that you must compare the digest of what the user
enters to authenticate him/her.

For example:

1. User registers for an account:
   username: myuser
   password: mypass
2. You perform md5($password) to get a029d0df84eb5549c641e04a9ef389e5.
3. You store the account in the database:
   username: myuser
   password: a029d0df84eb5549c641e04a9ef389e5

So, when you authenticate:

4. A user wants to login as myuser and provides mypass as the password.
5. You compare a029d0df84eb5549c641e04a9ef389e5 (what's in the database)
   with the md5 of what the user entered to validate the credentials.

Encryption is a helpful thing when it comes to security, but only if you
understand how it's helping. Just randomly throwing encryption into the
mix rarely does you any good.

An example (I think David mentioned this) is a replay attack, and I can
give a hypothetical (but quite common) example.

Some people have this strange idea that they should reauthenticate the
user every visit instead of using sessions to track the user's state. So,
to be safe, they store the user's username and password in a cookie (or a
couple of cookies), and they encrypt the username, password, both, or some
cool string they think of that also contains secret words. They may end up
with one crazy looking cookie:

mycookie=q234c5?R~@r451xc3C%!R3ctr512%T%C

"That's GOTTA be secure," they think to themselves. Keep in mind that they
are authenticating on every visit, so this cookie doesn't require an
active session or anything. Now, imagine that a poor user uses IE (users
don't know any better), and their cookie gets exposed to whomever wants
it. Now, a bad guy visits the site with:

mycookie=q234c5?R~@r451xc3C%!R3ctr512%T%C

Oops, not only did the bad guy just impersonate the poor IE user, the bad
guy can do this anytime he/she wants. There's no need to even bother
capturing this cookie ever again. Good thing it's encrypted, huh? :-)

> Like, one question I have is, why encrypt? What am I preventing from
> happening?

Exposure. People often use sniffing as an example of what bad things can
happen from exposure, but it's really just one example (and there's no
need to brainstorm examples, since they're irrelevant in terms of
determining whether exposure is bad). For any bit of data within your
application, you want to keep up with:

1. Where the data is kept, where it travels, etc. Know your data.
2. Whether it *really* matters if the data is captured by a bad guy.

For example, if your session mechanism is session_start() and nothing
else, it does matter if the session identifier is captured. For a lot of
data, it probably doesn't really matter, so exposure isn't a big deal. The
worst that can happen from exposure is that the data is captured by a bad
guy, so don't bother worrying about how the bad guy does it (unless you're
just curious).

I hope to have a shameless plug later this year. :-)

I do have a monthly column in php|architect called Security Corner, and
you can find a few articles on my Web site:

http://shiflett.org/articles

> 1.  MySQL encryption via "password" function:

MySQL's password function is version-specific, so this can be a problem. I
think it's 4.1 where it changes, but maybe it's 5.0.

crypt() is DES, and you might be interested in this book:

Hi Rafi:

Henry's answer expands upon the answer I gave you the other day on your 
related question.  Henry's change to accommodate your new question is to 
create an array of an array for each row.  His code can be simplified a 
tad as well by dropping the $cont counter variable since PHP automatically 
assigns the keys...

$table_rows = array ();
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
    $table_rows[] = $row;
}

That could even be cut down a step by assigning the data directly...

$table_rows = array ();
while ($table_rows[] = mysql_fetch_array($result));

Honestly, you got me there, I'm not sure what SALT is unless your
talking the condiment.  My random alphanumeric string is to be used
as a key for encryption of other data in the system.  If your only need
is to encrypt the user passwords, then this random alphanumeric
string is of no benefit to you.

Hehe, tho' it is getting to be time for lunch I'm not referring to the 
condiment.

 From php.net, in reference to crypt:
string crypt ( string str [, string salt])
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php

My impression is that the salt is the string that you can provide to 
enable the encryption.  In the case of crypt, if you don't provide one, 
one will be provided for you.

Perhaps this isn't analogous to your RC4 method, as you are prepending 
the random string to the end of the the password and then encrypting...

Crypt uses a "salt."

A salt can alter an algorithm, such as DES, to make it a bit less
predictable. In fact, using a salt allows for 4096 variations of the DES
algorithm.

What you're describing sounds like a symmetric key.

Ah, so that is SALT.  I don't use DES nor crypt since I use my own
implementation of RC4.

> Perhaps this isn't analogous to your RC4 method, as you are prepending
> the random string to the end of the the password and then encrypting...
RC4 is a simple stream permutation/substitution cipher. There are only 2
things you need for encryption, the plaintext/data to encrypt and a key. In
my
case, the plaintext is a few random characters + the password + a random
generated string to use as a key for encrypting other data.  If I don't need
the personal encryption then my plaintext is a few random characters + the
password.  The key I use for encryption is the users password.  Validation
is simply decrypting the stored ciphertext using the users plaintext
password.
If I know I used 3 random characters then I start reading the decrypted data
starting at position 3 and compare to the plaintext password, if it matches
character for character, I know the password is valid.  If the personal
encryption
is used, then anything after the password in the decrypted data is the key
for personal encryption, this is stored as a session variable so any pages
which need to use personal encryption has access to this additional key.

With all that said, and my initial impression of SALT in DES, then no,
SALT does not provide the same functionality as my random prepended
data. At least not in the same way.  SALT looks more like Key data since
crypt is using DES for HASH generation & DES is not that I am aware of
a HASH algo, but an encryption algo.  The difference in an encrypt and a
HASH is in the results.  Encryption is a two way process where the
ciphertext can be turned back into the plaintext with the proper inputs.  In
the case of RC4, you encrypt with plaintext and a key, you decrypt with
ciphertext and the same key you encrypted with.  A HASH function on the
other hand generates a mathematical identifier which cannot be turned back
into the original plaintext and is therefore oneway.  I personally like to
view
a hash as similar to a checksum.  The resulting HASH can be the same
as the resulting HASH for other data, so the HASH is not unique to the
HASH'ed data.  Depending on the HASH algo determines how likely it
is for another dataset to result in the same HASH.  It is because of this
potential for another set of data to generate the same HASH I personally
don't like to use HASH's for security.  I'm sure it's an irational fear on
my

Message-ID: <200403161326.21074.sunny-ml@opencurve.org>

Hi guys

(this was also posted to nylug-talk, sorry for those on both lists!)

I need some web-software that does the following things:

- Allows users to upload files
- Allows those users to have the software email other people with links 
pointing to the uploaded files:

The following is an example email the software would generate and send to 
someone:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
To:   someone at somewhere.com
From;  file-share at company.com

Subject:  Employee has sent you a file!!

Message Body:
Here are the documents

https://company.com/getfile.php?=9w8c94ur8ujklo3iqrj4jlq3nrtf6w
(link is only valid for 3 days)

EOF
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been using bytehoard, but it has some pretty strange bugs, and doesn't 
work with postfix2.x too well.  So I'm looking for something new.

I don't have an issue paying a resonable price.  Though I'm not going deny 
I'd like to purchase a pre-existing solution (it would be cheaper).

On the subject of SSL, has anyone ever dealt with freecert.org, or
similarly alternative certificate authorities? I'm trying to find out if
there's any middle ground between a full cost certificate from Thawte or
Verisign and a self-signed certificate that no one else but me will
trust.

 From the brief reading I have done so far on crypt() and md5() I'm not 
clear about the distinctions between the two.  Looks like I need to 
read some more, but would appreciate any pointers on that topic.

I've looked around too, but everything is either a) a simple file manager or 
b) has one too many features.

I'm somewhat surprised that the software I spoke about isn't made by 
billions of people.  I say this because the clothing industry lives on such 
software.

WIth the clothing industry, you have to deal with people in different 
countries pretty much all the time.  So shipping samples back and forth is 
really really slow.  So these guys scan *clothing* at real size with a 
billion dots per square inch.  Additionally since none of them know much 
about photoshop, they all end up with huge 20-30 meg JPEG files.  These 
files need to be traded back an forth on a regular basis, hence the need 
for such software.  (Emailing realy huge files back and forth isn't too 
possible for most.)

I'd like to have something asap.  So for the time being I'll hash out 
something simple with either bashlib or c++ (you can stop laughing now!).  
My html/xml/css/php/mysql/etc/etc/etc is pretty dismal, heh.

Thanks for the help though!

PS:  sorry if this post screws up the threading, my email client had some

I have to add a chat area in my site. I've been reading info on this and I see 
that there's different approaches.

The two approaches to get this done that most interest me are:
php and an ircd on my server
php/msyql (similar to phplive!)

Can you give me your opinion on which is best, based on your past experience, 
other's past experience, etc.??

Thank you.

Don't forget option #3, remote flash with textfiles on the server.  If 
you are interested I will hunt down that link, I was meaning to build 
something with it for another site as a proof of concept...

Actually quite brilliant, as the flash 'animation' basically polls the 
textfile for changes every xxx seconds, and all 'posts' get appended to 
the textfile. No database overhead, and very small footprint on the client.

Option 4 is much more like an actual chat client.

Php sockets with xml_sockets in flash.

Wrote one a little over ayear ago, which doesn't seem to work anymore due ot
lack of maintainence.  I've wanted to get it back up and running, just no
time.  I know there's someone else on this board who's working on one.  I
wrote him a full step by step breakdown of how I implemented it if you're
interested.

Good luck.

The affiliate programs use a technique that allow a merchant to create a
banner link say:

<a href="http://aff/index.php?id=[affiliate_id]">
<img src="http://aff/image.php?id=[affiliate_id]">
</a>

Then use the tracking affiliate id for both the session and store it for
later on to apply a % of the sales to the referrer ...

You could really do the same thing ... log it to MySQL and redirect the
user:

<a href="http://example.com/link.php?id=123&ref=456">link</a>

$link_id = $_POST['id']; $referral_id = $_POST['ref'];
// log, increment counter, grab link, etc.
header("Location: [what 123 points to]");
exit;

El-cheapo affiliate program :-)

Jon:
When trying to decide this for myself, I read a few really really
negative reviews, which all basically said that core 1 wasn't ready
for primetime.  I forget now where I saw them; maybe distrowatch,
maybe linuxnews.  I have yet to find a positive review.

I'm highly biasd in favor of Red Hat, so take this with a grain of salt. 
Maybe a couple deer licks worth...

Fedora is RH9 with more stuff, and it is the current development area of 
Red Hat and their influence on the Linux community. RH9 will no longer 
be supported after April. If your machine runs well and you don't need 
the most current stuff then you can safely stay with 9 as long as your 
box isn't exposed to the world.

I do my development on a Fedora box, but I also have a RHEL WS desktop. 
Since I'm primarily a sysadmin any problems with the OS are my stock in 
trade. If you're more a developer and don't want to spend your time on 
the OS, just stay where you are. There's not a lot of binary 
incompatibility from RH9 -> FC1/2, as far as I understand it for PHP/MySQL.

I've not hit any showstoppers with it except the Nvidia video card, the 
MySQL license issue which kept the distributed version on 3.23, and 
bandwidth issues if you're trying to upgrade when everyone else is.

FC2 is due out soon and will use the 2.6 kernel. May also have a more 
current MySQL too.

Hope that helps.

ciao!

Seriously, I'd love to document something like this, as it is becoming

Here it is ;)

I had RH9 running on my workstation at home, and have to admin a mix of 
7.X/8.X/FC1 servers all over the world.

Out of sheer curiosity I did a fresh install of FC1 on my workstation, 
and have been happy ever since.  Getting new versions of package-xyz was 
never easier (or available), and I have not experienced any stability 
issues - in fact am much happier with FC1.

FC2 is around the corner, and I contemplated installing a test release, 
but chickened out - I'll wait a little longer for the new kernel stuff 
to get ironed out.

I consider linux distros just like cell phones, right when you make up 
your mind on what you want, another one is announced, prolonging your 
purchasing paralysis :)

Damn.. I seem to have lost the actual doc I wrote a while back.   I've been

finishing the app.

I'll get to writing now.. Hopefully I'll have something for ya by this

I and several freinds have upgraded to FC1 and we have no complaints.
On my Dell 5000e laptop, everything got configured properly and I
upgraded to the latest releases easily with YUM.

I can't find anything wrong with it.  When I get some time, I'll
probably upgrade all of my home machnes to FC1.  I'll probably buy RH
Enterprise WS and/or Server just to see what they're about.

Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F9033C7A436@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

Does anyone have a good idea of the best way to handle HTML entities in post
variables?  It seems that the entity will be converted to a rendered
character when the page returns making checks of the string used to set the
value against the returned (posted) value will fail.

For example

// &#146; is the close quote

$a='Yes, It&#146;s true';

echo '<input type="radio" name="q1" value="'.$a.'">'.$a;

.
.
.

if ($a==$_post['q1']) {
	echo 'A miracle happened';

}

Checking $_post['q1'], I find it is equal to "Yes it's true"
I have played around with other entities and it doesn't seem to be an issue
with just  quotes.

Does anyone have an idea of why this is happening and, perhaps, the best way
to handle this?  

I believe a similar question was posted back on the 2nd by Rahmin, but I
couldn't find any responses.  

Mike

Check the manual for the htmlspecialchars(), urlencode() and urldecode()
functions. Unless I'm missing the point, these functions should make it
fairly simple for you to convert the entities or encoding in the request
vars back into plaintext. If that's not helpful, Read The Fine Manual about
string data, and the differences in single- and double-quoted string
contructs, particularly where it concerns using the backslash character to
escape other characters within a string.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] HTML entities in posted variables problem
Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F9033C7A466@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

Chris,

Thank you very much. urlencode/urldecode works. It never occured to me to
use this technique with the POST method, but it works and solves this issue
of getting back exactly what you preset a form variable to be.

Interestingly, htmlentities doesn't seem to work for me as 

htmlentities($a) is not equal to htmlentities($_post['q1']) 

It seems like it should work (as all characters with entity equivalents
should be translated), but it doesn't for me even exploring the various
quoting options of this function.

My issue is that I have no idea of what people are going to put into the $a
string.  It may contain entities or not.  All I need to know is if I got
back the exact same string after posting which is where I ran into this
issue.

On a side note,It also seems to me that the "text" form elements are going
to present special issues like the one mentioned by Rahmin since you are not
dealing with preset values.  

Thanks again for your help.

Mike

This is probably because htmlentities() turns " into &quot; and not 
&#146;  &#146; (on my browser at least) displays as a curly apostrophe 
(single close quote), not as a doublequote.

Add to that, there's always the chance that you will get UTF-8 when you want
ASCII, or vice-versa... Clients are funny things.

Ok, I kinda threw something together.  A forewarning.  This is NOT a
tutorial.  It's mostly a story of the process I went through.  I've included
a few code excerpts as well.  I plan to eventually write out the entire
process and offer some code and all that fun stuff, but I don't have any
time to get  that together now.

http://www.enobrev.com/chat_tutorial.php 

Feel free to contact me off list should you have any questions or
corrections.  I will NOT give out the code at them moment.  Not that I don't
want to share, the code is in pieces and is not ready for anything even
remotely resembling distribution.

Enjoy.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] need urgent help with MySQL indexing problem
Message-ID: <4058842E.4010202@adnet-sys.com>

The following occurs when we query records on the 'interns' table:

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to 
allocate 40 bytes) in ../intern.inc on line 1135

We are having a live problem inasmuch as the client is attempting now to 
search and query records only to have such error messages occur at this 
point.  The table consists of currently approx. 2000 records only, MySQL 
3.23.41.

Any advice appreciated and quickly!

Thanx
Phil

Hmm, wonder if urlencode() and urldecode() would do the trick?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [ANNOUNCE] Roadsend Compiler for PHP Public Beta
Message-ID: <4058911D.8050505@roadsend.com>


Roadsend is pleased to announce the immediate availability of a
limited beta test program for the Roadsend Compiler for PHP.

The Roadsend Compiler for PHP generates standalone applications,
libraries, and web applications from standard PHP source code. The
compiler produces native machine code, not PHP byte code, so no
interpreter is required.  The code generated by the compiler is
optimized to improve performance.

The Roadsend Compiler for PHP is a *new* implementation of the PHP
language and runtime environment compatible with Zend PHP 4.3.4. The
Roadsend Compiler for PHP does not share any source code with the open
source PHP implementation.

We are now accepting applications to participate in the beta test.  By
taking part in the beta test you can help shape the compiler before
its public release by suggesting improvements and reporting bugs.

Applicants should have a good working knowledge of PHP, a current base
of code they can use for testing, and good bug reporting and
communication skills.

For more information, or to apply for the program, please visit the
Roadsend website at http://www.roadsend.com

Thank You,
Roadsend Staff

Actually the client is saying it sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't 
happen, and when they refresh their screen it clears itself (I assume 
the memory clears).

Here is line 1135:
[PHP]$result = mysql_query($this->query, $this->dbcnx) or 
die(@include("$DOCUMENT_ROOT${devpath}errors/query_error.php"));[/PHP]

It is found here in this class method:

class mySqlQuery {

    var $query,$dbcnx; // $dbcnx is a mySqlConnection object   

    function mySqlQuery($query,$dbcnx) {
        $this->query = $query;
        $this->dbcnx = $dbcnx;
    }

    function runQuery() {
        global $devpath,$DOCUMENT_ROOT;   
        if (preg_match('/development\//i', $devpath)) {
         $result = mysql_query($this->query, $this->dbcnx) or 
die(@include("$DOCUMENT_ROOT${devpath}errors/query_error.php?msg=" . 
urlencode(mysql_error())));
        } else {
         $result = mysql_query($this->query, $this->dbcnx) or 
die(@include("$DOCUMENT_ROOT${devpath}errors/query_error.php"));
        }
        return $result;
    }


    function getResult() {
        $runquery = $this->runQuery();
        $count = 0;
        while ($row = mysql_fetch_object($runquery)) {
            $result[$count] = $row;
            $count++;
        }
        return $result;
    }
 
    function getRows($what = 'select') {
        $runquery = $this->runQuery();
        $count = 0;

        if (strcmp(strtolower($what), 'affected') == 0) {
            $row = @mysql_affected_rows($this->dbcnx);
         } else {
                 $row = @mysql_num_rows($this->dbcnx);
         }

        if (!$row) {
            return false;
        }

        return $row;
    }

    function freeResult() {
        @mysql_free_result($this->runQuery());
    }

}

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Recommendations for fine-tuning FULLTEXT search
	indexing MySQL 3.23.41
Message-ID: <4058928B.2040904@adnet-sys.com>

Consider the following query:

SELECT id, CONCAT(lname,', ',fname,' ',mi) as 
name,citizen,major,minor,gpa,internship_eo, MATCH 
(fname,lname,email,enrollment_status,enrollment_type,enrollment_year,major,minor,agencies,internship_eo,internship_sponsors,activities,reasons,resume) 
AGAINST ('Computer') as score FROM interns WHERE MATCH 
(fname,lname,email,enrollment_status,enrollment_type,enrollment_year,major,minor,agencies,internship_eo,internship_sponsors,activities,reasons,resume) 
AGAINST ('Computer')

If I run this query I get 0 results back, however, I can easily verify 
by peeking into the database that at least one of the columns in MATCH() 
for at least 1 record contains the word 'Computer'.

If I use this query instead:

SELECT id, CONCAT(lname,', ',fname,' ',mi) as 
name,citizen,major,minor,gpa,internship_eo, MATCH 
(fname,lname,email,enrollment_status,enrollment_type,enrollment_year,major,minor,agencies,internship_eo,internship_sponsors,activities,reasons,resume) 
AGAINST ('Computers') as score FROM interns WHERE MATCH 
(fname,lname,email,enrollment_status,enrollment_type,enrollment_year,major,minor,agencies,internship_eo,internship_sponsors,activities,reasons,resume) 
AGAINST ('Computers')

I get results coming back, even from those where none of the columns in 
the MATCH() contain the word 'Computers' (but contain the word 'Computer').

If anyone has ever worked with MySQL 3.23.41 MyISAM tables with FULLTEXT 
search indexes, please let me know how I can fine-tune this to function 
properly upon a search word(s).

Thanx
Phil

What you just posted has nothing to do with the reason you're gobbling up
all of the memory.  But why am I not surprised.

... I deleted the text from prior posts.  You DO know there's a DELETE key
on your keyboard, right?  Select the old text then hit that key.  Good

No, that's not it Phil.  How CAN we help you if you don't post the
information relevant to your problems?  And then when we FINALLY figure it
out -- after dragging it out of you -- and tell you what to do, you go
ahead and ignore what we say?

Tell you what, Dan.  Tell me EXACTLY what I must post for you to know 
what illustrates the problem.  Hans asked for the code that threw the 
Fatal Error, which is what I did.. and the script that has the line that 
throws the fatal error.  I don't understand what you want, then. 
 Perhaps, again, I don't know how to communicate to NYPHP people, or at 
least to you.  And I do not ignore people's advice, that is a serious 
overgeneralization.  As a matter of fact I am quick to thank others for 
their help, and many times I solve it beforehand and listen to their 
advice.  But I do not listen to personal attacks and spiteful diatribe 
only because the client problem is unsolved ultimately by such an 
exchange (and my level of respect toward the spiter is lowered only 
because I am concluding they are unwilling to "share the wealth" of 
personal experience in dealing with a similar area out of whatever 
personal reasons abound).

hey there:

i am having one of those 'feeling stupid' moments, but i have a 
search and replace that is for some reason working on my home machine 
and failing on my remote server.

i need to match everything inside a <sup> html tag, even if that 
includes other html tags, and replace it with something else.  here's 
my call:

---
$fn_text_to_match = '|<sup class="gt_article_footnote">([^</sup>]+)</sup>|';
$art_body_real = preg_replace_callback( 
$fn_text_to_match,'handleFootnote',$art_body );

the function handleFootnote, does this:

$all_footnotes = array();
function handleFootnote( $matches ){
	global $fn_ctr, $all_footnotes, $art_id;

	//echo "we found a match: " . $fn_ctr . " | " . $matches[1] . "<br />";
	$all_footnotes[$fn_ctr] = array(
		"text" => $matches[1]
	);

	$fn_ctr++;

	return '<sup class="gt_article_footnote"><a 
href="javascript:showGTFootnotes(' . "'" . $fn_ctr . "'" . ')">' . 
($fn_ctr+1) . '</a></sup>';
}
---

Basically, what's going on here, is the client has a tool where they 
can enter text in superscript, then i need to parse that text out and 
replace it with a number, and extract the text they had as a 
'footnote' which is exported to a text file.

But the problem with my original match is i need to match the <sup 
class="gt_article_footnote">...</sup>

can anyone help me with that first line of code there?  i am not the 
most experienced with regular expressions...

cheers,

The regular expression '|<sup 
class="gt_article_footnote">([^</sup>]+)</sup>|'

Says

"match the literal text '<sup class="gt_article_footnote">' then one or 
more characters that aren't <, /, s, u, p, or >, then the literal text 
'</sup>'"

You want

{<sup class="gt_article_footnote">(.+?)</sup>}

which says "match the literal text '<sup class="gt_article_footnote">' 
then as few characters as possible, then the literal text '</sup>'

(I also changed the delimiters to curly braces to avoid confusion with 
the | regex metacharacter.)

This regex still puts the stuff inside the <sup></sup> tags in $matches[1].

Actually, some of the queries could be producing Cartesian products, but 
there are those that simply have this:

SELECT id, fname, lname, gpa, major, minor FROM interns ORDER BY lname, 
date desc

For queries such as these (this is one of the queries that has on 
occasions thrown the Fatal Error upon attempt to use mysql_query() upon 
this statement (occurs in about 5 different scripts now).

I'm no guru so maybe I missed something but -- it looks like the regex
assumes all the stuff will be on a single line. If you want to allow the
possibility that there are newlines between <sup> and </sup>, add the s
modifier.

Right?

seems the query as indicated above, would not yield a CP, since 
it's only a single table... I notice you're ordering by some 
columns that are not in the requested list of fields you want 
returned... if you can duplicate it, either try eliminating the 
date and desc in the ORDER BY clause or include them in the 
SELECTED field list...

doing this may lead to some further insights...


however, have you thought of the possibility that

Yes, you're correct. Good catch! /s (or '}s' in this case) is required 
to make "." match newlines as well as any other character.

Glad it made some semblance of sense to you.

I've loved the potential of flash for a long time now, but now... Wow.  In
the past week with it, my oo 'get it' meter has gone from 'huh?' to
'ahhhh!!'.  I'm in love all over again. That's one of the reasons I spit
this this thing out.. a motivator to getting back on track...

many thanks.  i was trying in my head to create a match for the 
beginning of the tag, then anything that is not "</sup>", and then 
</sup>.

many times, like now, i find that my strategy is wrong with pattern matching.

Thinking like a regex would is a weird way to think that requires a lot 
of adjustment from normal human thought.

The adjustment, IMHO, is complicated when you want to express a negation 
in your pattern (like "anything that is not '</sup>') because the ways 
to do that in regex land are tucked into twisty, punctuation-riddled 
back alleys.

"Mastering Regular Expressions" by Jeffrey Friedl (http://regex.info) is 
  the place to start if you want to climb the regex mountain, though.

Now I have to steer this in a different direction.

The change in pattern works fine on my PowerBook (I have virtual 
domains set up on my account, so it behaves through the browser just 
as it would live).

However, it doesn't work on the remote machine...the change doesn't 
happen.  The remote server is a Linux shared server environment which 
I am familiar with, and normally I don't have these kinds of gotchas 
(I have like 9 domains hosted there).

Does anyone have any insight as to what could be the difference 
between my local setup and the remote one, with respect to the 
preg_replace_callback() function?

Both machines are above 4.3, so the function certainly ought to be 
available, and would be throwing an error if it weren't.

?? confused.

OK guys, I got spoiled.  I read a very kewl article a while back at Dev Shed about how to build a Document Management open source tool (check it out: http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Cracking-The-Vault-%28part-1%29).

Simply a document repository that will allow you to check docs in and out for changing, read only access for most folk, and some basic version control.
 
I think only Word, Excel, PDF and Project files will be involved... mostly Word Docs.
 
Anything out there I can buy cheaply and modify in-house? (they need it yesterday... and it's much easier to get hours from them than ODC charges).
 
I know we speak mostly PHP here (hence the title of the listserv).  However, you folks have ALWAYS had great ideas in the past....

Ahh.. it WAS a Cartesian product in the long run.. I found this one 
buried query somewhere in the mountain of code that pulls up a few other 
list pages (pages of lists of interns) and the query indeed pulls a 
Cartesian product (including in one instance a boatload of empty rows to 
display on the screen).. thanx for your help!

Out of curiosity, why must it be in CF?  And for that matter, why
Access?  PHP/Oracle would be a nice combo, but CF/Access... eek.

Sorry though; don't know of anything that would do this in the CF world,
although there's certainly some commercial packages I'm sure.  That
said, just code it in PHP and have the parser parse .cfm as .php  :)

Indeed. I finally bought it -- it must be one of the most widely
recommended computer books of all time -- and it's superb. Problem is I'm
trying to use it as a bathroom book. Unfortunately -- or perhaps,
fortunately, depending on your POV -- I don't spend long enough periods of
time in there to give the book the sustained attention it requires and
deserves.

OK, I have figured out that my problem is a difference in

I see.  Then there's some other reason you decided to send (as ususal)  
that huge chunk of SQL object code rather than what Hans asked for: "Show
me line 1135 and a couple lines surrounding it."  And there must be some
metaphysical reason you're compelled to continually fail to snip prior
postings.

I too am wringing my hands over what to do post-RH9. I wonder:  wouldn't
it be possible to stay with RH9 indefinitely and keep it up to date using
one of those tools other than up2date?

Meanwhile I've also looked at some Fedora reviews. Most have been
positive. That would seem the most logical successor. But I am also
thinking about giving Mandrake another shot -- I tried 9.x but it had

Alas, you never know how it's gonna work out on your machine until you try
it. Too bad we don't have a couple weeks to spend just playing with
distros.

I'd stay away from it personally; some others on this list could attest,
too.

Stick with Fedora/Redhat; solid distro.  Or, go with FreeBSD, which is
what gentoo wants to be.

Without about Debian? It is the best distro I have ever used, and I 
have played with most of the major ones.  The install can be a 
challenge (at first) but once installed, forget about it. Apt-Get 
rocks.

If you want a commercial entity behind it check out Xandros, although I 
think it is aimed at the desktop.

Gentoo is nice but as far as production seems a bear to keep updated. 
There is probably a way around this but spending hours or days to 
update a server seems a bit much,

I decided to bail on RH because I didn't like the direction things were
going with Fedora.
It's good to know that those who have commented here on using it have had
a positive experience, but the way that RH described it, to me at least,
sold it as potentially unreliable and nothing more than a kicker to get
you to buy enterprise.

I tried Gentoo, but I couldn't get it to install to my satisfaction.
Perhaps I wasn't patient enough for it (so many options and things don't
seem to be autodetected [good?/bad?]), or have I been too pampered by RH's
and Mandrake's nice GUI (or TUI) installers?

My new distro of choice is knoppix (knoppix.net).

It's all on ONE CD, not 7 or 9 or whatever and you can boot from the CD to
a well equipped KDE desktop from which you can test your HW compatibility
before you do a full install. (Admission: I couldn't get it to 100% pick
up the on-board ethernet on a HP laptop I bought, but I took a little leap
of faith and it worked).

What you get with an install is Debian all set up and ready to go with
KDE, OO 1.1, Gimp, etc, etc, etc...

It's taking me a little while to get used to KDE (from GNOME), but you can
put GNOME on if you want.

For updates, use apt-get.
Install more packages? apt-get

Now, just install XAMPP and in under an hour you can have a nice new LAMP
server.

Maybe this isn't bleeding-edge enough for some, like I think Fedora is
supposed to be, but it's easy and it works.

I use gentoo on my work station, and I really like it. The portage 
system makes it easy to stay up to date, although you do burn a lot of 
time compiling. I've run into only a couple of problems with the portage 
build system - everything so far has pretty much "just worked".  When I 
first tried it I imagined wasting hours figuring out why packages 
weren't building right, but this hasn't been the case at all.

One of the things I like over other distros is I don't have to worry 
about upgrading to the inevitable next release or finding the latest 
version of a package, which always seems to be a hassle. Just stay up to 
date periodically with 'emerge -u world' and I'm always on the latest 
release.

I haven't used gentoo on a server yet (we still use debian), but I'm 
considering it with my success so far on the work station...

Very good point.  It's often overlooked (in the US anyway), but arguably
the best distro out there.

Understood, Hans.  My issue is that it will be an additional development on a customer's existing box.  And that box contains other products that are utilizing CF and MS or Oracle db products.  I also do not control the loading of software on the box... so I can't utilize a PHP/MySQL combo on the existing box.
SO... this time round I had no choice.
 
Thanks for the input though.  I know this isn't a CF list... but we all seem to have such a wide ranging skill set that no search is complete without bouncing it off the list.
 
Hope everyone is having a great week....

i second that, this is a great tool that when it first came out got me
rolling into Linux fulltime and didnt screw up my laptop and then lead me to
dual boot RH and XP on my Thinkpad ... I always thought it would make for a
nice PHP (or NYPHP) distro loaded with more PHP stuff to showcase ...

I'd like to guage interest in a Boot CD distribution produced by NYPHP 
to hand out at conferences and other groups' meetings. On boot it would 
start a fairly loaded AMP rig and expose a number of nifty PHP 
applications on port 80.

By default, the CD would load configs and sample data into a ramdisk, 
but we would provide a control-panel interface to 
enable/disable/configure applications and hook them to remote data 
sources (or even mount remote filesystems via webdav). Instant mirror!

What PHP applications would you want to see on such a disc?

Has anyone created a custom Knoppix distro? FreeBSD also has a Live CD 
project...

I would love to be able to run my LAMP apps on a Live CD but more for 
offline demo purposes. For example someone wants to demonstrate their 
website at a conference but has no internet connection. This would 
require being able to create Live CD's myself so any documentation you 
find or create would be great to see. Perhaps the goal would be to 
create a base (small as possible) LAMP Live image and then allow 
developers to add their apps as they needed to.

xampp comes with a few demos
CD Collection  -  php + mysql
Biorhythm  -  creates graph from user's bday
Guest Book  -  php + mysql
Instant Art  -  creates an image with user entered text
Flash Art  -   creates a flash movie of user entered text with ming
phpinfo()  [ok, so it's hardly a demo]
Phone Book  -  php + mysql

and how about some of yopur stuff?
image-list and pWhiteboard
both are great!

I think this is a very good idea; would be a great way to expose people
to AMP and all the various applications available for it - NYppix CD
anyone?  :)

This is the hardest part; we'd have to build a list of available
applications and take a survey.

Yeah, http://www.freesbie.org/  -  we provided a mirror for them but

I'd be partial to use FreeBSD. A much tighter CD package could be made,
IMO, plus we have close working relationships with Freesbie and
http://NYCBUG.org - I think they'd love to collaborate on a project like
this.

There is something called FreeSBIE.

  FreeSBIE project goals are mainly two:
- To develop a suite of programs to be used to create your own CD, with
all the personalizations you like
- To make various ISO images available, maybe each one with its different
goals and possible uses. 

Is that what you're talking about?

Agreed -- we all need to demo apps offline for clients and investors. 
We'd be using free tools to put this together, and we'd document what it 
takes to port a PHP app for use on the CD.

Not sure what we'd provide in the way of a client, tho. If it's just a 
server (and no X-Windows / gui webbrowser) you'd still need to network 
the host in order to connect to it from a workstation. Obviously we 
could distribute a lightweight client environment with it.

I agree on the choice of FreeBSD, if only because that's what I'm most
comfortable with. But there are two things that make me consider Linux:

  1) Brand recognition among the non-technocentric
  2) mount.davfs == nfs for the masses

I'm sure both can be overcome. I'm happy to discuss point 2 at length
with the BSD folk. :-)

I think choosing FreeBSD over Linux for a NYPHP CD give-a-way 
would be a mistake.

Hmmm... but why? 

We could be distro agnostic and produce a specification that developers 
enact using their favorite OS's live cd tools, along with the scripts 
and data we provide. I imagine that would work along the lines of "Build 
your filesystem and binaries, then checkout this CVS module and use this 
httpd.conf and my.cnf"

first, Brand recognition... second, other [sup]ported apps


Let me throw this one out Chris:

I'm all for platform-agnostic -- it's all about AMP... so, 
perhaps in addition to a run-from-CD-NYPHP customized distro we 
think about putting something together on a CD that features 
both the Linux and Windows version of XAMPP with all the 
requisite apps that you want.  More than enough room.

XAMMP doesn't "install" (registry-wise) unless you install[.bat] 
as a service, leaving behind little to clean up -- just remove 
the folder on Windows (typically C:\xampp) and the directory on 
Linux (typically /opt/lampp).

People will be much more likely to fire something up on their 
current system where there is familiarity, rather than load up a 
different o/s and run that way.  Of course, when you're actually 
running a demo for someone, that's a non-issue.

id vote for special themed versions of phpmyadmin and oscommerce that were
NYPHP oriented ... what would really help would be a few PHP5 OO-based apps
(or before/after PHP5) ... the list is practically endless but should be
focused on handing out @ special events i guess ...

the gd/xml/rss/soap topics would be a nice feature even if they are small
demos + include all the NYPHP presentations so far because some of them are
simply awesome by themselves ...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] multiple classes writing to a common container
Message-ID: <405B3DAC.5090201@next-online.net>

All,
I've run into an interesting (for me) problem.  And I thought you all 
might enjoy the solution that I used.

Here's the scenario:
I've got multiple classes that are called by a single php file.  I've 
got a "debug" class that I would like to use to collect debug 
information that is generated by the multiple classes.   Then if the 
page is set to debug "on" then the collected debug information from all 
the classes should be displayed out in one large dump to the screen 
(either as a separate window aka Smarty), or at the bottom of the 
screen.  I'd like to have the multiple classes "know" that they are in 
debug mode vs regular mode.
I've tried a number of approaches and I have read the manual and 
tutorials.  I've experimented with static and pass by reference.  I 
don't think the "extends" structure will work for me, as I will have 
multiple classes, and there's no inherent relationship between the 
classes (other than they're being called by the same page).

I spent a bunch of time spinning around on this, until I changed how I 
was passing the reference of the collector to the working classes.

Here's the (working) code:
<?php

/**
* various tests
*/

I saw this on slashdot today as well. Drool drool! Looks tasty. Too bad
it's non-free.  But I think I might open my wallet for this.

There is no method that returns the native error code, to get it you have
to do something like parse it out of the string returned by getUserInfo()

True or false?

I wonder if it would be possible for the classes to receive a handle to a
debug object (since you have a debug class) then each class on which you'd
want to report merely calls a method on it's "localized" debugger.
Instantiate a single debug object, hand its reference to the constructor in
each class, set it "on" or "off" and let the debug object itself control how
and when it dumps to the screen.

On paper, it sounds like it should play nicely. Please apprise me of the
situation if it doesn't. I'd love to know how it turns out.

False.

Well, 2.6 is .2 higher than 2.4.

Nuh uh. That's why I said "something *like* parse it out of the string
returned by..." [emphasis added] (-: The string returned by getDebugInfo()
is identical (well ok, I mean == ) to that returned by getUserInfo() in
the code I'm playing with right now.

The point being, it looks like you gotta use something like mysql_errno()
(in which case, so much for your abstraction) or parse it yourself.

Hardly the end of the world, just... interesting. Sort of.

OK, let me try to redeem myself after that last wiseassery:

"The new 2.6 Linux kernel enables the efficient distribution of hardware
resources, for example guaranteeing high-quality music and video
performance even as other applications are started and run simultaneously.
The DMA mode also accelerates CD and DVD burning. The Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture (ALSA), which is spearheaded by Novell's SUSE LINUX business
unit, is now an integral component of kernel 2.6. ALSA supports most
common sound cards and provides diverse audio functions. Kernel 2.6 boasts
an improved ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)
implementation, enabling more-efficient power management and extending
battery operation time for laptops."

RE:

Briefly the 2.6 Linux kernel has:

contributions from uClinux 
(Linux for Microcontrollers project)

support for Axis Communications' ETRAX CRIS 
("Code Reduced Instruction Set") processors
(some support was in 2.4 already)

support for NUMA 
("Non-Uniform Memory Access")

(I am a little sketchy on what NUMA is exactly.
But from what I gather certain segments of 
memory can have a stronger affinity for a 
cpu -- or a dma device acting like a cpu -- 
in a multi-cpu setup. NUMA allows a cpu to 
sort of hop-over memory with which it doesn't 
have much/enough affinity.)

Support for hyper-threading ala Pentium 4.

The kernel is  preemptible -- the Linux kernel 
can be interrupted to do something and return to 
what it was doing.

I/O scheduler had a makeover.

futex support
(Fast User-Space Mutexes)

(I am a little sketchy on futexes too -- 
I think they help to serialize access to 
the user space mutexes to help prevent 
race conditions something like "spinlocks" 
with an aditional priority based mechanism)

In summary, the 2.6 Linux kernel has more and 
better hardware support. And a bunch of 
'high end' enhancements for servers.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] multiple classes writing to a common container
In-Reply-To: <405B3DAC.5090201@next-online.net>
References: <405B3DAC.5090201@next-online.net>
Message-ID: <405B64F3.40202@phpwerx.net>

Another way of achieving this functionality without the need to pass 
references to the classes is to use a static var and call the functions 
as class functions rather than object methods.

This would look like:

class Collector
{
   function addItem ($item)
   {
     Collector::collection($item);
     return TRUE;
   }

   function getCollection ()
   {
     echo "<pre>";
     print_r(Collector::collection ());
     echo "</pre>";
     // return TRUE;
     // return Collector::collection ();
   }

   function collection ($item = NULL)
   {
     static $collection = array ();
     if ( isset ($item) )
     {
       $collection[] = $item;
     }
     return $collection;
   }
}

Now any class can use the collection by calling Collector::addItem () 
and Collector::getCollection ().

This approach means that you never have to worry about whether your 
classes are using the same instance of the collector, and will also 
function correctly as a drop in replacement for the collector class below.

Whups, then I misunderstood (: My bad.

You are trying to get the exact error as reported by the database, 
correct?  And if so, is the purpose for error reporting or somesuch?

Actually my wording was a little ambiguous, now that I look at it yet
again. The native error code is *contained* in the string returned by
getUserInfo() so in that sense...  nevermind. (-:

Yeah, I would like to trap Duplicate entry (1062) and tell the user, you
can't do that. I'm working with a table where the rows represent people
and the email must be either NULL or unique. So if DB::isError($result),
I'm parsing $result->getUserInfo().

I know that PEAR has its own DB_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS constant and I guess
that's the equivalent of MySQL's 1062.

Thanks Mitch.

Yeah, there's no method/property that contains the DBMS's native error
number.

Also, keep in mind, that MySQL is the only DBMS that uses that somewhat
vague ALREADY_EXISTS constant.  The others use DB_ERROR_CONSTRAINT.  
MySQL can be told to use the universal/correct constant, you can turn on
the DB_PORTABILITY_ERRORS error mapping portability option.

Hello people,

Are-you going to Montr?al for the Conf?rence PHP Qu?bec?
<http://conf.phpquebec.org/main.php/fr/conf2004/main>

I'm from Montr?al, and the conf is 10 mn walking from my apartment.

It could be fun to do some sort of get together. I know that Adam T. is coming
but I don't know if others from NY-PHP are coming.

Anyway, if you want to hang out with a native Montrealer with a broken English,
just let me know. I'll be pleased to help you appreciate my home town.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

Message-ID: <1079986365.6439.93.camel@bezel>

Hi all,
Not sure if there is an announce list so I am sending this here.
I got a wild-hair this weekend and wrote this program:
http://package.pagepossible.com/
Downloads available.
Saying everyone here is a PHP programmer I thought it might be
interesting to see your reactions to this program and any ideas/thoughts
you had before it gets posted on Hotscripts.

The idea is, it compiles your entire application into a compressed
single-file php script that sets up the application for the end-users.

Source is on the site.

Thanks

The last time you were fishing around for "education help" Hans 
went to the trouble of setting up a site so that you could 
publish a specification of your intentions.  You promptly 
disappeared.

I'm intrigued, this seems like a great idea. I ran into two trouble 
spots in the demo:

- There are problems with escaping " and ' in the fields on the Install 
settings form

- As a sysadmin, I don't like the single-file, precompiled approach. If 
a user handed me one of these to install on a server I would decline. Is 
there a tar.gz option that's a little more transparent?

mean)

Part of the idea is to keep it small/simple and packaged in a container.
an application developer could offer standard install and then offer one
of these as a package for the user who wanted a web-based install.

It really boiled down to what I have been wanting to do for some apps I
give out and a way to standardize things and stop those emails asking
about permissions and how to create a mysql database.

Hi John, I was never aware that hans had
set up a site for the education portal/cms
project. This is news to me! I know we spoke
about setting something up in the past but
nothing really came out it.

Also, unfortunately the past several months
my job situation had changed and had to work
from out of town for a while. So, that set
things back for me.

Anyway, I really want to get this project on
track and I am really looking for some people
to join and help out on this. I will speak to
hans again and see what was set up and move
forward with this.

Hans, would like to hear your comments on this!

Evan

Now that you appear to be back into it, you might think about 
documenting the portal specs since that's where we left off.  As 
I recall, at the time you went and registered a half-dozen or so 
domains and you said you were going to put a spec together for 
comments.  That's when Hans set up the site so that you could 
post the document.

I am.  Now that the long standing bugs that had caused me problems are 
gone, things are working fairly smoothly.

The only oddity is the change in how returns from exec() are handled, 
which I thought was going to be changed back to how PHP 4 did it.  
Whatever.

Oh well, finally convinced them to switch to an abstraction library, 
this will definitely be easier to deal with in the future :)

Yes. I will be there. Tomorrow is known as "Slide Writing Day," as I
need to update my old set of slides to contain all the cool new stuff
that's happened in the last 6 months.

Hello,

What would you guys suggest is the best OO PHP book?
The books I've read on PHP so far only touch on the subject of OO 
programming, I want something that goes way in depth.
Give me your thoughts please.

Thanks,

I think this is a cool idea.  Maybe a quick presentation on it next
month, Joel?  I haven't really seen anything like it in PHP but have
looked.

We now have a formal project acceptance and development process and this
would be a great start on it.  It's outlined in the charter,
http://nyphp.org/charter and we're looking for additional general
documentation to fill in the details of submitting, developing, and
completing a project.

Anyone is welcome to join in... there's much left to do.

That book does not exist largely because you can't really do OO in PHP
4. Now that PHP 5 is coming near, I would guess that your book will
come out sometime in 2005.

However, while I've only skimmed it myself, I've heard excellent
things about George Schlossnagle's "Advanced PHP Programming"
(http://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/blog/)

It has a chapter or two OO and patterns, so that's my "PHP Book of the
Month" for March 2004. Stay tuned for April's selection.

Sounds cool to me, too. I've never used it, but are you sure bcompiler
doesn't already do this?

I have a class that does some db access, and I have a subclass of it that
does some db access. Both classes use a reference to the same global
(PEAR) db_mysql instance.

A method in the subclass does some db stuff through an instance of its
parent, and then goes on if it works; if it fails I would like to roll
back, and return. And guess what: it doesn't roll back. In the method body
I am setting autocommit to 0, and saying "start transaction," and doing
everything right that I can think of.

I'm sparing you the code excerpt in the interest of brevity; it would be
hard to provide enough to show the full picture without abusing bandwidth
and patience. I'm hoping that just based on the above description someone
might catch something that I don't. Is there some subtle gotcha with
classes and objects in PHP4 that I'm running into? I'm working with 4.3.4
and Win2K and MySQL 4.0.13-max-nt-log.

I have tried making the relevant methods in both parent and child report
their connection id, and they say they are using the same connection id.

btw I have run little tests where I do stuff with the same tables, and
roll it back, but without using these objects/classes, and it works. So it
isn't something stupid like wrong table type.

Gratefully,

Thanks, still have a couple bugs but will have a release 2 soon. As for
a presentation.. what do you mean? you mean at the meetings? I honestly
have not been to one yet.. I have a lot of online tutorials and many
programs I have written, and have a *lot* of sourcecode out there as
almost everything I do, I opensource.
http://www.zend.com/comm_person.php?id=96 <- me
let me know, perhaps I could show up and talk about some stuff.. but
honestly would prefer to sit in on at least one meeting first... 

>

I am positive that bcompiler does not do this. bcompiler keep the source
closed so you can attempt to protect your source. What I am doing is
similar to the old 'shell packages' so that files are compressed into
one file that figures out where everything goes depending on user input.
I make heavy use of eval() on compressed code that is eval'd on the fly
but the original source is unpacked so it is not a mechanism you can use
to 'protect' your code.

I am currently mulling over some ideas for integrating 'patch' and
'diff' into php applications so that you could have a 'live upgrade'
option in php apps and that stores diffs and versions so that users
could be notified immediatly that certain files have been updated and
allowed to upgrade just those files at that time. (sort of like what
windows users have with that msupdate thing) I am thinking of offering
that in PHPackage as an option, but it would require a server component
as well. So this may be a plugin for later. Patch used as it is safe for
files that have been changed slightly.. I.e. config options and such
(same reason it is used in cvs)

Anyway... thank you guys for the great feedback.. I would love to see
this used by other people than myself. (oh, the images are encoded in
PHPackage and I have been told there was an issue in windows on IE..
anyone see a broken image?)

I dont think you need to get bogged down looking for a PHP-OO (PHP5), I
think OO in general (or @ least the terms) stem from pretty much any
OO-based language ...

Not to doubt you, but, uh, I guess I will, you're using innodb tables,
right?  Okay, you are.  So, you've got a bug in your code.  Echo out each
query before you execute it.  Make sure the scripts/queries are executing
in the order you expect.  Then, if that doesn't get you no love, go to the
length of copying/pasting the queries in the same order into a MySQL
command line shell.

How does one enables gd on Unix?

I do know that on WIN2K-pro one needs to uncomment the extensions for gd in

find it (so I could tell the admin)... any suggestions?  

Here is what I have from the php_info()

Ouch. So that means it *should* work... but I already rewrote this method
to do all its own SQL and tested it pretty thoroughly. It passed, so I
declared victory and committed it to my little repository. Now I gotta
decide whether to roll back (so to speak) to the previous revision and
wage more war... I was pretty much echoing the hell out of everything. And
yes the tables are InnoDB.

I think I'll go get on the subway now so I can get a front row seat at the
meeting. (Said he, changing the subject (-: )

I believe you need '--with-gd' in your configure command.

(And if I'm wrong I know someone will set the record straight.)

Hi-

sorry to bug y'all with these beginner questions...

I made a little uploading site where I can upload various files, works 
great.
Now I want to archive the folders via the same web ui.
I can't tar anything because the permissions of the uploaded files are:
r-------- (ie: 400)
How can I change the permissions (or set them the way I want) on the 
files as I upload them?

thanks,

Chances are you will also need to have installed libjpeg and libpng for PHP
to compile with the '--with-gd' option. And of course you will need to have
GD installed on your box as well. I just went through this all last night
and had to add those libraries (of course this was compiling php5 on Fedora
Linux against apache 1.3.9). PHP4 has a built in GD library does it not...
anyone?

Yep.  And zlib.

Here's what it took for me to get a _minimal_ PHP 5 build with GD...

./configure --prefix=/path/to/install \
    --with-gd --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/local --with-zlib-dir=/usr/local \

I need some extra brains for a design I'm doing.  Since it's going to
involve XML-RPC and PHP, I figured I'd ask here.

I'm putting together a basic shopping cart.  I can't use existing
solutions because the back end database is called jBASE (a variant of
PICK). jBASE lives on the Production Server behind a LinkSys
firewall/router.  The web site sits on the Web Server and is outside of
the firewall. The plan so far is: user submits a request (places an
order, wants to see Product ID# 1234, etc.) to the Web Server.  The Web
Server does some PHP magic and sends the request to the Production
Server via XML-RPC.  The Production Server does some (PHP?) magic and hands
the request to the database via CGI calls. When the Production Server
responds, the process is reversed.

I don't know how to do the XML-RPC magic above, but tht's part of the
fun of the project.  What I Can't figure out is how to securely transfer
the data between the two servers. I need a secure connection from the
Web Server, through the firewall to the Production Server that can't be
cracked by script kiddies and the like. I tried setting up a VPN tunnel
using FreeS/WAN And Openswan and I can't get them working after a week,
so it's time to try something else.

The client insists that this be done in real-time, so I can't have a
copy of the database on the web server.

Any ideas?

I am a unix guy, so I don't know how to implement this in the Windows 
world - keep that in mind.

One approach I took in the past was to use ssh and port forwarding (e.g. 
forwarding port 9876 on the webserver to 80 on the production machine). 
  Then set tcpwrappers to only allow localhost access to port 9876. 
That way your xml-rpc calls can go to localhost:9876...

You are now talking on a ssh-encrypted tunnel to the production machine.

Does that fit the bill?

I curious to see what others say, because I've never done this, 
exactly.  It sounds like a typical web service, but I'm not sure why it 
is needed to be done this way. With proper precaution, can't the web 
server just interact directly with the database through an SSL?

That's the first thing I do with a fresh PostgreSQL installation, at 
least if the webservers are on separate hardware :)

Another alarming phenomenon I have observed is the everything-or-nothing 
approach, where the whole shebang is either completely in the open, or 
they encrypt everything - even stuff that is then public on the website...

For XML-RPC I've only seen the SSL approach, is there a better practice 
for stuff like this?

SSL is just the poor-man's VPN for these types of things. Honestly, if SSL
had not already proved sufficient in a large number of cases, someone would
have spoken up saying "Use XYZ..."

The only token of opinion I can offer up beyond that is to build an IPSEC
tunnel between a couple of W2K boxes. Seems to me that all that does is use
OS-native functionality to build a VPN instead of a hardware-based secure
tunnel.

Hello folks, thank you for your time and answers.  I will drop this thread
since the sys admin is vehemently adamant that he will only install from the
CD that came with the server (IBM), and it is pre-compiled, and does not
have gd enabled, plus PHP is 4.0.6, plus jpgrpah won't work either...b4 I
shoot him I better give up-  Sigh!

Hi list:
BASICS:
apache 1.3.27, PHP 4.0.6, IBM server


How does one enables gd on Unix?

I do know that on WIN2K-pro one needs to uncomment the extensions for gd in
php.ini...but in Unix I dont see any listings (gd_php.so, etc)...how can I
find it (so I could tell the admin)... any suggestions?  

Here is what I have from the php_info()
Configure Command './configure' '--prefix=/opt/freeware' '--with-apxs'
'--with-mysql' '--with-config-file-path=/etc/opt/freeware/apache'
'--with-ftp' '--with-zlib' '--with-system-regex' '--without-xml'
'--with-ftp' '--with-ssl'

Configuration File (php.ini) Path /etc/opt/freeware/apache/php.ini 

***no gd info***

SERVER_SOFTWARE Apache/1.3.27 (Unix) PHP/4.0.6

Ouch. So that means it *should* work... but I already rewrote this method
to do all its own SQL and tested it pretty thoroughly. It passed, so I
declared victory and committed it to my little repository. Now I gotta
decide whether to roll back (so to speak) to the previous revision and
wage more war... I was pretty much echoing the hell out of everything. And
yes the tables are InnoDB.

I think I'll go get on the subway now so I can get a front row seat at the
meeting. (Said he, changing the subject (-: )

I believe you need '--with-gd' in your configure command.

(And if I'm wrong I know someone will set the record straight.)

Hi-

sorry to bug y'all with these beginner questions...

I made a little uploading site where I can upload various files, works 
great.
Now I want to archive the folders via the same web ui.
I can't tar anything because the permissions of the uploaded files are:
r-------- (ie: 400)
How can I change the permissions (or set them the way I want) on the 
files as I upload them?

thanks,

Chances are you will also need to have installed libjpeg and libpng for PHP
to compile with the '--with-gd' option. And of course you will need to have
GD installed on your box as well. I just went through this all last night
and had to add those libraries (of course this was compiling php5 on Fedora
Linux against apache 1.3.9). PHP4 has a built in GD library does it not...
anyone?

Yep.  And zlib.

Here's what it took for me to get a _minimal_ PHP 5 build with GD...

I need some extra brains for a design I'm doing.  Since it's going to
involve XML-RPC and PHP, I figured I'd ask here.

I'm putting together a basic shopping cart.  I can't use existing
solutions because the back end database is called jBASE (a variant of
PICK). jBASE lives on the Production Server behind a LinkSys
firewall/router.  The web site sits on the Web Server and is outside of
the firewall. The plan so far is: user submits a request (places an
order, wants to see Product ID# 1234, etc.) to the Web Server.  The Web
Server does some PHP magic and sends the request to the Production
Server via XML-RPC.  The Production Server does some (PHP?) magic and hands
the request to the database via CGI calls. When the Production Server
responds, the process is reversed.

I don't know how to do the XML-RPC magic above, but tht's part of the
fun of the project.  What I Can't figure out is how to securely transfer
the data between the two servers. I need a secure connection from the
Web Server, through the firewall to the Production Server that can't be
cracked by script kiddies and the like. I tried setting up a VPN tunnel
using FreeS/WAN And Openswan and I can't get them working after a week,
so it's time to try something else.

The client insists that this be done in real-time, so I can't have a
copy of the database on the web server.

Any ideas?

I am a unix guy, so I don't know how to implement this in the Windows 
world - keep that in mind.

One approach I took in the past was to use ssh and port forwarding (e.g. 
forwarding port 9876 on the webserver to 80 on the production machine). 
  Then set tcpwrappers to only allow localhost access to port 9876. 
That way your xml-rpc calls can go to localhost:9876...

You are now talking on a ssh-encrypted tunnel to the production machine.

Does that fit the bill?

I curious to see what others say, because I've never done this, 
exactly.  It sounds like a typical web service, but I'm not sure why it 
is needed to be done this way. With proper precaution, can't the web 
server just interact directly with the database through an SSL?

That's the first thing I do with a fresh PostgreSQL installation, at 
least if the webservers are on separate hardware :)

Another alarming phenomenon I have observed is the everything-or-nothing 
approach, where the whole shebang is either completely in the open, or 
they encrypt everything - even stuff that is then public on the website...

For XML-RPC I've only seen the SSL approach, is there a better practice 
for stuff like this?

SSL is just the poor-man's VPN for these types of things. Honestly, if SSL
had not already proved sufficient in a large number of cases, someone would
have spoken up saying "Use XYZ..."

The only token of opinion I can offer up beyond that is to build an IPSEC
tunnel between a couple of W2K boxes. Seems to me that all that does is use
OS-native functionality to build a VPN instead of a hardware-based secure
tunnel.

DOH!  I hadn't thought of SSL.  That will take care of encrypting the
client data, now I need to secure the Production Server from people
getting through the firewall.

What do I care about Windows?  I'm a Linux guy and all the servers
involved are Linux. :-)

Sounds good, but how does that stop crackers?

See, my main concern is that to make this work I have to open a whole in
the firewall via port forwarding.  Okay, so it's only for port 80, but
now that that port is open, the production server is exposed.  What's
stopping a cracker from emulating the Web Server? Putting tcpwrappers or
iptables on the Prodn Server isn't going to work, since all packets will
look like they're coming from the firewall (192.168.1.1) and I know of
no way to differentiate the packets once they've been NATed.

It is a "typical web service".

Fine.  But how do I stop Cracker Joe from emulating the web server and

4.0.6 is from June of 2001. It's so ancient, it's pretty much
unsuported by everyone. More importantly, it's also missing a variety
of security-related patches.

See "File Uploads Security Fix" on
http://www.php.net/downloads.php. There's a patch for 4.0.6 (and a few
others versions of PHP). There's also problem with the
--enable-memory-limit configuration option.

If your sys admin thinks he's being safe by using the copy of PHP from
the CD, he's completely wrong.

I was going to respond the the first letter but I'll combine here...

I wasn't the first to bring up SSL, I just brought up that it seems silly to
reinvent a well-worn wheel for the prospect you raise.

Hopefully I'm not being patronizing when I ask you not to forget that most
firewalls should be able to handle a security protocol such that you can
allow SSL in and out only for specific IP addresses, and further constrain
the ports on which traffic may pass. SSL runs on 443 and not 80, so that's
one problem out of the way. As far as emulating a webserver, there's not
much you can do about that. However, if you have your *own* code running at
both ends, there's nothing to stop you from using private encryption on the
datastream within the SSL tunnel.

No one said PKI was easy :-) Im looking for a paper I found in regards to
OTP (one-time-password) stuff using rotating public keys that used XML-RPC
as an example ... when I find it I will pass along ... I think datapower.com
put it out but I really just skimmed it ...

You're right, it does seem silly.  One of the reasons I posted the

I can do port forwarding, if that's what you mean.

443, 80, it doesn't matter which port is open.  What matters is *A* port
is open.

Hmmm, that would take care of web server emulation cracker, then the only way to
break in would be to crack the web server emulate the calls from iside
the web server box.  Better, better...

My comment might be a little misleading - what I meant is "allow traffic in
and out for specific IP addresses" I figure this might be under IP
Filtering, if it's there at all?

True, but then likely so is 53 for DNS, 3306 for MySQL, and probably a few
others, despite your precautions. Locking an entire server down to do all
its work over a single port may be folly, so consider this carefully - is it
a problem you must solve in total, or merely steer clear of?

Actually that's about all you've got left. If someone can get inside your
webserver, they've probably already severely compromised the firewall. I'd
probably ask someone more in tune with Linux security to chime in on that.

So I'm going to restate the standing question:
How can you prevent someone from stealing all the chickens once they've made
it past the firewall and into the henhouse?

Not on my networks. :-)  The webserver is outside the firewall and has
all those ports open.  Everything else is behind the firewall and
*NOTHING* is open on that firewall.

If they get inside the firewall, they've got access to the internal
network and all bets are off. That's why I'm trying to keep them from
getting through the firewall.

If nothing is open, why is it connected to an exterior network at all?

And if nothing is open, how do you expect the web server to communicate 
with the database server?  It's like inviting a friend over for lunch but 
not opening the a door for them when they arrive.

Nothing is open from the outside.  All traffice is initiated from the
inside. Like this::


Internal network -------firewall------ Big Bad Internet
                     |            |
Production Server----|            |------web server

At the moment, it can't.  I want to open up a teeny-tiny hole on the
firewall to let the web server in, but I'm very paranoid about people
breaking in, hence my original question.  

If I forward Firewall:80 to ProdnServer:80, that will let the web server
in and everyone else on the Big Bad Internet.  I can use SSH/SSL to
encrypt the data from the Web Server to the Production Server but I need
to minimize/remove all acapabilities for the Big Bad Internet to get to
ProdnServer:80.

Have you tested your network with the latest nmap from the outside?  Not to
say that security by obscurity is 100% (id be fired :-) but tweaking your
banners for those fingerprints reduce the risk somewhat (and tweaking ICMP,
SYN-ACK stuff).  I really dont think you can expect much more when you are
connected to the Big Bad Internet.

Right along side that is, once you've masked your handshakes a smidgeon,
translate them to "non-standard" ports - HTTP on port 1080, SSL on 1443,
etc.

No can do.  If one machine can get through, then anyone that can get to 
that machine can get through.  Whatever security/encryption schemes are 
implemented on the webserver are bypassed by compromising the webserver. 
  And once gaining access to the production server, the whole shebang is 
now for the taking.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is an example of what I call the "Armadillo 
Security Model".  Hard on the outside, soft on the inside.  Firewalls 
are perhaps less than 30% of your real risk, but the firewall sales 
pitches have created an entirely inaccurate depiction of the real world.

One possible remedy is to push the data from the production server to 
the webserver, which would protect your internal network at least. 
Unfortunately, you will not be able to protect the data (should the 
webserver become compromised); and your data will no longer be 'real 
time' data.

What is more important to your organization:  your data, your internal 
network, or your website?  Let the suits make this call, and the rest 
becomes academic.

I know.  I'm trying to minimize that.

That architecture is what I've been pushing since Day One. As for
placing orders and the like, the Prodn Server would periodically reach
out to the Web Server and grab the data. No holes in the firewall and
I'm happy.

The suits made their call; I'm trying to minimize the danger.

Not the latest nmap, but nmap is one of the things I do after setting up
a box/network.

nmap says the firewall in question  is down. ;-)

Well, if the production server is never supposed to see traffic from the 
outside world but needs contacting from inside the company, have a 
completely separate network.  But this isn't what you're asking about.

None the less, it can be part of your solution.  Are the web server and
production server on the same premesis?  If so, you can create a real
private network between them.  Of course, this doesn't let one completely
off the hook, since the web server can be compromised and then make
attempts to subvert the production server.  But it's better than nothing
if connectivity is needed between the web and production servers.

True.  That's one of the reasons I'm against it, but the suits have
other ideas. <shrug>


Thanks for all the ideas guys.  I have enough ideas and ammo that I can

But how?  Once the packet have gone through the firewall, the IP Address
has been changed.  Any packets hitting Prodn:80 are going to be seen
coming from 192.168.1.1 whether the original packet is coming from 
the Web Server or from Cracker Joe.

Well, I wrote that before I read a bunch of followup to the original 
post, but that sounds more like a proxy to me. Some firewalls just 
filter based on rules but don't change the original packet.
But anyway, that was superceded by a bunch of suggestions by some more 
knowledgable than me. Good Luck.

I figured out what was going on and thought I'd follow up, if only for the
sake of someone else who encounters this down the road and searches the
list archives for help.

It appears -- according to my experiments -- that if you lock and unlock
table X inside a transaction and then try to roll back an update to table
X, it will won't roll back. Evidently you need to roll back before you
unlock.

Perhaps this is obvious to those who are more knowledgeable, but to me it
wasn't, and I didn't find any relevant clues from RTFM. books, or google.
My several hours of head-banging may have been inefficient, but not
completely unproductive (-:

you may want to limit the ability to "drop" a database for the demo.
or have it auto-populate from a test file..

Anyway, I will definitly be making some use of this code.

Depends on the DBMS you're using.  The SQL-99 standard says this is the 
syntax to use:
   select * from data where name similar to '[0-9]%';

Dropping any table on the demo page is not an error.
I made this page so you can create, edit and drop
table as you wish.
There the ENGLISH/ARABIC dictionary that implement the
PHPBTREE. It contains over 15000 words and you can
find any word in no time. I beleive most applications
out there don't need the overhead of a database
server.

Nice, an interesting concept.  The only question I have is how to

Also, any benchmarks run versus RDBMS?  Just curious ;^)

Where have I heard that before?  Come to think of it, give me the

I agree - and am already thinking about ways to use something like this, 
as it should be very handy for long lists of data...

hi and thanks. i tried the below, but for some reason it didn't work. no

recommended and it worked fine:

SELECT * FROM data WHERE LEFT(NAME, 1) REGEXP "[0-9]";

Being able to drop or edit anything on the demo page
is not an error. The purpos of this demo is to let you
perform various actions to see how the btree performs.
Since this is open source project any input is
welcome.
The DICTIONARY on the demo page is an implementation
of the PHPBTREE. It contains over 15000 words and you
can find any word in the tree in almost no time.
PHPBTREE could be a better solution for most
applications out that don't need the overhead of a
database server (query parsing and excution).


Very cool.. very cool indeed...

Actually this concept has been done before (albeit not neatly) and you are
right about the recursive hell, that is really what the Alicebot project was
<srai>RECURSIVE HELL</srai> srai = symbolic reduction ...

A perfect example of code (in PHP) is here:
http://www.rydell.com/programe/

In Java the design was called the "Graphmaster" which created btree nodes
... (to be honest in simplicity it was more an XML-based regular expression
engine) ...

Now we're talkin' fun!  Pushing the envelope even further, what if the 
value returned was a serialised PHP array or object, possibly with other 
{btree:key} values embedded?

Monthly meeting attendees are vaguely familiar with airports lookup by 
city/state/airport-name keys, where a single key may correspond to 
multiple airports.  For example, a lookup on key "los angeles" might 
return a serialised PHP array with the airport codes of all LA-area 
airports.

Happy Friday, all.

At this moment, I am writing a traffic shaper using mod_rewrite with a
little php script that has to figure out if a user has multiple
downloads (tick function there) and throttle each download on the fly
accordingly, based on a total allowable max speed, and per-day max..
Plus, all current downloads going on and ability to throttle all based
on max 'entire server' allowed download speed based on time of day..

array fun fun fun... :)

I am considering this btree for keeping a serialized shared mem segment
holding current downloads, so it was nice to see that today.

This is just a starting point. 
For now you have the responsability to build
relationships between tree in your application. It
should be noted that PHPBTREE does intend to be a
database server. It should be looked at as a data
management system, if I can use that term.

I'd be curious to learn how much you guys use unit testing with something
like PHPUnit. I have played with it, and it is satisfying, but i haven't
fully found religion, haven't gone to the X(P)treme of literally writing
the test *before*  the code the test tests.

It surely isn't a panacea and there seem to be cases where a "traditional"
test (does this page fetch a row of data and display it? load it in a
browser and look at the output) is as good, maybe even more appropriate,
than a PHPUnit test.

Perhaps... an idea for a presentation and/or Phundies topic?

Really David, if you want to remove your Phundies and play with your 
PHPUnit I think that's entirely up to you.

I love the unit test specification:
"non-XP terminology (?), not quite synonymous with ProgrammerTest. A
UnitTest measures a unit of software, without specifying why. A
ProgrammerTest assists programmers in development, without specifying
how." (from: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTest)

yea, that makes *complete* sense....

don't use it..

David,
I do a lot of unit testing.  I've used the PEAR unit test package and, well,
um.  didn't like it much.  I am using and really really like the Simple_Test
package.

If you want I can send samples.

Message-ID: <4064DC90.6010708@optonline.net>

I'm running into the following problem (this is on a shared server).

If I use the standard PHP mail function to send mail, the "From " 
address says "unprivileged user" because I'm not using a legitimate 
account that is associated with the domain.

However, if I manipulate the mail headers so that it uses an existing 
email account (specifically noresponse at mydomain.com), additional headers 
(see below) are added and are dumped into the message body. These 
headers are added by the ISP. So...just wondering how do I use the 
headers to specify the "from" address without having these headers 
dumped into the message body.

I've never managed to get the built-in mail functions to work, but I 
didn't try too hard because PEAR::Mail was so easy to use.  Maybe you 
could give that a try?

I haven't used these yet but I'm going to RSN.  Can you compare htme
with CPAN's Test, Test::Simple and Test::Harness (which is what I was
going to use).

BTW, to the fellow who mention that he hasn't gotten Xtreme enough to
write tests first before writing code, I suggest you try it.  It really
does change how you write code and it works very well, IMHO.

BTW, "test first, code second" is the *only* thing I've taken from XP,
so you know I'm not an XP zealot. :-)

I'd be interested in seeing those.

I don't quite follow what you're explaining here. What looks fine in your
browser, exactly?

At first glance, this sounds like Microsoft Word might be involved
somehow. It replaces single quotes, double quotes, hyphens, and ellipses
with invalid characters. There is a way to disable this in Word, and I
seem to recall some software written to substitute the real characters for
these invalid ones. I can't seem to find it at the moment, however. I'll
look harder if this is in fact your problem.

It was imported by OOo from a probably WP, but in vi(m) it shows as 
apostrophes and in my borwser on the local webserver it shows fine too. 
It's just when putting it "out there" that it comes up with the odd 
characters.

Erg, never mind. Not sure but in the transfer from here to there via tar 
and sftp it got changed. Or something in vim isn't showing here that is 
there. The file looks right under vi(m) on the machine I'm developing 
on. After I sftp it up and use vi(m) on the remote machine the odd 
characters are there.

gag.

I remembered the software that gets rid of the Microsoft stuff in

It's weirder than that. If I look at the same document on my two local 
machines they look fine. Even if I sftp one back from the remote host it 
looks fine. But a vi on the remote host shows the odd character code for 
the " and ' characters.

Can't blame MS on this one, much as I'd like to...

Could it be the code page/locale that's being used?  DO an 'echo $LANG'
and see what the settings are. I'll bet one is UTF And the other isn't.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Which XMLRPC server/client do you use?
Message-ID: <20040329012959.GB29798@uranus.faber.nom>

Well, I'm finally getting on to the next phase of my project, namely
setting up a web service between two Apache boxes.  

In my reading of XMLRPC, I came across the O'Reilly book and the authors
made available the client and server code mentioned in their book. It
can be found at phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net.  I think I'm going to start
with that to get a handle on XMLRPC.

I was wondering, for those of you who have already done/are doing web
services, what code/package do you use to do the server and client sides
in PHP?

Hello everyone,
some of you have downloaded the PHPBTREE source code
since I have anounced it last friday. I have made a
*minor change to the code. If you're going to use it,
I suggest you get the new code here:
http://www.phpbtree.com 
*The minimum number of records per node was set 2.
that was an error. 4 is the correct number.

I didn't look at the website mentioned in the initial post nor was it
clear what the person was talking about, but I too have an inklink thats
what they were talking about.  If that's the case here, this should prove
handy:

         $Data = preg_replace('/[\x07\x95]/', '-', $Data);
         $Data = preg_replace('/\x85/', '...', $Data);
         $Data = preg_replace('/[\x91\x92]/', '\'', $Data);
         $Data = preg_replace('/[\x93\x94]/', '&quot;', $Data);

Hi Faber

I have implemented XML-RPC based web services originally using libraries
developed by Simon Willison (a Sitepoint contributor IIRC)
http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/ I found the code very easy to implement
and customise to suit our purposes...

Hi all,

Been a lurker for a month or two and love this list!

OK, now that I've buttered you all up... ;-)

I have never understood the difference between using single quotes (') 
and double quotes (") in my code other than for nesting purposes and (I 
may be getting the name wrong) string literals and when including 
variables in strings.

Can anyone shed light on the proper use of single and double quotes for me?

Many thanks!

A string inside of double quotes is always parsed for execution.  That 
means that php will look inside the string and check for any code that 
can be executed.

A string inside of single quotes is never parsed for execution.  The 
string will just be taken literally and code inside of it will not be 
executed.

$stuff = 'things';
echo "I like $stuff"; // output: I like things
echo 'I like $stuff'; // output: I like $stuff

In general you should use double quotes when you want part of a string 
to be parsed and executed.  You should use single quotes otherwise.

It should be noted also that using the single quotes where appropriate
is more efficient; it lets the parser know that there's nothing to
evaluate.

If you're like me and also concerned with your own efficiency (and
supporting your general laziness), there's also the benefit of not having
to escape quotes within single quotes or single quotes within quotes:

$foo = "This doesn't require escaping.";
$bar = '"Cool," said Chris.';

Message-ID: <7D9EDDBA-81A6-11D8-B40F-000A95BAE752@next-online.net>

All,
I've run into something I'm not sure how to fix.

Trying to insert some values into a table in Oracle using PEAR::DB.

Here's the error I'm getting:
[nativecode=ORA-00911: invalid character]

Here's the SQL:
INSERT INTO EVENT (
			"APPLICATION",
			"COMPANYNUMBER",
			"DATELASTMODIFIED",
			"DATERECORDADDED",
			"EVENTINFO",
			"LOGINNAME",
			"OFFICENUMBER",
			"OID",
			"OIDEVENTTYPE",
			"PAGENAME",
			"SESSIONID"
			) VALUES (
			'AccessPointAP_VERSION',
			'',
			TO_DATE ('3/26/2004','MM/DD/YYYY'),
			TO_DATE ('3/26/2004','MM/DD/YYYY'),
			'this is the message',
			'',
			'',
			HEXTORAW ('323037323036363233373632'),
			HEXTORAW ('EF532CBE3C925A7F3FEC77F3'),
			'',
			''
			);

Here's the describe on the table:
  Name                                            Null?    Type
  ----------------------------------------- --------

  APPLICATION                                         VARCHAR2(32)
  COMPANYNUMBER                             NUMBER
  DATELASTMODIFIED               NOT NULL DATE
  DATERECORDADDED            NOT NULL DATE
  EVENTINFO                                            VARCHAR2(255)
  LOGINNAME                                           VARCHAR2(60)
  OFFICENUMBER                                   NUMBER
  OID                                                NOT NULL RAW(12)
  OIDEVENTTYPE                        NOT NULL RAW(12)
  PAGENAME                                            VARCHAR2(48)
  SESSIONID                                             VARCHAR2(48)

And finally here's the code:
putenv("ORACLE_HOME=/usr/local/share/oracli");
require_once ("DB.php");
$dsn = "oci8://user:pass at inst";
$this->db = DB::connect($dsn);
$sql = "INSERT INTO EVENT ( ... )";
$rs = $this->db->query($sql);

Any suggestions?
I've tried all kinds of things in the SQL.  Obviously missing something 
important.  BTW I don't know from Oracle.
Thanks in advance.

  ORA-00911 invalid character

          Cause: Special characters are valid only in certain places. If
          special characters other than $, _, and # are used in a name and
          the name is not enclosed in double quotation marks ("), this
          message will be issued. One exception to this rule is for database
          names; in this case, double quotes are stripped out and ignored.

          Action: Remove the invalid character from the statement or enclose
          the object name in double quotation marks.


Maybe, try getting rid of the quote marks around the field names.  I'd
also advise not using quoted identifiers in general, they cause more
headaches than they solve.

Message-ID: <40689047.2010106@adnet-sys.com>

[PHP]
          if (is_array($_POST["assoc_$key"])) {
           foreach ($this->getAssocSectionsObjArray($key, $dbAP) as $obj) {
            print_r($obj); print_r(" in array? "); 
print_r(in_array($obj, $result)); print_r("<P>");
            if (!in_array($obj, $result)) array_push($result, $obj);
           }
          }
[/PHP]

Here is the output of the result of this script:

[Quote]
stdClass Object ( [id] => 2 [placement_name] => Placement #1 ) in array?

/image_catalog/include/classes.inc.php on line 99

[/Quote]

What I have to do is compare an array of objects, $result, with another 
array of objects, $this->getAssocSectionsObjArray($key, $dbAP).  Both 
arrays will be identical in structure and object formatting, but not in 
object data content.  What I need to do is to find out if that one array 
has the very same object as the other, then don't add it to $result, 
otherwise, add to $result.

The object formatting is as follows:

[Quote]obj: stdClass Object ( [id] => 2 [placement_name] => Placement #1 
)[/Quote]

And $result can look like this:

[Quote]
result: Array ( [0] => stdClass Object ( [id] => 6 [placement_name] => 
Placement #27 ) [1] => stdClass Object ( [id] => 2 [placement_name] => 
Placement #1 ) )
[/Quote]
I don't wish to loop through both arrays, that would be a performance 
nightmare to do that.  Is there a version of in_array in existence for 
comparing objects?

Thanx
Phil

PS: I went to this manual example at 
[url]http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php#40079[/url] but 
that involves recursive handling and object rebuilding - this, were I to 
figure out what the living blue it is, would have to be put inside 
another loop.. OUCH!

One disadvantage, however, is that these single and double quotation marks 
display as typewriter style (that is, straight).  If you want typeset style 
(that is, curved, as in a book) single and double quotation marks, you need 
to do something like this:
$foo = "This doesn&#8217;t require escaping.";
$bar = '&#8220;Cool,&#8221; said Chris.';

This, however, is further dependent on font and (I believe) font size; 
sometimes there is no apparent difference between the typewriter and 
typeset styles as displayed.  An example of this is on the various 
PHundamentals articles, where I am in the habit of using the typeset ones 
and Jeff Siegel is in the habit of using either the keyboard symbols or 
&quot;--but they all look the same.

But now we are getting really OT and onto aesthetics.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Uploading animated gifs
Message-ID: <6B08E780-81C9-11D8-8B69-000502F1DDFC@click3x.com>

Is there something special that needs to be done in order to upload 
animated GIFs to a webserver via a post-form?

The reason I am asking this is that I designed a small 
"content-management system" (ie: extranet) where users can post photos, 
movie-clips and documents. Everything uploads fine except for when I 
upload an animated gif file. For example, when I upload a 20 KB 
animated gif, the file in the uploads directory is 4KB and doesn't 
display as what it should be. It won't even open in Preview or 
Photoshop or ImageReady . I CAN open it in a web browser and it's some 
illegible graphic that says something like "Error Loading 
/Library/WebServer" but I'm not sure (I've attached the graphic).

If any of you have any idea what the heck is going on, please enlighten 
me, I really don't get it.

is the path to the desired gif correct?  This looks like an error message 
transformed into an image.

I'd have to say you're right. Both local boxes are en_US.UTF-8 and the 
remote is blank. Can I fix it as a user or do I need to talk to the 
hosting people?

Short but not the world's most efficient way to do it:

if (! preg_match('/googlebot/i', $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) {
     session_start();
}

You probably want to expand that regex to account for all the robots you 
know/care about.

I did some experimenting and I think it might be the result of a 
resizing function I am using because if I upload the files without 
resizing them, they get served OK. I think I found the source of my 
anguish.

Nope, because a robot doesn't have to let you know that it's a robot.

However, you can identify the major ones, because they pass a consistent
User-Agent identifying themselves. Here are some agents from my access
logs that look like robots to me (some are truncated):

OK, there are more than I thought, so I'll stop there. :-)

Well, it turns out if you have semi colon at the end of your sql then 
you get the ORA-00911 error. 
So:
INSERT INTO TABLENAME ("field", "field") VALUES ('one', 'two');
will result in an error, PEAR::DB returns "unknown error".

while:
INSERT INTO TABLENAME ("field", "field") VALUES ('one', 'two')
[note............................................................................................................^]
will work just fine.

Please note that the Oracle error: ORA-00911 doesn't say anything about 
semicolons.  Which is another reason why Oracle is better than MySQL.

Somebody shoot me now.

You'll have to talk to the hosting people or change it on your system.
Oh, and just changing the LANG var won't work, it has to be changed in
the configuration files and the box rebooted.  Assuming both boxen are
Red Hat, RH did something very low-level that screws things up.  There
was a long discussion of this over at the linuxgazette.net.  We never
figured out what they did, but it affects perl (can I mention that
language in here? :-) output as well.

Using a similar method, I'd once created for a client an include that would
come in above all other code.  Basically it would check the user_agent for
the majority of the robots I could figure out (via the logs - Mr. Shiflett
just gave a good list to start with) and if the current user agent wats one,
it would essentaily spit out a huge list of links to every product
throughout the site with the title of the product as the text of the link.
And then it would exit().  Within 3 weeks the entire site was indexed (some
within a couple days).

You could also put this conditional include at the bottom of your scripts
which would essentially give the search engines an automated and immediate
sitemap, of course then that site map will be cached with the pages.

Not sure if it would still work for all the engines, but it did the job mid
last year.

FWIW, these ones are actually RSS aggregators instead of
spiders. They're still robots, but they probably won't crawl your
site, if that's what you care about w/r/t sessions.

Thanks, I'll give that a shot.  

The XML-RPC from the O'Reilly book is now working, but I'm a bit
bothered that there isn't any traffic in the orums for over two years
and that other people had questions like I did and never got answers.
I'd like to find something with a bit more support.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Where do name spaces come from?
Message-ID: <20040330055113.GB16449@uranus.faber.nom>

While working on my XML-RPC project, I keep coming across code like
this:

$disp_map = array( "server.helloWorld" =>
			<snip>
	            "server.echoback" =>
			<snip>
            );

What's confusing me is the "server." notation.  I haven't seen a guide
on where that comes from (why "server" in this example and not "foo"?).
Is it the file name?  If so, why did changing the file name to
"my_server.php" and renaming the name space appropriately not work?  Is
it some sort of internally defined name (although I couldn't find it in
the file)?

I looked up "name space" on php.net and found stuff about DOM which is
not applicable here, I beleive.

XML-RPC was written by Dave Winer. Dave also wrote a system called
Frontier. Frontier used the "." as a namespace / path
separator. (Frontier is a weird hybrid scripting language / object
database system that's now been extended to include a web server and
more. It's hard to explain if you've never seen it.) So, what in PHP
is mysql_query() would be mysql.query() in Frontier.

>From this background I conclude that when Dave wrote up the original
XML-RPC examples, he just used Frontier notation and everybody else
copied it blindly.

I don't think it has to be anything. See this quotation from the spec
(http://www.xml-rpc.com/spec):

As you can see, it's entirely up to you how to choose what naming
convention you wish to use.

The easiest thing, given that PHP lacks namespaces, is to omit the
period completely and just have the value stored in the <methodName>
be the name of your PHP function. Or not. :)

I would like to propose the PEAR XML-RPC class. It's a vital part of
PEAR (i.e. the whole system fails to function if it's broken), so you
know it's going to be supported.

David Sklar's new "Essential PHP Tools: Modules, Extensions, and
Accelerators" (Apress) has a whole chapter on PEAR's XML-RPC
class. There's also the PEAR Manual
(http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.webservices.php).

This package isn't as fast as the bundled C extension (libxmlrpc), but
that code is essentially orphaned, AFAIK. So, while it may work,
you're on your own for support.

Howdy folks,

I haven't looked extensively at the PEAR documentation, but from what I did
see, I couldn't find a means of getting an inserted ID after an insert
query. Using mysql_insert_id($dbh->connection) works, but abstracting away
from db-specific code is the whole point of PEAR::DB right? Any thoughts?

Eric

Not all DBMS's provide that capacity.  The closest thing DB has is 
sequences.  Read that Intro section in the manual.  I'd provide a URI, but 
pear.php.net isn't responding right now.

I'm not using PEAR::DB (yet), but what I do with MySQL when I need to
find this out is:

1) Lock the table
2) Insert what needs to get inserted
3) Query the ID out of the table order by id desc limit 1
4) Unlock the table

This assumes, of course, that your IDs are auto_increment.

Bleach. :) Use mysql_insert_id() instead and you can skip the table locking.

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-insert-id.php

Yes, it's smart enough to return your insert id even if a different
process inserts another row into the table in between your insert and
the call to mysql_insert_id().

Thanks for the tips. mysql_insert_id() it is.

Although I am curious about the forementioned sequences. I'll look a little
deeper.

For some context:

Perhaps it's obvious, perhaps it's not, the whole point of grabbing the id
of an auto-incremented record is to records to related tables using the
inserted id as a foreign key. For example, after insterting a record into a
'user' table, I need to use the id of that user as the 'userid' in an
'emailaddresses' table. I just imagined that the best way to do this is to
use something analagous to mysql_inserted_id() to get the id. Is there a
better way to do a series of related inserts?

Eric.

Actually, after looking at the sequences in PEAR::DB, I think that might be
an interesting solution. Although the docs are pretty scant. Does anyone
have more experience using this?

In my continual pursuit of plugging David's book, I suggest "Essential
PHP Tools: Modules, Extensions, and Accelerators" by David Sklar. The
first chapter is on PEAR::DB and the second is on ADODB.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590592808/trachtenberg-20/ref=nosim

Of course, Daniel knows more about PEAR::DB than Mr. Pear himself, but
it's sometimes easier to read up about a subject before subjecting the
maintainer to questions.

Hi List:

BASICS: Apache 1.3.29
	  PHP 4.3.4 (compiled with gd and ttf)
	  TrueType installed
OS:	AIX 5 on a IBM machine
OTHER: Correctly listed TTF_DIRECTORY path in jpgraph.php

BACKGROUND: Using jpgraph to produce some dynamic graphs from MySQL db.

ISSUE: Looks like a TrueType issue.  The graph appears correctly but without
Titles or lables on either axis.

I have tried jpgraph forum but cannot get anyone to answer (low traffic
perhaps).  This list has had helped me from my novice days (starting) to now
(mid level)...so if this is off-topic my apologies... however, any
suggestion is deeply appreciated!

SUMMARY: graphs image appears but without title or axis labels.  Font used
are VERDANA, or TIMES

Much regards,

Rafi

I would like to propose the PEAR XML-RPC class. It's a vital part of
PEAR (i.e. the whole system fails to function if it's broken), so you
know it's going to be supported.

David Sklar's new "Essential PHP Tools: Modules, Extensions, and
Accelerators" (Apress) has a whole chapter on PEAR's XML-RPC
class. There's also the PEAR Manual
(http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.webservices.php).

This package isn't as fast as the bundled C extension (libxmlrpc), but
that code is essentially orphaned, AFAIK. So, while it may work,
you're on your own for support.

Howdy folks,

I haven't looked extensively at the PEAR documentation, but from what I did
see, I couldn't find a means of getting an inserted ID after an insert
query. Using mysql_insert_id($dbh->connection) works, but abstracting away
from db-specific code is the whole point of PEAR::DB right? Any thoughts?

Not all DBMS's provide that capacity.  The closest thing DB has is 
sequences.  Read that Intro section in the manual.  I'd provide a URI, but 
pear.php.net isn't responding right now.

I'm not using PEAR::DB (yet), but what I do with MySQL when I need to
find this out is:

1) Lock the table
2) Insert what needs to get inserted
3) Query the ID out of the table order by id desc limit 1
4) Unlock the table

This assumes, of course, that your IDs are auto_increment.

Bleach. :) Use mysql_insert_id() instead and you can skip the table locking.

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-insert-id.php

Yes, it's smart enough to return your insert id even if a different
process inserts another row into the table in between your insert and
the call to mysql_insert_id().

Thanks for the tips. mysql_insert_id() it is.

Although I am curious about the forementioned sequences. I'll look a little
deeper.

For some context:

Perhaps it's obvious, perhaps it's not, the whole point of grabbing the id
of an auto-incremented record is to records to related tables using the
inserted id as a foreign key. For example, after insterting a record into a
'user' table, I need to use the id of that user as the 'userid' in an
'emailaddresses' table. I just imagined that the best way to do this is to
use something analagous to mysql_inserted_id() to get the id. Is there a
better way to do a series of related inserts?

Eric.

Actually, after looking at the sequences in PEAR::DB, I think that might be
an interesting solution. Although the docs are pretty scant. Does anyone
have more experience using this?

In my continual pursuit of plugging David's book, I suggest "Essential
PHP Tools: Modules, Extensions, and Accelerators" by David Sklar. The
first chapter is on PEAR::DB and the second is on ADODB.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590592808/trachtenberg-20/ref=nosim

Of course, Daniel knows more about PEAR::DB than Mr. Pear himself, but
it's sometimes easier to read up about a subject before subjecting the
maintainer to questions.

/ref=nosim.  What's that do?  Hack, hack, hack.  Oh!  Handy.  I've now

Sounds good to me. :)  Not to disuade anyone from using David's book, I've
put in considerable time refining PEAR DB's documentation.
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.php  If anyone finds
something there unclear, please do let me know so I can make the docs even 
better.

Definitely. The PEAR DB docs are excellent. They are the role model for 
all the other PEAR modules!

Hi all,

Back from Montreal and the PHP Quebec Conference.  With apparently no
more phpCon either in the West or East, I'd recommend Quebec.  The
turnout was huge, and the conference, talks, and activities were very
well put together and organized.  Damien Seguy and the PHP Quebec team
did a great job, and I strongly recommend it as a PHP conference in
North America.

Best,

I had a great time. Lots of interesting people.

Best thing about the conference is that they really do speak French up
there! Even better than trying to get a Canadian to say "about." :)

Also, there's some good prices on liquor served up the duty free on the
way home.

Well... maybe not too far off :)

NYPHP, along with some of the larger groups in NY like NYCBUG and NYLUG,
is considering an informal get-together this summer in Central park,
some thereabouts.  It wouldn't be PHP specific, but certainly a great
way to meet with others in various Open Source circles.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Looking for comparison engine.
Message-ID: <4069ED1E.8090602@prusak.com>

Hi all,

I'm looking for a "comparison engine" for PHP.
I'm not sure if this is the correct term though.

Basically, it's something what you see on many retail sites that allow 
you to pick what items you want to compare by checking a checkbox and 
then click on the compare button and you get a comparison view of the items.

For example:
Before:
http://www1.shopping.com/xPP-Digital_Cameras
After:
http://www1.shopping.com/xSBS-Digital_Cameras~PG-1~NCP-3~PRDLT-21078036-21848960-21858761

I know it would be easy to roll my own solution, but it it's already 
been done, no point in re-inventing the wheel.

Thanx
Ophir

Hello.
I'm using a graph class to generate stats. This class requires one var named $names witch must be $names=("name1","name2","name3",...) ( from class example).
I need to construct some graph with data retrieved from a mysql database.
Any ideea how to output a mysql query result into that format ?

When I print_r $names i see something like that : Array ( [0] => text1 [1] => text2 [2] => test3 )

if you just need the values of the array for your class use array_values() like:

$names = array_values($text_array);

Solved my problem:
  $results=array();
   while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($firme)) {
    array_push ($results, $row['ClientClassName']);
  }
print_r ($results) will display something similar to Array ( [0] => text1 [1] => text2 [2] => test3 )

im trying to figure this out + not sure if a hack in php will work ...

someone wants to throw in a klipmart like app (video) for only broadband
users however i had a tough time explaining that there are a few factors to
consider like the load and that there was no way to programmatically
determine a clients connection speed through php itself.

my thinking for a hack include something like a hidden page which does a
session-based request in which a test image is sent out and then performing
a onload() back to the server and testing the session times ... but is this
practical?  any other ideas?

(people are out to kill the net) lol

I haven't tried this, but it seems like it could work... If you're at all
proficient with flash, you could probably take a preloader script (basically
loads a file and reports the bytes_loaded / bytes_total), load a file with
flash and have the flash movie report the download speed to your script.

Jeff...what are your thoughts here in terms of a PHundamentals

Don't look at me man, I try to avoid e-commerce whenever possible as 
fiscal responsibility gives me the willies. But, collection of relevant 
facts (such as the card numbers), and an overview of the current 
packages free and otherwise would definitely be the kind of thing 
people on the list would like to see. Besides, as you well know, I'm 
more of a broad strokes visionary type, and wouldn't want to let any 
actual work cut into my beer time.

Doh!  <bright light in my face>

Not sure where I could help on this one as I have no experience with 
any commerce packages and my php skills are pretty rudimentary at the 
moment.  That said, be happy to contribute if you see an opportunity.  
:-)

Actually, this would be more suitable for the new AMPeers (which I think 
have not actually been publicly announced yet--but presumably will be 
shortly after tonight's Board meeting; John Lacey is the Project 
Manager).  AMPeers are articles written by members of the community on 
various subjects of interest--as opposed to PHundamentals, which are 
summaries of best practices, collected in response to an inquiry.

Oh a side note, you should have added the Luhn check digit algorithm
which can verify them before sending them off, it is a remarkably easy
algorithm.

It'd be funnier if they used transvestites/transgender to make the 
most of the "crossover" pun.

Heh. I get the feeling that the amount of freely available PHP code
snippets, utility libraries, classes etc has exploded in the past few
years along with PHP adoption. Once upon a time, a few years ago, I could
not even find a credit card validator in PHP so I stole and translated
Business::CreditCard from CPAN (Perl).

Guess you were looking in different places for it.

Yea, it is old school...
I wrote one on my TI-85 when I was in college.. circa 1994
It used that algorithm to generate numbers :) 
I spent a lot of time writing dumb programs for that calc..
