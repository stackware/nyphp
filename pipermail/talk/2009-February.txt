This post [1] mentions ~15 Firefox extensions for managing cookies --
but doesn't mention Web Developer [2] (which I think is a must-have
firefox extension).  Web Developer lets you create/read/update/delete
cookies.  Just posting this in case somebody out there is looking to
edit cookies in Firefox.

I'm sorry for all these stupid posts.  I'm in the middle of a learning
process.  It's always darkest before the dawn.

 

I see cookies are viewable and editable.

 

Does anyone know if any browsers allow the user to view and edit the request
Authorization?

 

If I hack the mod_auth_digest file to include mysql, which I haven't
verified is totally possible, yet, am I wasting my time.

 

Basic authorization isn't flexible enough.

 

What I want is to use AuthType in a secure fashion.

 

Does it work like that?

 

Is that stupid, too?

 

I'm not going to be using real Digest on my server, why does mod_auth_mysql
have to be Basic?

Absolutely _everything_ sent to the server can be edited in one way or 
another.  This includes things such as, but not limited to, user agents, 
cookies, auth information, form submissions, request URIs.

I was looking a phpinfo().  It lists the header info.

I'm reading an article that the browser typically stores the realm.

Why can I not see this in phpinfo()?  Is it in the request authorization or
not?  

When the browser popups up the authentication window it lists the realm.

you could use HTTPS and a simple form for authentication...that would be
transparent to PHP and could implement a secure solution for logging users
in, i am not sure if this is what you need

You have to assume that everything being transmitted by the browser
can be modified.

For example, there is a tool called "Burp Proxy" that allows you to
intercept regular browser communication, modify it in some way such as
by adding or removing a header like a cookie and then sending the
modified request to the real target. This is the sort of thing that
hackers use to find holes in web applications.

I'm not really sure what you're trying to do but usually
authentication is built into the application where possible because
then you have control over how passwords are stored, managed and you
have script level access to user information and associated groups and
preferences. If you use mod_auth_something, you're just putting a gate
in front of a directory and you have limited your account management
options. Those modules are for throwing up protection in front of
existing applications that cannot easily be modified. If you're
writing something new in PHP that is quite the opposite case.

IMO everyone storing passwords in a database should associate them
with accounts and use a standard hashing method. For example, a very
common method is a base 64 salted SHA which is computed in PHP as
follows:

  $salt = substr(md5(mt_rand(), true), 0, 4);
  $ctx = hash_init('sha1');
  hash_update($ctx, $password);
  hash_update($ctx, $salt);
  $hash = hash_final($ctx, true);
  return '{SSHA}' . base64_encode($hash . $salt);

This will give you an ASCII based string like:

  {SSHA}7d819b5bab847634b091211de1ee6c587634

Put this whole string in the DB (including the {SSHA}). To validate a
password you need to retrieve the above hash string, base64 decode it,
extract the salt from the end, compute the hash and compare that to
the begging of the hahs. This method is strong because it's salted and
uses SHA and uses a standard hashing method which allows you to
transfer the passwords to other storages that are more likely to
understand them such that you don't need to have users change their
passwords after the transfer. Another developer can take one look at
the hash string and know exactly how to compute it.

This is how I would do it anyway. Most people actually invent their
own password storage method reasoning that the obscurity of it adds a
level of protection. That logic is incorrect.

    Digest authentication doesn't really work because the different 
browser and server vendors never achieved interoperability.

    If you're worried about transmissions being intercepted,  use SSL.  
Both Apache 2 and IIS have SSL built in,  so it's straightforward to 
implement.  You can spend as much as you like on an SSL certificate,  
but you can get them cheap from godaddy or sign them yourself for 
internal products with no budget.

    Note that sites like yahoo,  google,  amazon,  twitter,  ebay,  and 
digg don't use Basic Auth,  Digest Auth or any of the Auth systems built 
into the http standard.  They use the unofficial standard that's 
described in the following paper:

Can someone direct me to a apache forum other than
http://httpd.apache.org/lists.html.  I gotten no response.

I modified mod_auth_digest to use mysql and crypt, but the crypt symbol is
undefined when I try to restart apache.

I configured httpd with ./configure  --enable-modules=all
--enable-mods-shared=all --enable-so --with-included-apr

I modified config_var.mk MOD_AUTH_DIGEST_LDADD with -lm -lz -luuid -lrt
-lcrypt

Still crypt is undefined.  I can seem to properly link in crypt.  I include
#include <unistd.h> and <crypt.h> 

/usr/lib/mysql is in the ld.so.conf whereas /usr/lib is not.  Randomly
adding it in doesn't seem to work.

I've set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_RUN_PATH environment variable to
/usr/lib.

I'm at my wits end.

This is the apxs -i -a -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -L/usr/lib -luuid -lrt
-lcrypt -lz -lm -c mod_auth_digest.c output.

I also tried generating it as part of a httpd compile.

   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable

     during execution

   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable

   - use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag

   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

This looks like a fun paper (the WSJ.com hack is forehead smacking
funny). But from looking at it briefly, I'm a little confused. It's
all about using cookie authenticators but it doesn't explain why one
would use cookie authenticators. My understanding is that cookie
authenticators are mostly only useful for allowing the authentication
state to persist across visits. Otherwise, you wouldn't need to use
cookies at all - you could just store the authenticator in the HTTP
session on the server. From a security perspective, cookies can be
sniffed just like session ids so there's not a great benefit there.
But the paper also has a section that says "do not use persistent
cookies" since another user on the system could copy the cookie and
gain access to your account but that would completely defeat the
purpose of using cookie authenticators as it would be easier to simply
use a server side authenticator.

It seems to me, if you want persistent authentication, cookie
authenticators must persist. And the only real benefit they provider
in terms of security is that session ids can be leaked in URLs whereas
cookies cannot (minus browser bugs that allow stealing cookies).

Are client side cookie authenticators really more *secure* than server
side session authenticators? Or do cookie authenticators actually
reduce security but are used anyway because persistent authentication
is a required user experience feature?

What are you actually trying to do?  I doubt you need to hack Apache modules
to accomplish whatever it is.

There are modules to authenticate against a MySQL database.  Check out the
module listings for Apache.

But, seeing as this is a PHP list, you probably should use PHP/MySQL
together, which can do the authentication for you... like it does for
millions of other web sites.

I want to check the Authorization header for the realm.  Can't do that with
Basic Authentication, because realm is not defined in that case.

There is one that authenticates against mysql.  It's called mod_auth_mysql.
But, it uses Basic authentication, which is insufficient.

Hacking the mod_auth_digest module was a simple process.  I simply switch
the actual user and password verification from the file to the database.
Who knows.  Maybe, it will be a new trend.  :-)  I left all of the nce stuff
in place.  But I can not get it to link to the standard library crypt for
some reason.  This is the biggest compilation problem I've ever had.  I've
tried everything I could think of, except apr_password_validate(sent_pw,
real_pw) instead of crypt.  Duh.  That should work.

I do use PHP_AUTH_USER for some stuff, just not this.  The site is a combo
of php, mysql, javascript, html, css and htaccess.

Plus, I'm dying to see if my modifications will fly.  If it works, it will
be pretty nifty.

I'm going to try that function now.

    Four things.

     (1) The server has to give the browser something to connect the 
browser to a particular server side session.  This either going to be a 
cookie or it's going to be a token in the URL or maybe it's going to be 
private data in a flash or silverlight app. 

    (2) Server-side sessions have all sorts of problems.  The details 
depend on your language,  but there's always a devil in them.  For 
instance,  there's a global lock on PHP sessions that hurts the 
scalability of PHP apps that use sessions.  ASP.NET,  on the other 
hand,  dumps the session jar on the floor whenever the server has a 
glitch or when the .NET assemblies from the sites are reloaded.  This is 
why imeem.com logs me out two to three times a day:  it's fair to say 
that I think about joining another music site every time that that happens.

    (3) Server-side session mechanisms are also bound to a particular 
environment:  in the real world,  organizations often need to work with 
multiple languages:  it's quite possible to use signed cookies to 
authenticate against applications in PHP,  Java,  Perl,  Ruby,  Cold 
Fusion and ASP.NET.  (I've done it)  A decent implementation is about 
100 lines of code.

    (4) Signed cookies scale,  since you don't need to look at a 
database to validate them.

>   
   You have to look at the details.  The signed cookie system described 
in that paper can be analyzed on it's own.  A security analysis of a 
system based on say PHP or ASP.NET sessions requires an analysis of the 
session mechanism.  A one-line code change in the session system in a 
future version of your platform could break the security of the system 
without you even noticing it.  Systems that put a token in the URL can 
be manipulated:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation

    Since mainstream server-based sessions are passing some token in the 
clear,  sessions can be stolen by packet sniffing.  You can certainly 
use some cryptography powered by Javascript or Silverlight or something 
to defeat certain packet sniffing attacks,  but public key methods need 
some kind of trusted authority to defend against man-in-the-middle 
attacks.  That's what SSL certificates should provide -- and you should 
be using SSL if this is a concern.

------------

    Another issue that you're talking about is the "remember me" option 
that we see on a lot of public facing sites.  Amazon.com is a good 
example,  because they support different kinds of activities:  (i) 
community and (ii) commerce.  Community sites really need "remember me" 
to be viable.  If I had to log into facebook every time I got an e-mail 
saying that a friend tagged a photo of me,  I wouldn't do it.  Amazon 
lets you use the low-security functions of the site with a remembered 
token,  but forces you to type your password to do anything that's 
security sensitive.

    "Remember me" is generally done by generating a random token in the 
database,  putting it in a cookie,  and checking the cookie against a 
database -- if there is a match,  you create a cryptographically signed 
session.  The database lookup is required because you need the ability 
to revoke a token when a user wants to "log out".

Subject: [nycphp-talk] large file uploads with cgi php
Message-ID: <49876096.9060902@nyphp.com>

I have a site on a shared host where PHP is running as a CGI. I
need to allow file uploads larger than the default 7M.

The host tells me that I can create a local php.ini with the
appropriate settings and a wrapper that execs the system
php5.cgi, and then in .htaccess add php5-cgi as a php handler,
with a pointer to the wrapper. I did all this but the effect is
that no pre-processing at all is going on.

Does anybody have ideas about (1) what I might do as an
alternative (short of changing hosts), or (2) what might be wrong
with the way I'm trying to do this (I am admittedly flying
near-blind here)?

Ahh yes, good old nested sets.  I still prefer the hybrid approach I
took with phpGACL (http://phpgacl.sf.net) and my old clew demo that
stores both both adjacency and nsm data.

For a very small storage overhead you get the benefits of both
approaches (try pulling immediate children from an nsm tree) and the
ability to rebuild the nsm data from scratch if it gets especially
messed up (not that there would ever be bugs...).

I've been meaning to sit down and try to figure out a variation using
intervals between the lft and rgt values so that inserts are cheaper,
just haven't had a project that needed it enough to motivate me yet!

If anyone wants to pick apart my old implementations feel free to check
out http://clew.phpwerx.net/, the source code is linked at the bottom.

Are you sure about that?  AFAIK short_open_tag off will prevent using
that syntax.  You can turn it on in your custom php.ini.

We use left+right+parentId, so that immediate children are easy to find.

It works pretty well to bulk-insert a bunch of empty nodes and then
use them up as you go (to cut down on insert time). That's not going
to be a good solution if your inserts are really spread out all over
the tree, but in the apps I've built so far the majority of inserts
happen at just a few nodes. Cron can be used to keep a ready supply of
fresh nodes in those locations, and you take nearly the same
performance hit whether you insert one or 50.

If you use NSM, definitely write a test script that bulks up the tree
so you can see what performance is like with 50k nodes vs. 500k nodes.
You're going to notice, and you need to be prepared for it.

Some kind of interval-based partitioning will probably be necessary if
you need to run on a standard server with > 100k nodes, or if you are
going to try to catch a lot of inserts at the same time.

Thanks for compiling the list.

Thought it was a little silly at first, but now that you have
responded with the compiled list, I am glad you asked.

Hi!

Found by accident that our local museum and planetarium uses PHP as well:
http://www.schenectadymuseum.org/
Best to see when one clicks on the planetarium link.

Or another museum on the other side of the Mohawk:
http://www.esam.org/

And how could I forget the support page I made years ago for Ingersoll-Rand / 
Schlage. My replacements made some changes to it, but it uses PHP for the search:
http://irsupport.net/


HTH,

David

I don't know if you're just looking just for public web sites but the 
Transportation and Referral Management Systems (TRMS) I built for them 
is rolling out to all 17 CHF programs around the country.  It's PHP5 + 
PostgreSQL.  I'm about to start a new one for childhood diabetes.

Hi!

I 'found' another one, this time a for-profit corporation and a Microsoft 
DotNet Showcase Company. MadCap Software uses PHP to run their support forum 
(which is phpBB) at http://forums.madcapsoftware.com

One of these cases where I look at it every day and just don't register that 
it is PHP. As a disclaimer (no clue if it is needed), I am a MadCap MVP and 
MAD certified (not certified mad!).

Guys,

 

It totally works!

Am I the first to write mod_auth_digest/mysql?

If anyone ever wants to use it, be my guest.  There will be one condition

though.  You have to know c and return the module slightly more graceful.

I really don't have time to piddle around with this anymore.

It's not my most beautiful work, but it's sound.

I haven't programmed in c since 12/00.

I was to add Opaque to the implementation, but I'm not sure it's in use by
the browsers.

 

Michele

Michelle,
I don't have the time or inclination to go refactoring C code that works,
but I'll gladly make a sourceforge project and see if I can improve the docs
or build process.

I do know enough C to avoid it in favor of a language with a garbage
collector, so if you have some specific improvement I could make without too
much effort I'll give those a go.

Say the word pick a license and I'll make a sourceforge project.

Regards,

Justin Dearing

Here are few facts that make your statement somewhat ironic:

 1. PHP is basically just a wrapper around C and C libraries

 2. PHP is written in C

 3. PHP does not have garbage collection

I like the syntax of C. I don't like having to malloc memory.

PHP may not have a garbage collector, but I don't have to manually
deallocate memory for the most part. Of course I still have to connect and
disconnect from the database manually, and scrub sql parameters, but its
easier to avoid mistakes in those two situations then you do with malloc and
free.

Yes it does.  That's what the various gc_* php.ini settings are for:

Doh!  Those are for session garbage collection.  None the less, PHP does 
have garbage collection.

Php uses simple reference counts, and the counters are updated
continuously.  I take garbage collection to mean there is a periodic
process where unreachable objects are found and deleted.  There is no
periodic garbage collection in php.  Memory is freed as soon as the
reference count goes to zero.

Not really. But it wouldn't be hard to split some hairs in this conversation.

My understanding is that true "garbage collection" doesn't immediately
free objects when they fall out of scope or when they're set to nil
but rather maintains table references that can be used to periodically
figure out how to efficiently free things later. Usually there's a
background process that does this in a way that allows programs to
"run wild" but then free things when the CPU becomes idle or if free
memory runs low.

I'm not an expert on this stuff so my description is probably
oversimplified but PHP does not do the above. It just frees everything
as soon as it's unset. Or maybe it waits to some degree but I don't
think there's a sophisticated algorithm behind it, it doesn't maintain
a separate table of allocations (the zvals and resources *are* the
allocation table) and it doesn't use a separate process to do any of
this. GC has never been a really high priority since PHP scripts are
usually fairly short lived.

An important implication of this is that I would imagine if you tried
to write a long-lived PHP script that did a lot of work like a CLI
script run from cron, you'd find the script would behave poorly after
a while and may even just run out of memory entirely if you didn't
aggressively unset() things. With proper GC that would not happen.

I have written PHP extensions and to do that you need to know how
things are allocated internally. There are two types of memory objects
- zvals and resources. The zvals are used to represent arrays,
objects, variable length data (strings), integers and doubles. Since
you can completely traverse a zval and all descendants, PHP can
automatically delete the entire tree when the root zval is unset().
Resources are managed by extensions and have deconstructors that are
responsible for freeing all memory associated with them. These are
used for things like file handles, database connections, drawing
contexts and so on. If you unset a resource it fires the deconstructor
which must explicitily go through and free any memory that has been
allocated by the resource.

My instinct is that PHP probably does delay deallocation of things
that are unset for a short time reasoning that the script will
probably complete by the time it needs to actually free things. But
that's pure speculation on my part. It just seems like a smart thing
to do. Then again, if you unset() something and then look at
memory_get_usage it shows the memory has been deallocated (although it
could just be lying or call the "collection" routine first).

Again, I'm not an expert on this so I've probably trampled some truth
in a message this size. But I know for sure that it is not accurate to
say that "PHP uses garbage collection".

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Definitely A Digest Request bug in IE
Message-ID: <20090204003057.WSVP8681.hrndva-omta05.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

This can't possibly be the way a request should work.

Don't try this at home.

If this is misinformation, my apologies in advanced, but I've tested it out
like 30 times using the originally install http on my server.

 

When I was just testing my variation of mod_auth_digest, I found IE 7 may
have a bug or odd behavior.

 

The first time it requests login.php in one realm, it's fine.

The first times requests logoff.php in another realm, it's fine.

The second time it requests login.php, it uses the user name and realm from
logoff.php in the request instead of the user name for login.php which is in
the dialog box by default.  Typing it in doesn't make a difference.

When the authorization fails and the user re-enters his/her info, it sends
another request with the correct user name and realm, but this time it
doesn't recognize the response from http.

It prompts a third time for good measure.

You can go back to the logoff.php page without authorization.

 

I'm going round and round with this.

 

I tested out the original mod_auth_digest file in IE, changing from realm to
realm with that module produced the same problem as I was seeing in my
variation.

 

I was using:

 

<Files login.php>

   AuthType Digest

   AuthName "login"

   AuthUserFile /path/.htpasswd

   AuthDigestDomain https://domain/account/

   require valid-user

</Files>

<Files logoff.php>

   AuthType Digest

   AuthName "logoff"

   AuthUserFile /path/.htpasswd

   AuthDigestDomain https://domain/account/

   require valid-user

</Files>

 

The contents of login.php and logoff.php are <?php phpinfo(); ?>

.htpassword contains two users of the appropriate realm created with
.htdigest.

In ie,

I request login.php

I request logoff.php

I request login.php, boom, two 3 dialog boxes and fails authorization.

I request logoff.php, it displays.

 

I'm going to try to find a work around for this.

Anyone interested is welcome to try this little test out or explain to me
this is how digest works.

I know what's in the actual request values because I printed them out from
mod_auth_digest.

In Firefox, this is not the behavior.  Each previously logged into page
can't be viewed.

I would prefer re-authenication every time the realm is changed for the same
AuthDigestDomain.

It sets the first realm for the domain.  When you log into another page in a
different realm in the same domain, it doesn't change the realm.  Other
subsequent page requests are made with the initial realm plus you have to
get the user name from $_SERVER["PHP_AUTH_DIGEST"] because
$_SERVER[AUTH_USER_NAME] isn't set.  Arrggghh!

 

My stinking changes to make mod_auth_digest work with mysql worked.
Unfortunately, mod_auth_digest seems to not be implemented correctly on the
browsers.

Message-ID: <20090204005159.BAVP9335.hrndva-omta03.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

Safari doesn't even set the digest realm for subsequent page calls in the
domain.

Opera doesn't appear to have implemented digest.

This would be such a clean, simple security implementation.  It would be
sweet if they get the bugs out and all implement it the same way.

Shouldn't it be one protocol for communicating with the server?  Or is it
just me?

If I have any input when there are two realms defined for the same domain it
would switch to the new realm after log in.  This is a key point.

Seriously, this design is simple and easy to implement for account security.
Only problem is is that the browsers don't work or work the same.

If anyone has any influence on this matter, please, tell them they need to
fix digest.

I don't know how I'm going to handle this or what I'm going to tell my
client.  "It's not my program.  It's the browsers"?

Message-ID: <20090204014553.ZADF8681.hrndva-omta05.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

One small redeeming factor is firefox completely logs you out of digest with
an incorrect password.

 

I hope it flys in ajax.

 

I can use clearauthenticationcache in IE and not worry about the bug.

 

That leave safari which is supposed to log you out but doesn't seem to.

 

Opera that doesn't seem to implement it.

 

There's still a bug in IE.

Um did the baby get thrown out with the bathwater? I think a lot of
people want to see this module go mainstream.

Here is an interesting article on memory management:

(it is excerpted from Sara Goleman's book 'Extending and Embedding PHP' )

Also  zend_gc.h and zend_gc.c are of interest

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Compared to Cold Fusion
Message-ID: <006901c987c1$8085cca0$819165e0$@com>

Good Day All:

Can anyone in their long experience of coding in numerous languages
enumerate some of the pros and cons of Cold Fusion (CF, CFML) especially
when compared to PHP.

My basic thoughts are that CF:
1) is more expensive to program ($$ per hr. pd. to programmer)
2) not as simply and totally extensible as PHP  
3) expensive special server side software to invest in
4) CF hosting more expensive per mo.
5) almost no heavy usage sites use CF (i.e. CNN, Facebook, BBC)
6) more expensive to maintain, update or add on to code
 
Anybody got other techie reasons why CF would pale compared to PHP say
in raw speed, etc.

Thanks in advance.

Warmest regards,

Raw speed, heh.

The list of extensions, both integrated and pecl, puts PHP way out in
front of CF in terms of versatility and functionality.

Hey,

We are moving away from CF. Finding talent is difficult, and what can be 
done in CF
can be done CLEANER in a different languages. I'm speaking to the <tag 
this <tag that
syntax.

CF does have some nice PDF abilities and has been using "binded" queries 
for a long time.

It is more $ because of the cf server - Hey Peter, sounds like we're 
doing research for your proposal! -= ]

My first toe in of a sales pitch is already over. 

In this SW Florida area where I am there is a surprising amount of CFM
in dynamic web sites. And, then a surprising amount of .NET.

I have to tell you, the area is very uninformed about opensource. In my
initial discussions with people regarding opensource (PHP) vs. CF and
.NET they are even seemingly disbelieving that there could be anything
as good and value intensive as opensource. 

That is why I am looking for quality corp. name users of PHP to put some
indirect big third party endorsement behind my pitch. 

I don?t mind informing people about opensource, but I really did not
want to appear some new fangled St. John preaching the near miraculous. 

But any further info on the downsides of CFM would still help me in the
long run.

Hey,

We are moving away from CF. Finding talent is difficult, and what can be

done in CF
can be done CLEANER in a different languages. I'm speaking to the <tag

CF does have some nice PDF abilities and has been using "binded" queries

It is more $ because of the cf server - Hey Peter, sounds like we're

Hey Peter,

I'm prefacing this by saying I love PHP and it is my language of choice, but I also have extensive experience with ColdFusion and I don't feel like all your statements about it are completely accurate (also playing devil's advocate a bit :) ).

1) From my experience, ColdFusion development is typically faster than PHP development, so even though it costs more per hour it can end up being less hours of development time. In a similar way, someone who hires the cheapest PHP developer could end up spending more than hiring a more expensive PHP developer due to the speed and quality of work.
2) A lot of the selling point of CF is that you aren't meant to extend it. It should inherently have what you need already. Although this is not the case 100% of the time I think they do a pretty good job of offering a lot of things that you have to extend PHP for (CAPTCHA and PDF creation/manipulation are a couple that come to mind immediately).
3) Although ColdFusion costs to be on a server, it offers a lot of monitoring information. With ColdFusion Enterprise you can also restart separate server instances (thus not having to take all your sites down for server reboot).
4) True
5) A few high traffic sites (www.senate.gov, http://www.dsireusa.org/i, http://www.energystar.gov, http://www.economist.com, http://www.mayoclinic.com/). Also, MySpace was on CF for a while.
6) This is completely dependent on what your app does, I can think of many instances where CF updates and maintenance on a site are quicker and much less expensive. I can think of situations where PHP is quicker and less expensive. 

PHP definitely handles the huge loads better than ColdFusion, and it's something to consider when building an app but I also think it's important to give all languages a fair look. 

Thanks!
Ricky

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Compared to Cold Fusion

Good Day All:

Can anyone in their long experience of coding in numerous languages
enumerate some of the pros and cons of Cold Fusion (CF, CFML) especially
when compared to PHP.

My basic thoughts are that CF:
1) is more expensive to program ($$ per hr. pd. to programmer)
2) not as simply and totally extensible as PHP  
3) expensive special server side software to invest in
4) CF hosting more expensive per mo.
5) almost no heavy usage sites use CF (i.e. CNN, Facebook, BBC)
6) more expensive to maintain, update or add on to code
 
Anybody got other techie reasons why CF would pale compared to PHP say
in raw speed, etc.

Thanks in advance.

Warmest regards,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] CFM Downsides from Wikipedia CFM Article
Message-ID: <007a01c987c7$176386d0$462a9470$@com>

Technical commentary

IT commentators have offered various critiques of ColdFusion, discussing
both the potential advantages and disadvantages of this technology
relative to other alternatives.

    * Bootstrapping: ColdFusion is not a general purpose programming
language. It cannot be used to create certain kinds of programs or
software. For example, ColdFusion was written in Java and it would be
impossible to write ColdFusion in ColdFusion itself (a technique known
as Bootstrapping). Extending ColdFusion therefore frequently relies on
also using other general purpose programming languages.
    * Cost: Adobe ColdFusion is expensive compared to some of its
competitors, which are almost always free. Even Microsoft-based
solutions such as ASP.NET are technically free if you own a PC or server
running some version of Windows. For developers who do not wish to host
their own site (and personally purchase ColdFusion Server), shared
hosting accounts are readily available at comparable prices to PHP or
ASP.NET hosting. Note, ColdFusion is free for Academic use.
    * Extensions: ColdFusion libraries and extensions are not always
free, although there are sites dedicated to open-source ColdFusion code
and several open-source frameworks have emerged in recent years in
active development. ColdFusion can call Java libraries which alleviates
this issue.
    * OOP: ColdFusion lacks advanced object-oriented features [6] such
as providing little distinction between instance and class (virtual and
static) properties and methods. ColdFusion doesn't offer constructor
syntax per se, but rather forces an object factory pattern to return
object instances. A common idiom is to use init to indicate a method
which is the constructor for each component. Methods are implicitly
virtual if they reference the THIS scope. There are several techniques
available to provide mixin functionality.
    * Open Source: Some competing scripting languages such as PHP, Ruby,
Perl and Python are open-source. Although the language of CFML itself is
documented, Adobe ColdFusion's server code is not viewable or
modifiable. However, SmithProject and the J2EE version of BlueDragon
(OpenBD) are open-source CFML parsing engines.
    * Shared hosting: Certain features of ColdFusion such as event
gateways, creation of datasources, caching settings and classpath
additions are not readily configurable for usage in a shared hosting
environment.[7] ColdFusion 7 introduced the Admin API which allows
hosting providers to automate things such as datasource creation for
their customers.
    * Scripting: CFScript is similar to but incompatible with the
ECMAScript specification. ColdFusion does include some server-side
Actionscript functionality, however ColdFusion's server-side
Actionscript has significantly fewer features than CFML. Note: The
release of CF 8 brought CFscript closer to ECMA by introducing == for
equals, < for less than, and ++ etc.
    * Syntax: CFML syntax is very different from traditional programming
languages, which use a C-style syntax, although this is a key reason for
its success.

Well I am working at my second primarily.NET shop that was originally a
coldfusion shop. One went through a classic asp phase first though. So its
not a surprising combinations of technologies to know as it seems to have
been a standard progression.

Well how informed are you about .NET or even mono? Most people know a
handful of technologies. I've done PHP, .NET, vb6 and dabbled in a few other
languages. I've made minor edits to CF pages and I assume I'm grossly
uninformed about it. I know a former foxpro programmer that could convince
you it was one of the greatest development environments ever. Had I not
known him I would never believe foxpro was a "real" programming tool.

All,

We're considering working with the PHP QA group and supporting a Test Fest
event, both in the virtual world, and the real-world of NYC.

Here are overviews:

http://qa.php.net/testfest.php - the What
http://wiki.php.net/qa/testfest - the How

Getting involved with this would greatly benefit PHP itself, as well as hone
your own skills working in a QA testing environment (it's great for a
resume).

At this point, I'm interested in:

-- hearing general thoughts on this type of thing and how it could come
together in NYC

-- how many people would be interested in doing the testing?

-- how many people would be interested in helping to organize?

Let's discuss on this list to get public feedback, or feel free to contact
me off-list if you'd like to chat directly.

Best,

I know a guy that's managing a company running on CF and he very much 
wishes that he had gone with PHP or even Python. The availability of 
developers to work with CF is much more limited.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mod_auth_digest/mysql
Message-ID: <20090205223923.YEMO9192.hrndva-smta02.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

Guys,

 

The site's going live around 8p.m. using the variation of mod_auth_digest
authenticating against mysql, that I wrote/modified, today.

Pretty exciting.  I didn't disturb its general behavior.  It still behaves
like mod_auth_digest.

And the browsers, well, they still behave like they do too.

I'm only using IE and FF for account access.  You can still view the public
pages on the other browsers.

I sent an email to Opera and I'm sending one to Safari.  Opera doesn't log
in with ajax and Safari doesn't log out.

Anyway, no one ever answered my question.  Am I the first to write
mod_auth_mysql/digest?

In a couple of weeks after my vacation, I'm going to play around with it
some more.  Getting the password from httpd.conf was an issue.

I wanted it working, so I temporarily cut my loses.

I have one pressing htaccess issue.  I'm thinking about joining
webmasterworld.com.  Anyone have a subscription?  Should I pay to use the
forum?

I'm thinking about hacking httpd again.

They have rewritemod -f, is file, -d is directory, but not -n, variable does
not exist.  I'm thinking about adding it.  It looks like a variable not
existing always evaluates to true, so using REMOTE_USER is a problem to test
if the user is logged in.  Unfortunately, even after logout the
authorization contain the realm on backpage.  I couldn't find away for
REMOTE_USER to be always defined even if no one is logged in.  I think it
would be nice like Apache addition.  Shouldn't be too hard to implement.
Check for the flag, see if the variable exists, return true or false.  It
will work nicely with mod_auth_digest.  Keep those pesky login dialogs from
popping up on backpage, hopefully.

 

I want to implement this little tidbit:

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REMOTE_USER} -n

RewriteRule ^.*$ http://domain/path/logged_out.html [R]

 

This doesn't work when remote_user is not defined.  It seems to always
evaluate to true:

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REMOTE_USER} !=""

RewriteRule ^.*$ - [S=1]

RewriteRule ^.*$ http:// domain/path/logged_out.html [R]

 

You put the actual logging authtype stuff below this segment.

Once I get it tight and the browsers get on board.  Some folks doing smaller
sized websites may want to check it out.  Ajax is not necessary.  One guy
said it isn't good for login in case if craps out, but it's over a ssl, so
I'm not that worried.  Should I be?  Plus, I put too much freaking work into
the ajax implementation to turn back now.  The reason I went mod_auth_digest
was cause totally hinging on cookies for account security was freaking me
out and I was doing that with mod_auth_basic.  I use php for security mostly
outside the account, but very little inside.  I know more misinformation and
a whole lot of vagueness.

I'm going to turn my websites into Fort Knox, if it kills me.

 

Michele

Sure thing.  My hind sight was wrong.  I definitely needed this
implementation.  I can?t log out in ajax with basic.  I always second guess
myself.  Keeps me in check.

 

Good news for you guys.  I?m taking vacation to recuperate from the 15-18
hour days I?ve been working on and off over the last 2 ? months.  I should
be posting for at least a month.

BTW: 

 

Guys,

 

I?m drinking now.  Final post before taking vacation.  Yeahhhhhh!  My first
major website.  I did a Zencart before, but never homespun like this.  I,
typically, modify E. Indian made websites.

 

My implementation is a spin on:

http://www.berenddeboer.net/rest/authentication.html

 

There?s a Opera and Safari kink to iron out.  So, they are not working.

 

Because I can?t use this implementation without validating the account
before login in with ajax, I use php session variables for security outside
the account.  It validates the user has correctly answered captchas and
security question and validates the security question id is correct before
responding the login information is valid.  I use this on all pages trying
to login or send email to reduce the chances of robots getting anywhere.

 

However, once inside I only use that approach when modifying the user?s
info.  The rest depends entirely on mod_auth_digest/mysql, my version.  That
means I don?t have to modify every single php file with authentication
checks.

 

I hooked up with a guy on the apache mailing list that gave me the final
piece of the puzzle to prevent login dialog popups.

 

I know I followed a lot of wrong tangents at points and people may think I?m
lost, but it?s tight now.

 

If you don?t have one million hits a day, once opera and safari get on
board, I welcome you to check it out.

 

Yeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  I?m done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Going

Sure thing.  My hind sight was wrong.  I definitely needed this

Good news for you guys.  I?m taking vacation to recuperate from the 15-18

Search for "rbl lookup". There are a number of web utilities to check 
your ip's. They're all pretty good.
If you are running your own mail servers, you will know pretty quickly 
if you are blacklisted by monitoring the queue and seeing the emails 
back up. To prevent that, I would recommend pro actively submitting 
whitelist requests for your ip range(s) to the big hosts like aol, 
yahoo, etc.  Unfortunately, some providers (ahem.. COMCAST).. are less 
responsive to your requests and there isn't much that can be done about 
it.   If you are serious about reliable mass email, then you'll want to 
set up mail relays at a number of different hosts around the internet so 
that if and when your server does get blacklisted, you can route the 
rest of your mail through a clean relay.

That's probably true of many programming languages. However, I think you'd 
have a bigger pool to select good PHP programmers from than the pool for 
CF.

To be fair, I see CF as similar to a framework. After all, its written in 
Java right?

The fact that MySpace moved away from CF speaks volumes.

Hi!

Came across this article in InformationWeek. It is about IBM and Zend porting 
PHP to IBM's System i hardware aimed at small business and Fortune 500 (which 
means mom & pop shops and huge corporations?? Doesn't make sense to me, but 
maybe I misunderstand). Seems as if PHP will give Java some competition. 
Interesting read...and apologies if this is old news to you.

I don't know if you've ever worked with an AS/400 (I did in some college
classes back in 98 - 00 with COBOL and RPG) it's very powerful and in use by
a LOT of government/industrial companies -- as the article states. The
Series i replaces the AS/400 (side-note:Zend has offered Series i downloads
for a while now, at least for its IDE) and at the risk of sounding like a
little fanboy... this is fantastic news for PHP and PHP programmers over
all.

People with COBOL/RPG and PHP experience will be able to pull in a
*nice*paycheck converting programs or building web-based front-ends to
interface
with those programs.

better start exercising program logic muscles again...

Hi!

Since I am a QA professional I am interested in it, but being in Sc'dy and the 
event taking place in NYC distance comes in the way. Besides that, we are 
short before a release at work and I currently are over my head in system 
tests while spending my sparse amounts of time at home on a book translation 
that was planned to be done by the end of last December. So time comes in the 
way as well at least for assisting in organizing it. Attending is a different 
issue, but that is influenced by date and time of the event as well as 
personal funding (NYC isn't a half hour drive and if it is in Manhattan, 
Brooklyn, or Queens I won't drive my car there).

In my case it is the same reasons why I only appear on this mailing list and 
don't attend the UG meetings, but in neither case it is because of desinterest.

David

Hi Hans:

This could be a fun event.

$community = $people + $food + $beer;
$better_php = $tests = $computers + $community;

I saw the posting on internals and was interested in helping organize a 
local event.  Glad others are thinking similarly.

Message-ID: <EF0605FC343F204C9F5A8771CC09B22B887979@pe2800.wlabs.local>

About a year ago NYPHP created a captcha form for our website.  The html
has undergone quite a few changes.  Unfortunately in that process we've
lost some function...when a user submits the form, forgetting a required
field, the session is lost; on the redirect the data that was input by
the user is gone.  Needing some guidance as to how to fix this.  Help
please?
 
thanks!

Carry the session id along as a get variable in the redirect, something 
like this:
header( 'Location: somewhere.php?PHPSESSID=' . session_id() );

You are talking about two potential situations.

1) The session isn't being maintained between pages.
2) The posted data isn't passed along on the redirect.

The first issue can be due to one or more scripts missing the 
session_start() call at the top.  Or there is other output before the 
session_start() call so the session cookie isn't being set properly (you 
may be not seeing the error message because you have display_errors off, 
so look at your error_log.

The second issue is expected.  The HTTP POST goes to the initial page.  
When you're redirecting to another page, that's a whole new GET request 
unrelated to the initial POST request.

Probably best to determine the problem first. The Location header  
requires an absolute URL, and the way you've just used it results in a  
lost session on some older versions of IE. (IE correctly determines  
the host for the request, but it fails to include cookies for that  
host.) So, passing along the session identifier in the URL can correct  
this problem, but it's a poor solution.

Christina, do you have LiveHTTPHeaders for Firefox or something like  
it? If we could see the HTTP transaction in question, I'm sure the  
problem will reveal itself.

Chris

Also, upon calling a script that is dependent on the session make sure that 
the session is picked up again before doing anything else. I use redirects 
frequently (back when I had time to code) and typically did this:

Script A
session_write_close
redirect to Script B

Script B
Session_start

I found that the session_write_close wasn't always necessary, but a few tests 
turned up that variables were still written to the file while the redirect 
already completed. The session_start is then always the first line of code to 
get executed, even before initializing variables, including files, or doing 
anything else.

My approach relies in cookies being set for passing the session_id along. I 
guess the more solid approach is to go with what Michael proposed. I am sure 
that when you use both approaches session data will be preserved and will 
remain available.

Alternatively, anything that is stored in a session can also be stored 
temporarily on the server. You can create your own random IDs and start 
stuffing data into database tables or flat files. That may have other 
disadvantages. I find session handling in PHP to be very convenient, almost 
too convenient as one is tempted to load all kinds of crap into the session 
and piggyback it through all scripts.

Hi Michael,
 
on the processing page after the form array is verified and email
address is validated,
 
the code goes like this:
 
 
if ($_POST) {
    
        // save post into a cookie to retrieve later - careful with
captcha fields, do not restore those in interface
        
        setcookie("form", serialize($_POST), time()+300);
 
        if (captcha::check()) {
                if (verify_form($required, $_POST)) {
    //follow the same structure as verify form.  So now, if the form is
verified, we continue. Otherwise we will error out with redirect
    if ( (validate_email($email)) ) {
 
   // redirect to this url on full success and email form
                        header('Location:
http://www.wll.com/thankyou.shtml');
   $_POST['RemoteIP'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
                        mail_form(SENDER, RECIPIENT, SUBJECT, $_POST);
                } else {
          // If not validate email;
            header('Location: ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);
           } 
        } else {
      // If verify form failed
         header('Location: ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);
       }
       exit;
       } else {
        // if not capture
         $_SESSION["error"] = 'Verification word does not match';
        header('Location: ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);
       }
       exit;
} else {
   // if no $_POST variable
   if ($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS['form']) {
   //$form array can be used to set form field values
   // this server sucks, need to remove added slashes
   $form = unserialize(stripslashes($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS['form']));
 
   // destroy cookie on client side
   setcookie('form', '');
  }
  // echo $captcha puts captcha anywhere in the interface
         $captcha = captcha::form("&rarr;&nbsp;");
 }

 

Back on the page containing the form, a block of code linking session
"error" to the data array 

if ($_SESSION["error"]) {
    echo '<font color="red">' . $_SESSION["error"] . '</font>';
    unset($_SESSION["error"]);
   }
 

and reference to the required form data is tucked away:   

 <form action="quote.php" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="print_blank_fields" value="1">
        <!--<input type=hidden name="sort" value="order:Contact
Name,Company,Street,City,State,Zip Code,email,Phone,Fax,EMC Compliance
Testing,Product Safety,Educational Seminars,Site
Surveys,Telecom,Wireless Approvals,Consulting and EMC Specialties, PCS
Site Surveys,Other,Comments">-->
        <center>


 

So i understand that session error shows which required field was not
entered by the user... but, what happens to the session vars with the
form data?

Hi Christina:

Before I get into specific code feedback, you REALLY need to get some 
coding standards in place.  Your nesting is a total mess.  Read and 
follow http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php.

No.  Put that stuff in the session, not the cookie.

Ouch.  Security vulnerability.  You can not trust user input.  Unescaped 
user input must not be put directly into databases, HTML, shell execution 
commands or header calls (among other things).  Read 
http://phpsec.org/projects/guide/.


>    if ($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS['form']) {

When you want to access cookies, use $_COOKIE.  That may be the reason 
you're loosing data.  But as mentioned before, you should put this in the 
session.

> entered by the user... but, what happens to the session vars with the

It's not in the session.  It's in a cookie.

Hi all,
 
Well, as it turns out the problem was syntax - 
 
field values had one too many " marks...and the values weren't being
carried into the session.
 
There was
 
<input name="Contact_Name" value=""<? echo $form["Contact_Name"]; ?>"">

instead of

<input name="Contact_Name" value="<? echo $form["Contact_Name"]; ?>">

 
Now field values are being retained on redirect.  [Thank you Hans!!!]
 
 
Onto another question:  in testing the form redirect, i find
textbox-type and textarea-type form field values are retained, but not
checkbox values.
 
How would i include checkbox values in the $form array? 
 
I'd appreciate some tips.
 
Thanks!!

PHP has been officially supported on IBM i since 2006, when Zend/IBM 
began providing IBM i's users with a no-charge package consisting of 
Zend Core, Studio, support, and special extensions.

(IBM i is the newest name for a system formerly called AS/400, iSeries, 
i5, and System i.)

So what's the news about? Till now, Zend Core was only available as a 
download. Now, IBM is making a big statement by including Zend Core on 
IBM i's operating system CDs. Because many IBM i customers take their 
lead from IBM, customers will see this as a strong signal that it's OK 
to use PHP.

These days, I specialize in implementing PHP on IBM i. I've even done 
gigs to mentor teams in implementing Zend Framework on their "i", with 
its special version of db2 and all.

I agree with Brian that there's opportunity for PHP developers 
interested in converting or front-ending text-based "i" applications.

Message-ID: <4994D9A0.1000009@secdat.com>

Andromeda today received significant documentation updates.  Our current 
push is to finish off the docs, then we attack the bugs and proceed to 
Release 1.

1) The entire Database Programming section is finished - Andromeda's 
most important feature.

2) A complete section on Database Access has been added.

3) A complete section on modifying the "free" admin screens has been added.

4) Upgrade scripts have been documented.

5) A new section on using x6 plugins has been started and about 1/2 
completed.

6) Styles have been added for notices and alerts.

In terms of bug fixes and site improvements we have:

1) The search box was fixed.

2) Search now matches lots of relevant terms to pages, so searching for 
"range_from" gets you to the page on ranged primary keys.

3) The image links are now working.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] slow php
Message-ID: <3719ecad0902131231y538628d0l56754c7c27dbd62c@mail.gmail.com>

I have a php 'cron job' script which is inserting some records.  It uses
arrays to store 12 field records along with several nested loops in which it
tests various currency values from a separate 4 field table and sorts them
to get the lowest one for insert into a new 4 field table record.  It has
about 640,000 Product records per 4 Customers or apporx. 2.4 million records
to insert.  It takes several hours+ to complete and I am hoping there is a
way to speed it up.

So far, I've tried updating instead of inserting records and changing a few
functions but nothing seems to make much difference.  Am I being
unreasonable for the size of the files here?  I'm considering using a
Derived Table in mySQL and will also consider another language such as
python.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions.  Thanks.

Do your inserts in chunks. If you have the RAM, do one big insert.
Otherwise you have to hit the disk for each record which can be slow
especially if you have table locks going on elsewhere.

This ain't PHP,and Python won't help.  Inserting 2.4 million rows into a 
database will take hours if you go line by line.  You are paying a big 
overhead of a round trip to the server for each row.

The best way to speed it up is to use what they call "bulk copy" on MS 
SQL Server and "copy" on PostgreSQL.  I'd have to assume mySQL has 
something by the same name.

Also, it may be that mySQL supports multiple inserts per line, in which 
case you can do 10 inserts per round trip.  This will speed it up w/o 
requiring you to do to a different command for the bulk copy.

I would have to agree.  The disk I/O is going to be large for a such a data set.  I think in this instance it is better to ask a few hundred bigger questions of the database then a few million smaller questions.

Why would this be considered a result of PHP being slow?  You're doing many
millions of database queries (both INSERT and SELECT from what you
describe), which is the real culprit.

Some things to consider:

-- minimize lookup queries by caching, or loading your lookup tables into
PHP arrays, thus avoiding database queries

-- make sure that any lookup queries you do perform are against a well
indexed table - similarly, consider key buffer sizes, buffer pool sizes, and
all that good stuff

-- attempt to batch inserts (see http://dev.mysql.com/insert for various
techniques)

-- look at dev.mysql.com and google for mysql bulk insert and mysql bulk
insert configuration - there are a lot of tunables pertaining to these types
of operations, including temp. turning off indexes, etc.

The only PHP specific item I'd consider at this point is to explicitly free
memory and resources to keep the memory footprint as small as possible.
PHP's garbage collection cannot always be, well, perfect, for long running
processes.

If you can get away with it, you might try dumping the data to a csv 
file and using a "load data infile" within mysql to import the whole 
batch of data at once. Another thing that might be slowing down your 
inserts are mysql indexes. If you can disable your indexes, import the 
data, then re-index afterwards, that should speed up the import.

To the best of my knowledge, you can't send more than one statement at
a time through the php interface, unless there's something in the
mysqli extension that allows it.

Perhaps you could generate the SQL insert statements and append them
to a file as you go. When all the loops are done, pipe the file into
MySQL using the command line interface:

mysql -u username -ppassword databasename < file.sql

If some inserts depend on previous inserts (for related row ids or
something) it might take a little more logic to work that all out, but
it should still be possible.

There is http://us2.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.multi-query.php

The fastest way to get data into mysql is like this:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html

I needed to load 2.5M RDF triples into mysql to look up some 
identifiers.  My RDF store balked at the turtle file,  so I hacked away 
the header and treated it like a space-separated file.  LOAD DATA INFILE 
was scary fast...  It loaded the data in 3 seconds!

Once you've loaded raw data into mysql you can do all kinds of tricks like

INSERT INTO ... SELECT

to process the information into the desired form.  If you can do this 
processing w/ clever mysql coding,  you can probably do it in 1/10 the 
LOC and more than 10 times the speed that it would take you in a 
procedural language.  The main thing is that you'll need to be 
comfortable with joins,  subselects and writing extreme queries.

Hi Nicholas:

Here are two additional options to consider, both revolving around the 
concept of getting the database to do the work.

First, many people write scripts to read, modify and then write the data 
back to the database because they are unfamilliar with the INSERT SELECT 
and UPDATE SELECT syntaxes.  These syntaxes are very powerful.

Second, if you have very complex, interdependent operations to do that 
can't be done via queries, turn it into a stored procedure inside MySQL.

Oh, and a third possiblity is to combine the two.  Write some functions 
that you can then use in the queries.

All that aside, you could be having issues with transaction buffers 
getting huge or slow query logging bogging things down.  Are you using 
transactions at all?

The two with which I have experience are WordPress MU
(http://mu.wordpress.org/) and ExpressionEngine
(http://expressionengine.com/).

WordPress MU is, well, WordPress.  If you haven't worked with WordPress
before, customization is a pretty simple.

ExpressionEngine, on the other hand, I threw out as quickly as I possibly
could.

I've used Serendipity
http://www.s9y.org

and Drupal
http://drupal.org

I'd say that Serendipity is pretty good, but that I've moved to Drupal
because of the flexibility to do so much more with it besides
blogging.

Both can run multiple blogs.  I'm not sure about (multiple)
customizations on S9y, but I know drupal can have the UI customized in
a very extensible way

For multiple blogs look at b2evolution.

For something super simple, look at textpattern.

Hello!

Yesterday I applied patches and upgrades to my servers (Apache, MySQL, PHP) 
and while that worked out nicely except that I yet again have to recreate all 
the MySQL user accounts (in my case it is only a few, so I will survive) I 
wondered about the following:
Can I recycle the ini/conf files for Apache and PHP going from version to 
version? I use Apache 2.x and PHP 5.x and the updates I put in were just dot 
releases, but since I spent endless hours tweaking especially the php.ini I 
wonder if it is OK to just keep using it. Any opinions?

Well try to reuse the php.ini files and check the log too see what
breaks,etc. Also, if your ini files are similar to the stock ones in
terms of layout use diff. Better yet find a gui merge tool. I use
winmerge on windows. I'm sure java or x11 ones exist.

In my experience, it's pretty safe at least for minor releases. For  
PHP, you're probably pretty safe until PHP6.  Of course, you should  
thoroughly test and watch any system after an upgrade.

Another config/ini file hint: stick them all in subversion (or your  
VCS of choice).  It's nice to be able to look back and see how  
configurations change over time.

Besides all of these good suggestions, always use "timers" to measure time 
spent behind execution of certain portion of your script to identify what 
part is taking so long.

Or usa an IDE that includes a profiler, because those are designed for that 
purpose (at least during development).

Uh, "have" is the wrong word there. :)  You don't need to drop a database 
before upgrading.  You leave your old tables in place and MySQL provides 
upgrade scripts that implement changes between server versions.

Of course.

To simplify tracking and maintenance, in major systems I've worked on, 
the configuration files only contained a few lines.  Those lines adjusted 
the settings that we didn't like the default values built in to PHP, 
MySQL or Apache.

Additionally, I've seen and made conf and ini files with all the line
spacing and comments stripped out and that also makes for a nice short
and pithy file. (You can keep a copy of a default ini laying around in
case you need a reference.)

But, I just want to clarify here, Dan. So you are saying you can delete
every entry in the Apache conf and MySQL, PHP ini and the products will
work correctly on their own using all default settings that are actually
pre-programmed into the product and get applied with or without the
config files.

And you are saying you need only keep your changed settings in the conf
and ini files?

Do I get that correctly?

So you are saying I could drop in the old system tables as well and run the 
update application? I read several tutorials and they all stated  explicitly 
that one should not do that, but only apply that update mechanism to the own 
tables. Maybe I should read better tutorials?

Uhm, MySQL stores thing like user accounts and privileges in schemas (what 
some also call databases or just tables or data sets). When you do a brand new 
install of MySQL those system tables contain for example the user account 
"root" with no password and privileges for everything. A better approach is to 
obviously first set a root password, and create new user accounts with 
restricted priveleges for use for example by PHP apps.
 From what I read these system tables changed from the old to the new version. 
Also, changes are necessary for any other tables (the ones created by users). 
What I did is a brand new install (I did backup the old, working installation 
first), dropped my custom tables in and ran mysql-update, which updated my 
tables without problems.

So my question is can I do the same procedure for the system tables as well? 
Will mysql-update make it so that the system tables from my old install will 
work with the new version? I ask because....

... some tutorials I read about upgrading explicitly state to not keep the 
system tables, but only drop-in the custom tables and run mysql-update. My 
conclusion from that was that mysql-update will not update system tables or it 
is not recommended to do so. I did  find that to be weird even when I 
installed the new version, because many others most likely deal with more than 
just half a dozen user accounts as it is the case for my install. Since it is 
not much work, but some annoyance to recreate the user accounts and set the 
privileges I didn't bother with digging for more info as I am done doing it 
the manual route by the time I might find something.

Your comments make me believe that this whole "don't upgrade system tables" 
stuff is plain bologna and that there is no difference between custom tables 
and system tables and that they all can be updated using the mysql-update tool.


I hope that this is now less huh. ;)

Looking back at the exchange again I think I misunderstood your reply and 
you may have misunderstood what I was going for.

When I said "leave your old tables in place" I meant you should leave 
them there.  You don't need to move them.  When you install/upgrade 
MySQL, I assume it doesn't overwrite your existing tables.  My assumption 
may be influenced by the fact that I put the data directory in a 
particular location that is not where MySQL puts it by default.

When you said "drop in the old system tables" I missed the "in" so read 
it as "drop the old system tables."  Sorry.


> From what I read these system tables changed from the old to the new 
> version. 

Yes, there have been many changes over the years.  In the directory you 
install MySQL to there's a sub-directory called "scripts."  In there is a 
script called "mysql_fix_privilege_tables."  That script runs various 
ALTER/CREATE TABLE statements that bring you up to date.


> Also, changes are necessary for any other tables (the ones 
> created by users).

The data tables (almost) never need changing.  The only case that's 
needed changing was when ISAM format was dropped in favor of MyISAM.  For 
that, there's the "mysql_convert_table_format" script.

When building a web application that is usually a single page load, what are the criteria that you may use to decide that this feature should be a separate application or this feature be part of another tool?  I always found it interesting how many features are expected to be packed into a form on a web page.

Uh depends. Generally speaking each php script deals with one function. It
might "add, edit or view" the same data via something like smarty templates.

A page may of course have small utility forms like login and search, but I
dont thik you refer to these.

Some functions like profile display and editing might show a lot of
information. You might want to break that down unto multiple screens. How
big is too big in that case? When it seems like too much to type.

Hope that helps,

Justin

I would be remiss if I did not mention Drupal for multiple blogs. It rocks
"out of the box" and is set up for multiple blogs/installs I should also
mention Joomla! for single blogs, it's far more advanced than b2evolution
(actually it has a b2evolution plugin) and it skins faster than a cat.
(Faster than Drupal, some would say) and hosts a bevy of extensions. And in
truth you can set it up for multiple blogs as easily as Drupal, although
they use completely different approaches.

Many thanks for the considerable response!  I have changed the code to
reduce a large number of SELECTs by saving a query to an array.  My problem
now is that although this array is appox. 3,000 records, I need a way to
pass this to a function.  Note: the array contains all discount data while
the function pulls out several sub-queries per user and product codes.
Since there are 5 sub queries, it is probably easier to pass the main one.

Any idea how to pass this array, a pointer to it or make this a global
array?  Making a global array appears to be depricated or discouraged.  I
have tried passing this array which is called $discount but it doesn't
appear to be working when I do.  I also run out of memory which at 128MB is
kind of odd.

Any help is much appreciated..

Best,
Nick

I'm not 100% sure (but someone will correct me if I'm wrong), PHP  
should be pretty smart about this.  If you're just calling a function  
with a big array as a param, PHP will pass in a reference (a  
pointer).  Now, if you actually change data in the array inside your  
function, PHP will then (probably?) clone it.

Too busy today to find out for sure.  You can always force the  
reference by defining your function like: function myFunc(&$my_array)  
{...}

That should ensure that the array is passed by reference.

Think carefully about how that array is structured, and how much you  
loop on it.  It may be that you can speed things up a lot by  
preprocessing the discount data in such a way that you can avoid  
scanning through it all every time.

Leaning on globals is usually somewhat frowned upon, but if this is a  
little self-contained process, there's nothing wrong with storing it  
globally and then referencing the global inside your function.

As for memory limit issues -- you're probably not cleaning up after  
yourself.  Try to unset or otherwise destroy stuff at the end of each  
loop iteration.

One note, please add at least the subject of the thread in when replying to a 
section of a digest email and puleaze trim messages. 90% of your email had 
nothing to do with what you were asking. I won't even get into the top posting 
issue....


Now, by default PHP passes function arguments by value. That means it makes a 
copy of what you specified as argument and works with that copy. That means if 
you pass an array and change an element from within the function the array is 
changed only within the scope of the function. In order to have the original 
be changed as well you can either return the changed array and then assign it 
to the original. The more convenient way is to pass the array by reference, 
because then the function will not make a copy and apply changes to the original.

You find it nicely explained with examples in the PHP manual, especially this 
portion:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php

I must say that the PHO manual is one of the best manuals ever written and the 
web version is even better with all the comments added...although with those 
it happens that some are plain wrong and others are just so old that they no 
longer apply.

Way back when PHP made everything global, which was easier to some extent, but 
really made for sloppy and often incompatible programming. Also, the "&" is 
easily overlooked, so I recommend to mention in the function desciption 
commentary that this array is passed in by reference and what will happen to 
the array passed when using this function.


Crafting very wordy responses is also frowned upon, I take the blame for that one.

My preference is Drupal.  Not only can you run multiple blogs on a site, 
you can run multiple sites within the same software (albeit with 
different databases).  These are three sites running on one Drupal6 
instance:

www.brooklynrowhouse.com
www.homeownerslike.us
www.100senatorstreet.com

Thanks David, this is something I've been meaning to mention.

For those on digest, or just in general, please trim your posts correctly
and if needed, set the subject line correctly.  Where possible, please avoid
HTML email as well.

Just to reiterate some things already mentioned...

If you don't pass by reference (not using the & in the function prototype)
the original value will not be changed.  However, if the function doesn't
change the passed-in variable in any way, PHP shouldn't copy the data it
contains, and thus you won't be using extra memory.

If you do change the variable within the function, PHP institutes
copy-on-write, and thus it'll copy the contents of the variable before
making the modification, and you'll use extra memory.  The original value
will be unchanged.

If you use the ampersand (&) in the function prototype, then you're passing
a reference that refers to the original value.  This means that if the
function modifies the value, the original value that's passed into the
function is also modified.  This doesn't involve a copy of the original
value.

It should be noted that passing by reference (using the ampersand) is
slightly more expensive than passing variables directly - assuming you don't
change the variable in a different scope.  Thus, if you know it won't be
change within the function, you shouldn't use the ampersand in the
function's definition.

This does not apply to objects, which are always passed by reference.  That
is, an object passed into a function, and then modified within the function,
will always modify the original object (you need to clone it otherwise).

Please note that this all applies to PHP 5 only.  PHP 4 is anyone's guess
(and hopefully a long forgotten guess :)  And frankly, this is all
last-understood stuff - any updates to current behavior, or better yet PHP 6
expected behavior, would be welcomed.  Perhaps it's time for another
presentation on this topic?

Wouldn't you just need to do this at the apache level?

 

Something as simple as an "ErrorDocument 200 /path/to/other.notify.script"
in htaccess or in apache conf should allow you to reach this goal

Also check out set_error_handler. There are even some notes on the page 
on handling fatal errors.

The apache method is probably better, if you have the ability to change 
conf files.

Your Javascript code should look like this:

a) did I get the right data back from the server?  If so, report success.
b) Otherwise, report failure to the user.

It doesn't matter what went wrong on the server side, if you're just 
reporting to the user.  MAke your PHP script return something (the word 
"good" for example), have your javascript look for that word, if it didn't 
get that word, report to the user "Something seems to be wrong".

Behind the scenes it might matter to you what went wrong with the PHP 
script, but it doesn't matter to the user at all.  You shouldn't be testing 
the http status code as a way to figure out if things were successful - test 
some data output by the PHP script, where that data is only sent if 
everything went correctly.

Your reply is perfectly logical but I am trying not to redesign alot of code. The PHP code is currently designed to return  a string or nothing depending on the action taken. If a fatal error occurs, nothing is returned which unfortunately is also a valid response. 
P.S. set_error_handler will not handle fatal errors (E_ERROR). 
   
 "The following error types cannot be handled with a user defined function: E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_CORE_WARNING, E_COMPILE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_WARNING, and most of E_STRICT raised in the file where set_error_handler() is called." 
Thank everyone for the help,
Lori

Working now in QA and having had years of experience with support you do want 
to report exactly what went wrong and what the user can do about it (if 
possible).  Implementing useless error messages is just bad advice and makes 
for bad software. Make your PHP script determine what went wrong and show a 
useful error message. At a minimum an error message must include:
- type of error
- reason for error
- what was received (if applicable)
- what was expected (if applicable)
- measures to prevent or workaround error or instructions to obtain additional 
help (such as "Read the applicable error description in the help here: <link 
to help topic>" or "Contact support at blahblah at blah.blah"). Ideally, provide 
a solution right then and there.

Optionally report this:
- the name of the module / script in which the error occured
- additional information such as server and PHP version or custom error codes

Error messages must fulfill three tasks:
- appear when otherwise the application would not continue to work correctly 
or data loss can occur (for example, showing an error message is better than 
just blue screen)
- provide information about what went wrong, why it went wrong, and what one 
can do about it
- provide information that really helps the developer to fix the bug (if there 
is one)

Messages like "Something seems to be wrong" are as useful as any other random 
array of words. The user already noticed that something went wrong as the 
outcome is not the one expected.

I know that proper error handling and reporting is a thankless, tedious task 
that adds zero functionality to an application. It is boring work and every 
developer hates it. It is also never complete. But it for sure helps everyone 
who makes or uses the application. Not implementing proper error handling and 
reporting is not an option.

If we never received an email, should we assume we did not register in  
time? Seems like they could be bothered to email everyone one way or  
the other, since it's so unclear...

You should read my prior message again, as you haven't understood it.

The user can't work around a PHP fatal error in an Ajax call.  Knowing the 
module that broke is nothing but confusing for the user.  No major website 
implements the procedures you describe.

Here's Gmail's errors:

http://mail.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=error_msg.cs

Note that all of the serious errors - something actually broken - are things 
like "Oops" and "Temporary Error 502" and "We're experiencing technical 
difficulties that may prevent your chats from being sent".  There's 
absolutely nothing in there about a crash in module someRandomGmailModule on 
line 972.

If the error is truly due to something under the user's control ("cookies 
not enabled"), there's a good case for telling the user that.  But there's 
nothing the user can do with a PHP script that throws a fatal error.

The words "Something seems to be wrong" are my shorthand for a short error 
message to the user indicating a problem.  In general, it is totally useless 
and massively counterproductive and often presents security problems to give 
the user internal details of the error.  Probably the number 1 source of XSS 
vulnerabilities is echoing user-submitted data back in error pages.

Certainly the PHP script which blew a gasket ought to log something to the 
system log files, trying its best to tell the maintainers what went wrong 
and how.  But exposing those messages to the users is terrible practice.  
Nor is it even possible, since the Javascript call *by definition* won't get 
much useful from a PHP page where a fatal error occurred - whatever useful 
information there is must be logged by the PHP script itself.

Exactly.  You've identified the problem precisely: your Javascript currently 
can't distinguish between success and failure.  I described how to do that: 
on success, send something specific (I used the word "good"), and have the 
Javascript look for it.  You don't have to echo it to the screen or 
anything, just look for it and be happy if it comes.  In ANY case when you 
don't get that specific response, some error has occurred and the Javascript 
should therefore be unhappy and tell the user that something is not right.

There's no other way to do it.  You can't have nothing be a valid response 
because as you've seen, it's possible to get nothing as an error response 
too.

I registered back in Jan and got a confirmation for that. Then another 
saying I had a seat reserved. Then another asking me to rsvp. Did you get 
those? The RSVP has to go to code at nytimes.com

I registered on 1/30 and my email said:

'Thank you for your interest in attending Times Open. We're pleased to 
inform you that a seat at the conference has been reserved in         
your name.

Because attendance is limited and there is a waiting list, please RSVP to 
code at nytimes.com before Feb. 6 to confirm your space.'


Ironically, I forgot to rsvp but they sent me a reminder last week which I 
completed.

Thanks. I'll send them an email and see what happens.

I definitely registered before January 30.

The PDF is interesting, although they fail to include the technologies in

In some cases, there's an apparent mix right off the bat.  There may be
other mixes of technology, but I didn't go much deeper than the homepage of
each site.

Those marked with ??? were hard to pin down exactly what they were using.
Any thoughts/feedback would be welcomed.

Seems the NY Times and/or their partner Cvent botched the User Experience 
design here.  The process has way too many steps and at least the initial 
email was confusing.

I initially registered, on January 19.  They sent an email saying the 
following:

   Please note, this is not a ticket to the event. We will let you know
   by January 30 that you are confirmed for the Times Open session.
   Thank you.
   ... snip ...
   To view your online registration reservation, click the link below. 
   You will be asked to enter the confirmation number shown above.
   ... snip link ...

I read that to mean I was on the list and would receive a confirmation.  
I didn't look at that link page and enter the registration code.  The 
other day, as others have mentioned, I got the email saying "because of 
space limitations, we cannot extend a registration confirmation."

Looking back on all this, considering what others have said, it seems 
that they expected us to follow up on that web page in order to receive a 
confirmation.

Lame.  Oh well,

--Dan

One look at the LiveJournal source code and I discovered all the *.php files they link to.  This would mean they do at least use PHP.  What platforms they use it on is still debatable.

Sorry about the name, I use a seperate email account for the NYPHP list and 
apparently typed the account name into the name field.

As for it not being appropriate for NYPHP, why not? There is a PHP-related 
topic in the call-for-papers and the conference is in NY.

We need to keep random announcements to an absolute minimum on this list, as
traffic is high as it is.  This also is not an "IT MANAGEMENT" group and the
vast majority of the topics aren't relevant to the group.  Furthermore, the
message looked a lot like spam.

In the future, please check with us first before doing these types of posts.

Hi all

Recently I've started creating some project using PHP on the back-end 
and Flex on the front-end and so far I was using XML files for data transfer

Recently I started testing with zend framework and zend_amf
do you think that for project that is using just flex on the user side I 
should use zend framework and their MVC structure? or it is just to much 
of a hassle with little benefit?

 From what I read I can use just zend_amf without the framework - does 
anyone has any experience with it?

Thanks,
Artur

Hi,

At my company we use Zend (no AMF though) with flex front ends. We talk 
to Flex via XML. It works great.
What Zend lacked was a truly RESTful router, so we extended Zend and 
created one.

Zend is nice because it doesn't force you to solve problems in a 
particular way - it gives you the tools.
But if your not utilizing Zend (db, caching, etc) maybe you don't need it.

Hey Artur,

I have some experience creating Flex/AIR applications that communicate with PHP using Zend_Amf. My preference is to use the zend amf without the MVC structure. Especially if the front end is entirely Flex.

If you have any questions about the setup feel free to drop me a line.

Wade Arnold's blog is a really great resource:
http://wadearnold.com/blog/

As well, there are a couple articles in the newest issue of php|architect about Flex/AIR and PHP (disclaimer: I wrote one of them). 

Thanks!
Ricky

I have experience with amfphp, and it works as promised  (no
experience with Zend_AMF).  However, if I could do it over again, I
would probably just use json / json-rpc.  AMF is a really tight
serialization format, but it makes debugging a pain in the neck
because it is not human readable.  AMF has some performance advantages
if you are sending loads of binary data, and it has features for
dynamic record sets.

I avoid XML where possible for communicating with the client.  With
XML you have to write custom code to serialize and deserialize, or
bundle a massive soap library on the client side.

An application I work on uses JSON to communicate.  I've adjusted our 
.htaccess file to print out a JSON string.  Note: pick only ONE, 
depending on which version of Apache is in play.  Note: remove line wrap.

In Apache 1.3:

   ErrorDocument 500 "var response = {"code":500,"message":"Apache
   server error"};

In Apache >= 2.0:

   ErrorDocument 500 "var response = {\"code\":500,\"message\":\"Apache
   server error\"};"

Thanks a lot

I need to transfer a lot of binary data and in addition I need it to be 
as much dynamic as possible so I will try to use zend_amf then but 
without MVC structure - I think it is too much for small one-man project

I've had success using the amfphp system.  Have not tried Zend's.  Either
way, you can definitely use just amf communication - without using the rest
of a huge mvc package.

Check out http://amfphp.org/

These websites were very helpful to me in figuring out the configuration:
http://www.howtoforge.com/amfphp_adobe_flex2_sdk
http://viconflex.blogspot.com/2007/04/mapping-vos-from-flex-to-php-using.html

The main reason I'm sticking with amfphp is because of their amf service
browser - which makes debugging VERY easy.

Unlike one of the other posters, I've had no trouble debugging amf objects
at all.  I never had reason to try and look at the binary content... I put
break-points in the flex builder to see what objects look like in the
debugger when they come over from PHP - and I put error_log()-type
statements in the php code to see what data looks like coming over from
Flex.

All in all, I've found amf to be very easy to work with.
Good luck!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP and Flex
Message-ID: <b94c23160902192120q421860afr4762daabcca09c62@mail.gmail.com>

Two other bits of information on this topic...

1) I forgot to mention that there are two really helpful videos on Lee
Brimelow's website that helped me learn the basics of amfphp early on:
http://gotoandlearn.com/play?id=78
http://gotoandlearn.com/play?id=79
(he also has this video I have not watched about ZendAMF:
http://gotoandlearn.com/play?id=90)

2) My team just today successfully migrated the server-side portion of our
flex & php application  from a home-grown framework to cakephp.  With
minimal tinkering, we were able to make amfphp work with cake (that after
discovering that it was kind of a pain in the butt to make cake's native amf
system work).  So yah, one more happy story about amfphp.

I want to get my *. htm and *.html files to be parsed as PHP files.
With shared hosting I don't have access to Apache conf, but I can put
.htaccess files 
in my dirs. So I am planning to add this line:

AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .html .htm

? in the .htaccess file.

Anyone have any comment on this strategy pro or con?
Has anyone done this and was satisfied with the results?

Hi Peter,

This is exactly what I did on my server about 10 years ago when I 
started my journey with PHP. I don't remember why but I wanted to keep 
all my extensions as .html so I used it for few years

There is only one con - all your files will be parsed by PHP. So if you 
want to use some caching, static content etc it will still use PHP 
engine for display - I would say not recommended for very high traffic.
For small website It should be ok

Artur

Peter:

I don't know how to judge if it's a good idea, or 
not -- but I do it. My .htaccess file is a bit 
different from yours, namely:

# handler for phpsuexec. -- this makes these prefixes considered for php
<FilesMatch "\.(htm|html|css|tpl)$">
  SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

Note that I also have css in there so I can embed 
php code in css -- that's neat.

The only problem I have run into that some 
browsers, like FireFox require this --

<?php header('Content-Type: text/css; charset=UTF-8'); ?>

-- to be the first line in my non-php files. But 
that hasn't been a big problem for me.

HTH's

Not good for performance or scalability. A PHP framework with routing 
should allow you use URLs with .html at the end without resorting to 
changing Apache's behavior.

Now that I think about it, Apache's behavior at default is to 
consider embedded php -- so I'm not sure why one would want to add a 
directive to parse html files as php.

Furthermore, if you don't wrap your html code in a heredoc wrapper, 
the html code will cause the script to crash.

So maybe we need to investigate this a bit further -- why do you want 
to do this Peter?

Cheers,

tedd

Okay, well thank you to all for the insightful responses so far.

So this probably is an SEO issue. In that I am looking at a niche all
HTML site 
that has been up for awhile and has gained decent google relevancy in
search results.

I am concerned that changing all the page names from
"topic_specific_file_name.html" to 
"topic_specific_file_name.php" might make all the pages appear as all
new pages to 
google and re-set the search results standing for the entire site. 

So I was considering the *.html parsed thru PHP technique to get PHP
into all the pages.

And in a dark personal corner I did like a little the modicum of
security through obscurity that 
this technique might gain.

So now if anyone with some SEO/search background can weigh in on the
page name change issue 
that would be great.

Warmest regards,

Peter:

I don't know how Google or other search engines may view changes like 
that, but I can't imagine the change would be significant -- both 
suffixes work. It's my understanding that SE's look at content rather 
than the suffix, but I could be wrong.

It you belong to scrubtheweb.com, you might ask them -- they would know.

Cheers,

I'm not an SEO pro, but if there aren't a ton of pages, I'd suggest  
creating new page with the .php suffix, and then redirect the old urls  
to the new ones with 301 status from apache.

This is the proper, official way to move a resource.  And google  
approves of it:

Why exactly?  mod_php is both performant and scalable.

You're saying that  complex framework is a better solution than a
configuration one-liner.  Why?


I've used this technique successfully before when converting a series
of websites with tens of thousands of flat html files into my own
custom CMS under the covers.

Apache's default for .html is text/html

That's not correct.  If .html files are parsed through Mod_php, the
default behavior of the PHP module is to output the contents just like
text/html, which is why you have to add PHP processing instructions
(aka "tags") to your PHP files to turn ON php i.e. <?php print
("foo"); ?>    I'm saying that turning on PHP processing of regular
HTML files will output HTML just like if you didn't pass the file
through mod_php.

Why exactly?  mod_php is both performant and scalable.

You're saying that  complex framework is a better solution than a
configuration one-liner.  Why?


I've used this technique successfully before when converting a series
of websites with tens of thousands of flat html files into my own
custom CMS under the covers.

mod_php can be a memory hog, bloating your httpd processes.  Who needs  
that bloat to serve static content?

Nice little webcast about this here:

Here I agree.  Frameworks are great for complex systems.

But they're more trouble than they're worth if all you want is pretty  
URLs.  Though, I suppose you could write a little microframework to  
just do routing.  But, on the other hand, you've already got  
mod_rewrite.

Greg:

You are absolutely right.

I was thinking of using html without "<?php echo($whatever); ?>" and 
using php variables directly in the html code.

You are on the right track.  You could do a bazillion 301 redirects
from .html to .php , but that is a waste of your time, will slow down
page loads, and 301 redirects don't always pass 100% of the link
juice.  Why bother?

Thanks for the link Tim.  That webcast offers a good explanation of
the differences between a couple options for running PHP (Apache
Module v. FastCGI implementation).  However, the OP was looking to add
PHP capabilities (e.g. logic, dynamic content, navigation, sessions,
whatever) to a collection of static html files.  That means he must
use PHP -- either mod_php or fastcgi and will take on some performance
overhead.  And the question is whether he should just turn on the PHP
interpreter for requests to *.html or some other approach.  Saying
fastcgi is faster than mod_php doesn't offer a solution to the
original question.  To add the php interpreter to a collection .html
URIs, you can turn it on at the server configuration level (with the
AddHandler directive "plan
A"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler ) or
you could do it in a few other ways.

I think the most commonly seen method is to abandon the original URIs.
E.g. "Due to a "site upgrade" our homepage home.html has now moved to
home.php, please update your bookmarks". But I must say that is a bad
idea.

One alternate way (that has been suggested and even seconded) is to
use an application framework (assuming that it has some dispatcher
mechanism that maps the request to the original content) so that it
can respond appropriately to requests for your original URIs.  This
could be implemented with many PHP frameworks (or Python etc.)  The
business case for "creating an application" depends on many factors we
don't know about -- so I'd hesitate to recommend it apriori.  In fact,
I'd say that is a answer to a problem that hasn't been asked yet.

Besides telling Apache to handle *.html requests with the php
interpreter via the AddHandler directive (either as an Apache module,
or fastcgi implementation, or perhaps using lighthttpd...) another
option is to use content negotiation (which is more often used for
translations but works just as well for mime types).   Rename all the
.html files as .php and let Apache serve the mapped file.
http://www.w3.org/QA/2006/02/content_negotiation.html and
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_negotiation.html  This
approach will not change the requested URIs, so it is SEO-neutral.
I'd recommend using this approach while simultaneously updating all
internal references to be technology-agnostic.  Client requests
foo.html --> Apache finds foo.php and serves it as foo.html.  bar.php
should link to "foo" rather than foo.html or foo.php  The resource on
disk should be foo.php so that developers can know the technology in
use, and IDEs can easily identify the mime-type.

You could rename all the files (*.html -> *.php) and use mod_rewrite
under the covers but that would be a double performance hit: once for
mod_rewrite execution; the other intentional performance hit for
invoking PHP.

I'm assuming that static or anonymous content serving (e.g.
about.us.html which is now about.us.php on disk and served through the
php interpreter in response to requests to either about.us or
about.us.html) would be optimized using php caching, or other caching
strategies.  Info at
http://freephile.com/wiki/index.php/PHP_Accelerator

It's been a while since I dug into the current link juice algorithms,
but I'd say that as long as external links to your content still work
with a 200 response, then you're good.  If you're implementing visible
(to the client) redirects or changing URIs then you're in for a hit.

Also, for those interested in benchmarking performance of different
servers (Apache v. Lighty), deployment options for PHP (cgi v. module)
or PHP versions (php4 v. php5) here are a couple of good links:

Hi All

In my company we are using Linux servers where we have PHP, mysql and 
all other nice stuff. My new manager is a Java guy and he always worked 
with Java and his new idea is to move all our stuff to Jboss. There is 
only one problem - we don't have enough time to migrate all of our PHP 
code to some Java stuff and he wants to install PHP servlet inside jboss 
to serve PHP content. Idea is ok but all info I could find in google is 
how to do it in Windows :( and all php5servlets that I found are for 
windows (php5servlet.dll). Has anyone ever done something similar and 
have an idea at least where to start?

Thanks
Artur

It's in $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'].  My favorite way to figure stuff like 
this out is putting phpinfo() in the page you're curious about.

Sorry for not really answering your question, but _exactly_ why do they 
want to do this?  Seems like they don't know what they're doing.  Adding 
needless layers is a really bad idea.

There are a few ways to approach PHP/JEE application server integration, 
and the solution you pick depends on the answer to a few questions:

- Is this a straight conversion of your applications from PHP to Java? Or 
do you intend to leave some portion in PHP?
- Do you need your PHP and Java application modules to communicate with 
each other?
- What sort of transition plan are you looking at?  Phased, or complete in 
one shot?   Only new features in Java?
- What benefit - besides being more comfortable with Java as a language - 
is your manager looking to get from Java as a platform?  PHP is better at 
some things, Java, others.
- Why JBoss and not just Tomcat or Geronimo?  Or any other JEE application 
server for that matter?

In my opinion, the best place to start is to use Apache as a front end to 
both your PHP and JEE applications, and let Apache decide which to 
delegate the request to based on the URL pattern. 

In this scenario, JBoss and PHP would know nothing about each other, but 
could share data via MySQL or client-side cookies.   This is good for 
supporting a phased approach and keeps your inter-Java/PHP dependencies to 
a minimum.

This article is close to 4 years old, but it covers this scenario in a 
WebSphere specific way (though the concepts are generic):
   Pair J2EE with PHP to implement a common Web application infrastructure
   
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0505_krook/0505_krook.html

You could also explore PHP / Java integration via a bridge using several 
approaches:

Or, use a PHP interpreter written in Java (my least favorite option... but 
gaining in popularity), integrating Java and PHP in the same JVM, which is 
what Quercus, Project Zero and others do:

they want to migrate to java only but during the transition process we 
need part of our old PHP code to run alongside with java

temporary we will leave our PHP code but the long term goal is to 
translate everything to Java

this is not that important but it might be required in some cases (worst 
case scenario we can solve it using XML or other method)

phased - new features in Java and gradually transferring old code to 
Java as well

this is out of the question at all - we tried we failed - we have to go 
with Java

same as above

this is what I was thinking but pressure is to have jboss (with tomcat) 
on the first line and then if request is meant for php then send it to 
apache (which can be run internally with no problems)

Append each sub-key's name to the current name, separated by an underscore.

$deep['foo']['bar']['quux']

becomes

$flat['foo_bar_quux']

Provided the keys don't have underscores in them already, of course. ;-)

This happens all the time when people want to get data into Excel or
CSV for statistical analysis.

Its a tree structure so Ive no idea how many arrays are in there, so Id 
need to walk through each array recursively and get keys?

Yup, your standard depth-first tree traversal.

But in order to build a flat array, I'd have to pass that by reference 
into my recursive function so it can append the each node right?

Hey guys,

I have a lot of PHP code written that uses the mysql extension.
Should I rework the code to use mysqli extension?
How can I tell if it will be worth the effort and time?

Any advice would appreciated. Thanks!

Hey guys,

Some more questions.

1. Is there a significant speed difference between the equal operator
(==) and the identical operator (===)?  Should I even be concerned
about this?  For example, if I know a variable will be of type INT
100% of the time, and I pass it to a function which expects the
variable to an INT, should I use even use === inside the function when
doing comparisons?  Or is using === in this case just a waste of time?

2. What's the best way to cast?  For example, is it best to use (int)
$variable or intval($variable)?

Thanks again,
Konstantin

 From my experience if mysql is sufficient you shouldn't rewrite all the 
code

I used mysqli recently because I had to establish SSL connection to the 
external database server (mysql extension cannot do that)
I worked great and I discovered power of OO mysqli
I really liked it and if possible I will use it from now on but I don't 
think you will gain anything by rewriting old code
mysqli is faster (some people claim 30% gain) but is it worth time and 
effort? you have to judge based on your current projects, load on the 
server etc - but maybe it will be cheaper and easier to buy some extra RAM

Questions like this amuse me.

Not surprisingly, === is faster. If the two compared values are both 
INT, it's faster but not by much.
If the two compared values are not the same type and one is a string, 
then equals (==) takes twice as long.
Unless you are running a huge number of comparisons, it shouldn't make 
much of a difference.

Here is a blog entry about micro-optimization:
http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001218.html

And here is a script to test it for yourself:

<?php

// Rolan Yang - rolan at omnistep.com

$a = "42"; // change these to different types for fun
$b = 42; // change these to different types for fun
$i = 5000000; // iterations

print "== vs === speed test\n\n";
print "a=".gettype($a)."\n";
print "b=".gettype($b)."\n\n";
$s=getmicrotime();
print "Equal (==) \nstart:$s\n";
for ($x=0;$x<$i;$x++) {
    if ($a==$b) {}
}
$e=getmicrotime();
print "end:$e\nTotal:".($e-$s)."\n\n";

$s=getmicrotime();
print "Identical (===) \nstart:$s\n";
for ($x=0;$x<$i;$x++) {
    if ($a===$b) {}
}
$e=getmicrotime();
print "end:$e\nTotal:".($e-$s)."\n";

function getmicrotime() {
    list($x,$y)=explode(' ',microtime());
    return ($x+$y);

You could use array_merge() on the way out. Do you want to preserve
keys, or can you handle getting back a numerically indexed array?

Numerical index is fine.

I initially had a similar reaction when I saw this comment, but when I really thought about it, that's the power of PHP (that it's 
  so easy to just try stuff).  Asking a similar question about "how" on a haskell list would probably not elicit such a response, 
but the more I think about it, the more I think that the above answer might be the right one, considering the context :-]

	good luck in any case,

In php 5.3 we should be able to:

function flatten($arr) {
  $result = array();
  array_walk_recursive($arr,function($k,$v) use (&$result) {$result[] = $v});
  return $result;
}

Shows the power of closures & lambdas.

Of course that code is of no use to you.

Try:

function flatten($arr) {
  $result = array_values($arr);
  $i = 0;
  while($i < count($result) )
    is_array($result[$i]) ?
      array_splice($result,$i,1,array_values($result[$i])) :
      $i++;
  return $result;
}

It took me a minute to figure out what you're doing there, very neat
approach to handling the sub-arrays!

If you want to retain the keys, you could do something like:

function flatten($input,$separator = '_')
{
  if (!is_array($input)) {
    return false;
  }

  _flatten($input,$output = array(),$separator);

  return $output;
}

function _flatten(&$input,&$output,$sep,$prefix = '')
{
  foreach ($input as $k => $v) {
    $new_k = $prefix ? $prefix . $sep . $k : $k;
    if (is_array($v)) {
      _flatten($v,$output,$sep,$new_k);
    } else {
      $output[$new_k] = $v;
    }
  }
}

Well, no, he's right. I was just being mean because I underestimated
how mind-bending the problem is.

You have to pass your new array by reference, but you also have to
pass the current key you're working on so that it can be prepended to
new keys as you traverse them.

My code is similar to Dan's:

<?php

function flatten( $array, &$flatarray, $currentkey ) {
  foreach( $array AS $key=>$val ) {
    $nextkey = $currentkey.'_'.$key;
    if ( is_array( $val ) ) {
      flatten( $val, $flatarray, $nextkey );
    }
    else {
      $flatarray[ $nextkey ] = $val;
    }
  }
}

$array = array( 'a'=>array('b'=>'bee', 'c'=>'cee' ), 'b'=>array(
'd'=>'dee', 'e'=>'eee', 'f'=>array('g'=>'gee', 'h'=>'hee' ) ) );
$flat = array();

foreach ( $array AS $key=>$val ) {
  if ( is_array( $val )) {
    flatten( $val, $flat, $key );
  }
  else {
    $flat[ $key ] = $val;
  }
}

That took all of ten minutes to write and test, but there was
definitely an "oh shi... " moment figuring out how to get the keys
right.

True, but consider the fact that posting to this list was only made after 
already messing with some code, Googling, reading stuff, etc.

Yep, I was using array_merge and that's wrong. Im dealing with a list of 
objects so that made it a little confusing but I got it working. In this 
case I was dealing with a tree of categories where each category has a 
parent_node and the top-level categories have a parent_node of zero. So it 
was something like:

function getsubcategories($parent_id, &$list)
{
	$categories = getcategorieswithparent($parent_id);
	if ($categories != NULL)
	{
		foreach ($categories as $category)
		{
			// append object
			$list[] = $category;
			getsubcategories($category->parent_id(), $list);
		}
	}
}

getsubcategories(0, $current_list);


Im using this to populate a pulldown in a form with a nice function to 
show the pathname to each category.
