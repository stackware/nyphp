Hmm. Did you make the links manually in the post, or did they get 
generated automatically when you uploaded a photo to WP.
I'm talking about manually adding a link with an absolute url in the 
body of the post.

I don't know if it works when you upload a photo in WP, even if it's an 
absolute url in the code that WP generates.

Also, I say "LINKS" here meaning the anchor tag, not the img src=

A quick look at your site and I don't see links on the images on the 
first few pages.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP HTML Document Parser
Message-ID: <000001c6e56f$9dea5af0$6701a8c0@SUNCODE1>

I'm looking for a free PHP module/class/script that can accept an 
HTML document as a string or file and might have a few methods built in 
to help parse the file for certain keywords or the grab the textual content 
between certain open and closing HTML tags.
 
This module/class/script does not have to make the connection to get the 
file, only to do the parsing.
 
As usual thanks in advance if you know something that fits the bill.

I've used this:

with some success ... but not for production code -- just for some
script-checks, conversions.

Hello All,

I've just installed GTK from source, following these directions:
http://gtk.php.net/manual/en/tutorials.installation.linux.php
$ ./buildconf
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
Everything built find. I then added php_gtk2.so module to the extension's in 
php.ini, restarted apache.

I ran
$ php -m | grep php-gtk
and got ...Unable to load dynamic library, 
'/usr/lib/php/modules/php_gtk2.so'....undefine symbol: phpi_get_le_gd in 
Unknown on line 0...

Well, looks pretty obvious an error in the .c code. I've done apache module 
development in the past, and the 'Unknown' could point to c code.

Anyways, I've done some goggle searching..nothing to helpful. So does anyone 
have any tips or work arounds?

Thanks, Ben

(guess) Try something like "php -m | grep gd" to see if you are  
loading gd.so as well?

Its making a reference to a function in GD that it can't find (either  
lib path is wrong or something else), or may need to compile PHP  
again with --with-gd=/path/to/gd

And probably make sure its getting loading via extension_dir first  
before php_gtk2.

Hey all,

Thanks Jon. I am adding GTK to an existing PHP installation. It appears php 
was compiled with '--with-gd=shared'.
The only module that fails to load is the gtk one.

Also, the extension_dir is being correctly set.

Any other ideas?

Thanks, Ben

So both extentions were compiled w/ =shared and both are loading in  
via php.ini to extension_dir and in the ~same~ directory?

(guess) Im not sure if this matters anymore but where does your (env)  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH point to?  Probably would not hurt to tack on your  
extension_dir @ the beginning.

Sorry not much help, but have toyed w/ PHP-GTK in the past ...

Make sure that both extensions were compiled against the same version of 
PHP and that you are loading PHP-GTK in the same executable that you 
compiled it against (Should be compiled against a CLI version not a CGI 
version).

If everything looks good you can try looking at this thread: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-gtk-general&m=114317952909700&w=2 
(although it doesn't say much more) Also, try the PHP-GTK-general 
mailing list.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT - Recommendatons for MySQL books?
Message-ID: <45211690.1040007@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

I'd like to invest in a book that focuses entirely on MySQL.  I have one 
book that looks at PHP/MySQL but I feel that there is a lot that I am 
missing.

My experience level/goals:
I'd like to learn about database design and the features of MySQL.  I've 
been programming with PHP for about four years and working with MySQL 
for the same amount of time.  While my PHP skills have been growing I 
feel that my database skills have remained pretty flat.

For example, relational database design, primary keys, indexing, etc. 
are all terms that I have varying degrees of familiarity with but I 
would like to learn much more about them.  There are some times that I 
am solving a problem with PHP and wondering if it would be more 
efficient if I used a feature in MySQL instead.

I'd be interested in a book that has a chapter on database security as well.

Would appreciate any recommendations.  Thanks!

-Aaron

MySQL Cookbook by Paul DuBois.

That's a great book -- lot's of ways to use MySQL and thus learn 
features, concepts, and design.

If you want more in depth stuff, try:

High Performance MySQL by Zawodny et al.

Serious stuff.

High Performance MySQL is one of my favorite books.  I just got Pro MySQL because I wanted to learn a bit more about the newer MySQL features like stored procedures and views.  It seems very thorough... though I haven't gotten very deep into it yet.  It does have a chapter on security.

MySQL Database Design and Tuning by mySql press is a great book - 
http://dev.mysql.com/books/mysqlpress/

It covers in-depth information about the various storage engines in 
mysql: innoDB, myISAM, Memory, Heap, Archive and how they work (row 
locking) and when/why to use them for various data-types.  These various 
storage engines are what make MySQL such a powerful database engine.  
Also, the book also covers indexing methods - primary and foreign keys, 
hashing, column types.  Basically it covers everything relating to 
database design for mysql and focuses less on tricks you can do with SQL 
queries.  I highly recommend it.

I don't think you can order it through amazon - where I normally get all 
my books.  But if you go to a Barnes and Noble I'm sure they have it.  
Give it a look I'm sure it is what you are looking for.

Besides the books (which tend to get outdated pretty quickly as items
change in core code) ... I find the free webinars that they give every
month to be pretty much in depth and up to date w/ the latest info.  The
archive is good as well ..
http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/on-demand-webinars/

Also the study guide for MySQL 5.0 certification is also a great
in-depth surprise for being a "study guide".

And subscribing to a few feeds @ http://www.planetmysql.org/ helps.

High Performance MySQL is one of my favorite books.  I just got Pro
MySQL because I wanted to learn a bit more about the newer MySQL
features like stored procedures and views.  It seems very thorough...
though I haven't gotten very deep into it yet.  It does have a chapter
on security.

Hey all,

Yes I have php (cli). I believe gd was never installed.
There was no trace of the gd.so. I did a yum update php-gd
and then added the module to php.ini.

Besides the fact that apache doesn't server pages when the php-gtk/gd 
modules are loaded (yet they work) it works.

I had to comment out the modules to get apache to work as usual.

Strange...

Thanks!

- Ben

Make sure that both extensions were compiled against the same version of
PHP and that you are loading PHP-GTK in the same executable that you
compiled it against (Should be compiled against a CLI version not a CGI
version).

If everything looks good you can try looking at this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-gtk-general&m=114317952909700&w=2
(although it doesn't say much more) Also, try the PHP-GTK-general
mailing list.

PHP-GTK should not be loaded in your php.ini for Apache. I have two 
separate php.ini files and compiled my cli php to look in a different 
location for its php.ini file. The apache version uses the default 
location.

There is a Tidy library by John Coggeshall that does a ton but I have 
found it to be a very dry sandwich to consume without a decent pint of 
beer. Maybe that's cause I am such a lousy PHP coder, but the team I was 
working with loved it and got everything they needed from it.  Maybe 
start with a Zend article here http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/761

Go ahead chuckle it up. But, yes, I need this one little one. 
I begin with a numerically indexed array of elements (could be any length):
 
$master_names  = array("Joe", "Sam", "Tom" ... )
 
I need to rename all the array elements as to make a matching consistent
associative array.
And... the keys in the associative array must be derived from combining the
name of the array 
(in this example 'master_names') with the correct former index value
appended on the end of 
each new key:
 
$master_names = array('master_names0'=>"Joe", 'master_names1'=>"Sam,
'master_names2'=>"Tom" ... ) 
 
 
OR
 
$master_names[0]="Joe"
$master_names[1]="Sam"
$master_names[2]="Tom"
 
becomes...
 
$master_names['master_names0']="Joe"
$master_names['master_names1']="Sam"
$master_names['master_names2']="Tom"
 
 
Yes, that is it.

This is technically correct, thank you. Except your solution takes it for
granted that 
we always want the new associative array keys to be named
'master_names'.$index, but 
that is not the case.
 
The new keys must take on the name of the original array variable name
whatever it was, 
more like so:
 
$Any_Variable_Name = array('joe', 'adam', 'alex');
$master_new   = array( );
 
while(list($index, $value) = each($Any_Variable_Name))
{
    $master_new[$Any_Variable_Name. $index] = $value;
}

 
Thank you.
Peter

Hi,

I usually create a second numerically indexed array that has as elements 
the key names. The numerical keys correspond to each other so that I only 
need a while loop and a counter to access each element of the source arrays 
that I then stick together as key/element pairs in a resulting array. I do 
not know the exact circumstance, but I needed to get two things out of a 
database that were related to each other and that had to be of the same 
count by design. Worked great, but today I'd use SQL and a join for this, 
which works even better.

David

You would have to have the name of the array variable stored in another 
variable. Then you have to access the array with a variable variable.

${$array_name}[$array_name . $index] = $value;

Unfortunately, there is no way to get the name of a variable dynamically 
like that. You would have to have it hard coded somewhere.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Smarty Template question
Message-ID: <000501c6e68d$fe0426e0$12a8a8c0@HirschLaptop>

I have a table comprised of a PHP file and Smarty template. It's so
lovely that I have decided to display it several times on one page, with
different conditions for each iteration. Example: a table for pending
projects, a table for completed project.terminated projects, etc. 
 
If the PHP and templates were built successively, I think this would
work. But since, with Smarty, the PHP runs first and than the individual
template "pieces" are populated with the assigned variables, the last
"table build" would simply be displayed in all the tables. Follow me?
 
Making each PHP version of the table an object would be simple. But how
can I use one template for multiple instances on one page? The only
solution I can think of it to build an array and have loop over the
array for each version of the table. Any other ideas?

The smarty template does not have to be a complete page. I believe you 
can call a template multiple times from within the PHP document e.g.

$smarty->display('header.tpl');

$data=getTableData($first);
$smarty->assign('data',$data);
$smarty->display('tabletemplate.tpl');

$data=getTableData($second);
$smarty->assign('data',$data);
$smarty->display('tabletemplate.tpl');

$data=getTableData($third);
$smarty->assign('data',$data);
$smarty->display('tabletemplate.tpl');

$smarty->display('footer.tpl');

Rolan:

Many thanks. Seems obviously, but I have been stuck because I use a
single Display command with the "content template" included in the
middle of a master template.

It seems like Multiple Displays would work, but it does make it more
difficult to keep track of lots of pieces in a complex template. Perhaps
I could use Fetch instead to take care of this one problem and then
still use Display to build the composite template.

I'm confused by mod_rewrite
 
What is the point? What is the big deal?
 
Why is www.website.com/page/action/stuff/morestuff/
 
Better than
 
www.website.com/page.php?action=something&id=#&....
 
 
What difference does it make? To me it mainly looks like a major

The Googlebot likes version one much better. And it is always a good 
idea to make the Googlebot happy. It's also easier for users to read and 
understand so they can get back to a particular page more easily or 
understand what their bookmark says.

So, yeah, there's the whole point about the urls being easier to  
remember.  Also, having your query string out there in the wild  
reveals some things about your implementation to would-be hackers.   
Not that you aren't covering your ass, of course. That's just another  
excuse I've heard for using mod-rewrite.
Another thing is that you aren't revealing the file type you are  
using (php) and thus are making it even harder for someone to know  
how you are generating content.  Of course, someone could just  
inspect the HTTP headers to find out your server is using PHP.  On  
the other hand, if you are using a service to distribute your content  
widely, like a server farm (think Akamai), you now have complete  
ambiguity about what technology you are using.

Also mod_rewrite makes it easier to track stats as well.  For instance 
you may not be able to get stats for index.php?action=Products&prodid=99 
where as you would be able to track stats on /products/99

And while we're all leading the cheer for mod_rewrite, I like to
mention a particular feature that I have found useful: proxy.

With the proxy directive, you can rewrite the URL without notifying
the browser (you're actually "proxying" the url).  So, the user types
in one thing, you can redirect their request somewhere else without
the user suspecting anything.  I use this on search feature for a
website - the searches are conducted on a completely different machine
- but the user still sees the same website and URLs

This may be going beyond the substance of your question, but
mod_rewrite is arguably the best way to enable a
model-view-controller-ish interface for your web application. A simple
rewrite rule, along with some exceptions for static assets (design
elements, javascript libraries), will funnel everything through your
dispatch script.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/www/.*
RewriteRule ^.* /usr/local/myframework/http-engine.php

Now all requests that don't begin with /www/ get handled by one
script, which can give you big savings in the maintenance and security
departments.

Rewriting doesn't change queries at all, btw. You can pick up the
requested uri from the $_SERVER superglobal, and $_GET vars are set
correctly.

Ok, so I'm starting to see the benefits, but now I have to be an Apache
guru on top of a PHP guru? Can anyone suggest good tutorials?

Does this mean I have to change every URL that's embedded in every page
from ?key=value&... to /value1/value2 And do I have to know the order of
the request params for it to work? Or as Chris says, do I still access
the query values from $get, $post?

I don't use a Framework or a true MVC architecture -- I think. It's more
like Cliff's hack. But to my defense, I do use a single entry point
(index.php) that dispatches requests via
?page=somepage&action=someaction&other params as required.

So where would I go from here? And don't say scrap your code and switch
to a Framework.

This may be going beyond the substance of your question, but
mod_rewrite is arguably the best way to enable a
model-view-controller-ish interface for your web application. A simple
rewrite rule, along with some exceptions for static assets (design
elements, javascript libraries), will funnel everything through your
dispatch script.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/www/.*
RewriteRule ^.* /usr/local/myframework/http-engine.php

Now all requests that don't begin with /www/ get handled by one
script, which can give you big savings in the maintenance and security
departments.

Yes you would have to change the links in the page to /value1/value2
and yes you would still access the variables via $_GET, $_POST, & $_REQUEST
all apache does with mod_rewrite is look at the pattern and then in the 
background make the normal ?key=value calls in the background.

So you could use mod_rewrite to switch to urls that look like
http://example.org/somepage?action=someaction, or even
http://example.org/somepage/someaction

Depends on how much re-coding you want to do, and how flexible
"Cliff's hack" needs to be to get the job done.

I use a url scheme that looks like
http://example.org/path/to/some/object.format?action=someaction
The default action is "view" so standard page views require no query string.

Keeping in mind that my focus is on competitive webmastering (where 
different isn't always better, but different that is faster/more 
transparent/easier etc is always better) you aren't stuck with mod 
rewrite and Apache.

As I know Chris Snyder knows very well ;-) there's more than one way to 
code a front controller. Any way you want to achieve a goal of 
satisfying a virtual URL is fine. Of course if it is slow, resource 
intensive, or allows for duplicate URLs for the same content you would 
be better off with mod_rewrite because it's pretty good and accurate. In 
my opinion, at this time, Apache provides the fastest ways to manage the 
URLs of your site, with several options in addition to mod_rewrite (Tom 
Melendez mentioned proxy, I have used files and directory directives, 
and combinations of PHP and all of the above).

One thing I can promise you is that right now, a URL like 
www.example.com/stuff-catalog/Type-one-stuff/bluestuff.html works much 
better than 
www.example.com/index.php?catalog=stuff&stuff_type=1&view='blue' for 
users, search engines, and archives.

And if you research front controllers, an easy path to enlightenment is 
the symfony framework because the code is good and the front controller 
is well planned. However, I personally would not use it because it is 
sub-optimal in the search engine and competitiveness departments. It is 
a good exercise for understanding front controllers, and to see the 
conceptual limitations that come with abstracting a front controller. If 
you are a search optimizer you can use that as the example to beat, 
because it represents a fairly state of the art implementation of a 
framework/front controller (and therefore represents that status quo, 
which is what you need to outperform).

Hope that's helpful. I am not a PHP guru.

Yeah, Cliff.  If all of your pages already follow a standard of 
?page=somepage&action=someaction&other params...

Then you can just drop in this rule:
RewriteRule (.+)/(.+) index.php?page=$1&action=$2 [QSA,L]

And instantly be able to do 
www.somesite.com/sompage/someaction?otherparam=something&etc...
without breaking anything.  You wouldn't even have to change any of your 
existing links immediately if you didn't feel like it... they would 
still work.

Message-ID: <83413726-4434-4FBD-8E6C-728B18F229ED@capellic.com>

I am hoping for some direction here, other efforts have come up  
fruitless.  Thanks in advance!

Here's what we need:

We have files on a Unix web server in various formats, the foremost  
is Word DOC.  We have a script that runs in PHP that gathers all of  
the documents and creates a PDF document stuffs the files in there.   
But the problem is that we can't stuff a Word document into a PDF  
document without first converting it to a PDF.  What I will need to  
be able to do is covert that document via PHP or PHP's command line  
capability (presumably using the exec() command).  We will then  
return control to our compilation script, pull in the newly converted  
file and then we're done.


Thanks,

Stephen Musgrave

Hi Stephen,

Best I've been able to do is get my .doc files into RTF format, and then 
go from RTF to PDF using Ted.  But going from .doc to RTF (or from .doc 
to *anything*) without MS-Word itself (which I presume isn't running on 
your Unix web server) -- that's going to be tough, and probably 
impossible, unless you either have fairly generic page layouts, or 
you're not highly concerned about losing some level of formatting.  And 
still, I'm not aware of any command line tool that will convert files 
from .doc format.

Wish I could offer more, but then I also wish I had *found* more, as I 
too would love to be able to automate conversion from MS-Word to PDF 
without Windows and Word.

- Allen

Message-ID: <C12F0900C695FF47AEE0A7C2C75760A0291C06@greenmonster.supercoups.local>

Hi everyone,
 
I'm attempting to re-code the following example in a PHP equivalent way:
 
http://itextdocs.lowagie.com/examples/com/lowagie/examples/general/webap
p/HelloWorldServlet.java
 
Basically it is a code example from the Java based iText PDF
manipulation library.
 
My final code will be limited by the scripting technology made available
by our Network Solutions hosting package.
 
Thus I am attempting to use a compiled PHP class of the iText library
created with the PHP-Java-Bridge extension as detailed here: 
 
http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/
 
My setup seems to be working properly as the test examples for the
PHP-Java-Bridge work correctly. So I have begun to step into the
programming problem and am stuck on how to replicate the Java
HttpRequest and HttpResponse mechanisms in a PHP way. My first thoughts
were to do this using the PECL HTTP extension and use the HttpRequest
and HttpResponse classes, however I've never coded in an object-oriented
fashion and can't seem to figure out how to use the PECL HTTP extension.
But perhaps I'm going in the wrong direction with how to approach this?
 
Any suggestions would be welcome and greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Tim Boyden

Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20061006135740.02cbafc8@pop.snet.yahoo.com>

Hi,

this question is probably as old as the www. How do I get the GMT bias of 
the system on which the client browser runs? Getting the actual time would 
be even nicer. I'm fine with a solution that works most of the time. I 
thought about figuring out where in the world the IP is located. I recall 
that there are websites that can track an IP to a location (which may or 
may not be correct), but I'd need to handle such a response and then have 
to figure out what the GMT bias is. There must be a more straight forward 
solution. I need to know the client's time on the browser, so it is not 
just about displaying the time in the browser for which JavaScript would be 
the better choice. Any tips?

Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.0.20061006140503.02158180@cfl.rr.com>

I have been successfully running the lite version of XAMPP. I now 
want to upgrade so I can use Mercury Mail for testing, as well as 
adding Perl. I just want to check to see if there is a different 
method for doing it aside from the one I figured out. I am going to 
save the httpd-vhosts.conf and php.ini files (I made several changes 
to them). Then backup the htdocs dir. Then I will delete the 
XAMPPLITE dir and install the XAMPP version, adding back the 
httpd-vhosts.conf and php.ini files and the htdoc directory (a few 
subdirectories actually).

I figured that the httpd-vhosts.conf and php.ini files are the same 
in the full version so I wouldn't have to make all the changes again. 
Does this look correct? Any suggestions?

That sounds like a pain in the ass :-)  Only think I can think of is 
having a Windows machine somewhere that your Unix webserver ftp's the 
files to.  The Windows machine has a scheduled batch program or 
something that periodically checks a folder to see if any doc files are 
in there... runs something like this command line program to do the 
conversion - <http://www.softinterface.com/Convert-Doc/Convert-Doc.htm> 
- and then ftp's the resulting pdf back to your Unix server.  Obviously 
not ideal...

OpenOffice can read Word, output PDF, has an API, and is available for 
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.

Here's someone who did it on a Windows machine:

Doing it on a Unix machine is left as an exercise for the reader (or 
Googler).

Sure it does, with a human operator, but is there any way to do that in 
a batch or from the command line?

Hi,

         looks good to me, but I'd make a copy of the apache config file as 
well unless you are very sure that you didn't change anything in there. 
Mercury Mail is nice, but make sure that it really saves the settings that 
you specified in the GUI. The ini files are somewhat easy to follow. I once 
tried Mercury Mail, configured it all nicely to allow only local accounts 
for testing, but it never saved the settings on clicking Save. Luckily I 
noticed that I was running a spam server before my ISP got aware of it. 
Since then I dropped the idea of running my own mail server.

Does OOo have command line capability? It can open doc files and save them 
right into PDF and OOo can run on Unix. Even if it works, it is still 
pretty ugly.

Sure, but I'm really a publisher and semiconductor sales, marketing, biz

The one of the Apache admin. I feel your pain. I have three degrees, tons 
of experience, am fluent in two languages, and collected skills in tech 
support, programming, technical writing, SQL, HTML, PHP,.....ok, enough 
bragging. As soon as I look for a better job, it all isn't enough, because 
I can't do Java, or C# or something else not on my list. You never wear 
enough hats.

Besides that, when you can figure out semiconductors, then Apache is a 
piece of cake...well, in regards to complexity. I find the apache config 
file easier to grasp than IIS's admin GUI. Even I figured it out and I 
really hate ini files and programming and stuff like that....not enough 
hats, you know.

FWIW, I got offered a great new job exactly because of my combined web

Yeah but I assume that "semiconductor sales" wouldn't be of much use on 
your resume if you were applying for a web developer job and, "apache 
experience" on the other hand *would* be useful in that situation.

I think a lot of us have worn many hats at one time or another - hell, 
Ive done sales and even writing product descriptions for a 
newsletter/catalog (no, not for J Peterman's ;-). But you decide what 
you want to go for and wear the appropriate hat(s) a lot more than the 
'less useful" ones ;-)

At the risk of telling you what you already know, the standard "PHP
way" is to use the $_SERVER, $_GET, and/or $_POST superglobals to
obtain whatever information you need about the request. These are
automatically created when the webserver passes the request to PHP.

PHP sets a few HTTP response headers automatically, which can be
supplemented or overwritten using the header() function. The response
body is simply the output of your script. There is an output buffering
mechanism that can give you control over this. Anything outside of
<?php ... ?> tags will also be part of the response.

Sorry, this may be way too simple an answer, but I can't tell from
your post whether you're new to PHP or if there's some advanced
functionality you're trying to get at.

This might save you some reading and googling:
http://j.crecy.free.fr/index.php/2006/03/01/3-php_word_to_pdf

Description is in French, but the code is English. Apparently you can
connect to the OO.org service manager using a socket. Neat!

The thing is you are creating your own macros *in* OO and then  
running them CLI ... you would need X installed over a normal LAMP  
system still though I beleive ...

This isn't going to appear in any of the headers the browser is going

Nothing in there about the GMT bias.

I think your javascript idea however could be put to a decent use, use
javascript to request a document, write a link to an image or whatever
and send the user's current time that way. then store the information
in a cookie, or their session.

If this is a one-off, or rare requirement, just do an OpenOffice macro
on your local machine, as mentioned elsewhere in the thread.

Otherwise, if you need on the fly conversion, or even scheduled
conversion *on the webserver*, it's a little harder. One solution is
to use PyUNO.

PyUNO: First, this probably will not be possible on a shared server,
unless you can install Open Office, or if there is an OOo process
running and available. You will also need to install Xvfb and run OOo
through that on your server.

http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=19790&highlight=

I suppose since OOo runs on a port, you could run it on your local
desktop box, or something, leaving it always on - I've never tried it.

Essentially the actual conversion involves running a Python script
(via exec(), for example) to communicate with OOo via PyUNO. Too bad
there isn't a php-uno binding or extension - at least some of your
problems would be solved ;)

Yeah, there's no good way to do this other than to have the user's  
browser tell you what it thinks the date/time is.  The Javascript Date 
() object will, by default, return a date string that has the GMT  
offset in it.

Mon Oct 09 2006 10:32:00 GMT-0500 (CDT)

It also has a method called getTimezoneOffset(), which tells you the  
(+/-) minutes away from GMT the browser is.  You could just test the  
value of $_COOKIE in php, redirect to a page that sets a cookie, and  
then go back to the main page.  It sucks, but it works.
<?php
	if(empty($_COOKIE)) {
?>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	var Cookies = {};
	/***
	* @name = string, name of cookie
	* @value = string, value of cookie
	* @days = int, number of days before cookie expires
	***/
	Cookies.create = function (name, value, days) {
	    if (days) {
		var date = new Date();
		date.setTime(date.getTime() + (days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
		var expires = "; expires=" + date.toGMTString();
	    } else {
		var expires = "";
	    }
	    document.cookie = name + "=" + value + expires + "; path=/";
	    this[name] = value;
	}
	var now = new Date();
	Cookies.create("GMT_bias",now.getTimezoneOffset(),7);
	window.location = "<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];?>";
	</script>
<?php
} else {
	echo "<pre>";
	print_r($_COOKIE);
	echo "</pre>";
}
?>


Hope that speeds things up for you.
Billy

Thank you very much for the script code. I did try it out and it indeed 
sets the GMT_Bias in $_COOKIE. So far so good. Being in CT I expected the 
bias to be 300, but it is 240. I also placed myself in different timezones 
and not surprisingly, it comes up with the same result. So, how about 
putting my server back on the East Coast and make my  client now on a 
different PC to be in Germany. As bias I get this time -120 although I 
expected it to be -60. That together makes 360 minutes and that results to 
6 hours difference, which indeed is the correct difference between here and 
Germany.
So I guess what I need to do know is add some protection in case the 
browser does not accept cookies and figure out what my server GMT bias is 
and arrange that with the browser GMT bias to calculate the browser time 
based on the server time and the GMT difference. I probably can do that in 
one go by mashing the biases together and add the positive or negative 
bias. A quick look on the GMT website shows that the 240 and -120 are 
indeed correct due to DST. So I should do some more testing by placing both 
client and server in that week where the US is off in its DST setting 
compared to the rest of the world, which by the way really sucks big time 
when dealing with folks in Germany and the difference is out of a sudden 7 
hours. How was that? By next year it gets even worse as DST in the US lasts 
one month longer than everywhere else. Ah well, now I have a nice script 
that will help me figure this all out. If I just wouldn't have a pesky job 
that takes the best 8 hours of my day......

Thank you very much, that was really nice of you !

I think it is more 2/3 Apache and 1/3 IIS. Which is still 
unbelievable...IMHO IIS rapidly inhales big time.

For the numbers look here: 
http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2006/6/8/4271

Also, some of these many magazines I get at work did quite a thorogh 
comparison between the various stacks for web apps and WAMPP came up on top 
in regards to speed and ease of use. That is in line with my experiences.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Running backtick commands and responding to stdout/in
Message-ID: <000501c6ec0e$fb1c7000$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hey all,

I am attempting to run ssh (w/out the ssh2 module) by backticking commands 
from the command line.

$result = `ssh -l $userStr $hostStr`;

This line causes the script to display the enter password and php seems to 
let it go right to stdin/console.
Is there any way for php to catch this (since I know its comming) and enter 
the password?

Or must I install the ssh2 module and call ssh2_connect( )?

Thanks!

- Ben

You can do this a few different ways, but probably the most
straightforward is to use proc_open (http://php.net/proc_open).

This lets you define file descriptors for stdin, stdout and stderr so
you can do some pretty complex interaction with external programs.

Message-ID: <452B9185.7070205@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

Someone was proposing sending PDFs containing sensitive info over email. 
  I was thinking of recommending against it, citing the lack of security 
in the POP/IMAP protocols.  Is that a legitimate concern?

An alternative would be to email them with a link to the PDF which would 
be protected with a login system (That's where the PHP would come in).

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Oh, just a little concern! :)

A few years ago, I wrote an http file transfer system, where you would upload
a file via a ssl form, and the system would give you a url containing convoluted
dir names to grab the file. This way, a bot couldn't 'guess' the full path, and
we would remove the file after 24 hrs. All this in PHP, of course. If you are 
interested, I think I still have the source kicking around somewhere. It wasn't
nice code, or a lot of it, but it worked for the client.

POP/IMAP is used when you connect your mail client (MUA) to the server
to send and retrieve mail.  It can be very secure, most clients I have
used allow you to check the TLS/SSL box to encrypt the initial and
subsequent conversations with a mail server (MDA).

SMTP is used to route mail from server to server (MTA) over the
internet. This is where your mail will fly naked.

You may want to consider encrypt the mail at the source and decrypt at
the target. Not only does this method secure the message it also
handles the 'other' concern in security:  the sender is who he says he
is.

MUA = mail user agent 		(thuderbird, sylpheed, etc)
MDA = mail delivery agent	(courier-imap, dovecot, etc)
MTA = mail transfer agent	(postfix, sendmail, etc)

Wikipedia can give a good overview of email protocols.. read it.

Sending emails with large attachments (images, spreadsheets, pdfs, etc)
is really not a good practice, and frankly, pretty annoying.  Your idea
of just sending the link and hosting the documents on a server is a
preferred method (well done!).  It is much less hassle to set up -and-
you get the added bonus of being able to make corrections and additions
to the document (are they ever done right the first time? [grin]). You
only have to repost to the web and not resend to all the target
recipients.  Not to mention.. you don't have to teach them PGP/GPG.

Sure, but only if you make sure the solution is actually more secure.

And how did they get their username/password in the first place?  Via 
unencrypted email?  See what I'm saying?

If you send usernames/passwords via snail mail, and then have people login 
over https, that's pretty good security.  But if the passwords are going 
out over email anyway, you might as well send the sensitive document via 
email too.

I don't see desktop applications as an enemy, but rather as a means 
to fulfill single user specific need. If one wants everyone to "work" 
together then web applications are certainly a solution. However, 
both solutions have trade-offs and mutually exclusive 
advantages/disadvantages.

I hope php programmers will be busy for many years, but many of the 
languages that I sunk my teeth into have passed on to the big null in 
the sky.

The web is not just websites. There are plenty of ways to communicate on 
the web without using HTML. Desktop applications can be used to help 
people work together just as well as (and in some cases more effectively 
and efficiently than) web apps. Don't dismiss the desktop app as "the 
old way". After all, its a desktop app (web browser) that makes all web 
apps even possible. Also, don't forget that desktop apps can be written 
entirely with PHP!

Depending on the situation, you could use SSH with key-based
authentication instead of passwords, which would avoid the issue. But
then you have to make sure your script (and the account that runs it)
are both secure.

But still, among the "active domains", the number is 61% Apache. I think 
if a domain returns a page, it is "active" regardless of whether it is a 
"parked" page or some ad page.

So a static site should not be counted? That doesn't make sense.

Netcraft look at the actual headers returned from an HTTP connection to 
a site - dont see anything wrong with sampling this way (at least, 
there's no humans involved and the whole thing is automated).

Not yet, but O'Reilly is pretty good about translating books, if there's
sufficient demand for it. (Which I imagine is the case, but that's

Yes, but from the way I read it, this is only an issue if you
unserialize a string directly from user input. The authors give the
example of an application that serializes some structure and stores it
in a cookie value for deserialization on subsequent requests.

The attack is based on constructing a fake serialized string that
includes an array with a very large number of reported elements,
something like "a:9999999999999999:{...}".

I wouldn't be surprised to find that unserialize() is vulnerable to
other, similar attacks, so if you're code is affected by this it would
be much better to use some other mechanism (storing a record id in the
cookie, or using php sessions). Or use hardened php, apparently.

I want to evaluate the expression $x * $y (x times y). But when I run it thru the eval() function it returns "3 * 4" instead of "12". It seems to interpret * as a string instead of a multiplication operator. Any suggestions greatly appreciated

I haven't had my coffee yet, but I would guess that it has something to do
with those single quotes.

But there's a bigger question here:  Why do you want to store the expression
in a string?  Just store the $x and the $y, and multiply them when you have
to.  If there's some larger issue at hand, like you have to read the
expressions from a file or something, use the regexp functions to get the
two operands and the operator, and then do the math you have to do.

hhmm an O'reilly book on php design patterns probably a good read. If 
you are looking for a 'php patterns' book now and don't want to wait for 
a translation I recommend:

http://www.amazon.com/PHP-5-Objects-Patterns-Practice/dp/1590593804/sr=8-17/qid=1160663568/ref=sr_1_17/102-3315688-6676925?ie=UTF8&s=books

Great overview of php 5 language constructs, uml, and various design 
patterns with great examples ( several based on Sid Mier's 
Civilization). Haven't read the pattern book from PHP | Architect so 
can't comment on it.

Enjoy,
-Morgan

The reason I used literal string is because that's how it is used on the official PHP site at http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php

Also, in my haste I supplied a slightly incorrect example (apologies), it shoul be:

<?php
  $calc_str = '$x * $y';
  $x = 3;
  $y = 4;
  eval("echo \"$calc_str\";");
?>

Where the calc_str comes first at design time, while $x and $y are determined at run time. With this restriction using double quotes "$x * $y" in the proposed solution below will not work either.

Again, if you know at design time what math needs to be done, then all you
need to store are the arguments.  I think this code can be simpler than you
want it to be.

The reason I don't want to use regexp is because eventually I want to have an arbitrary formula for $calc_str, and I don't want to design my own evaluation compiler with regexp - that's what eval() is supposed to do, or so it seems.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR Error Message
Message-ID: <20061012153133.E74FFA87CB@virtu.nyphp.org>

I have received the following PEAR error message, but can't interpret it
because there are many places where I am using a 'get':

MESSAGE: DB_DataObject Error: No Value specified for get
TYPE: PEAR
DEBUG INFO: 
CODE: -1

I have also tried bracketing the error, but that has not been helpful to
this point.

I recognize the Code = -1 as a failure signal, but the challenge is that
there is no debug information accompanying it.  The framework (Seagull) log
gives no indication of an error.  Have I failed to set an appropriate
parameter to allow Debug Info to display, does PEAR have a unique log I am
not seeing, or is there another way to investigate this error?

Many thanks for your help.

Great! - I just bought this book before reading your message so that's 
good to know. I also bought O'Reilly's "Head First" patterns book and 
"AJAX and PHP"  (http://www.packtpub.com/ajax_php/book).

you can escape the $ in double quotes to represent the literal $var instead of the variable $var - "\$x * \$y"

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Andromeda Presentation: Ideas for sample app?
Message-ID: <452E8529.2040000@secdat.com>

Hello everyone,

In a couple of weeks I will be presenting Andromeda, a framework for 
line-of-business apps.

I am hoping to do a lot of hands-on stuff, with lots of code to show, 
and lots of examples.

If anybody would like to suggest a sample app, I would be happy to do 
what I can to have something prepared that is relevant to conversations 
we have here.  Can't promise anything of course, but I think that if 
some ideas come in it will let us show off some of things Andromeda 
does.  If something suitable is suggested and worked out here, I will 
have the app working before the presentation so people can go look at it.

The current plan is to show a time-tracking system and a fragment of a 
magazine distribution system.  If anybody has other ideas for such 
line-of-business stuff, please feel free to reply here or off-list.

I should say that there are certain apps that are very well done by 
other systems out there, so for instance we would not present a CMS or a 
messageboard.

Is your signature call the same (or can you sed it out + append), you
can try appending something like 

echo __FILE__ .':' . __LINE__; 

Before the call.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR Error Message

I have received the following PEAR error message, but can't interpret it
because there are many places where I am using a 'get':

MESSAGE: DB_DataObject Error: No Value specified for get
TYPE: PEAR
DEBUG INFO:
CODE: -1

I have also tried bracketing the error, but that has not been helpful to
this point.

I recognize the Code = -1 as a failure signal, but the challenge is that
there is no debug information accompanying it.  The framework (Seagull)
log gives no indication of an error.  Have I failed to set an
appropriate parameter to allow Debug Info to display, does PEAR have a
unique log I am not seeing, or is there another way to investigate this
error?

Many thanks for your help.

You have an echo problem, not an eval problem.

$x = 2;
$y = 3;

echo "Basic string interpolation: ";
echo "$x * $y";
echo "<br/>evaluate and echo results: ";
echo $x * $y;
echo "<br/>See?";

Since the echo statement you're eval'ing has a single argument, a
double-quoted string, PHP does the string interpolation.  string
interpolation does not evaluate expressions in the string, it simply
converts variable names to the data they contain.

If you pass an expression to echo, however, PHP will evaluate the
expression, and output the result as a string.

Stick something like
DB_DataObject::debugLevel(5);

in a global config file, and then scan the output until you see
something red.

Were you looking for where the call was failing?  

I normally append that before the call to pinpoint where the function
was called, but im sure there is a debug level you can set for PEAR to
get more.

As Tim points out DB_DataObject::debugLevel(5); should definatley work.

APD is great to use (if you can compile/install it) though for debugging
all around .. http://pecl.php.net/package/apd

Thanks for making the attempt to bring me up to speed, but this issue
appears to be beyond my level.  I certainly understand the concept of
configuration files and have edited them, but to my way of thinking there
would be only one active PEAR configuration file.  When I reviewed the PEAR
Manual, I saw how configuration directives could be written, but could get
no sense for where the file was located/what it was named.  I came to the
conclusion that I really didn't understand "Stick something like
DB_DataObject::debugLevel(5); in a global config file" and I appreciate that
if I can't understand that, I am over my head.

Again, thanks for trying.

Just when I thought I was completely over my head, I decided to place the
suggested statement in the PHP script in which the original error message
occurred.  That worked and the end of the debug message included the
following lines:

DataObjects_Info_item: GET: item_no Array ( [0] => item_no ) 
DataObjects_Info_item: ERROR: No Value specified for get

I would interpret that as an error caused by item_no not being defined at
that point.  That would make sense, although I will need some time to come
up with a correction.

Again, thanks to both of you for both your help and your patience.

Hi!

I've been asked to find out how much a contract programmer would cost for 6
months worth of work.  This (at this point theoretical work) would be for
several PHP/MySQL/Apache projects, it would require on site work, working
9-5.. We'd need this person on site, so telecommuting would not be
acceptable.

Thanks!

Hi,

	this may be a bit off topic, because it is really related to HTML, but I 
figured anyone doing PHP most likely knows HTML as well and often can't do 
without it. Well, here it goes.

I have a page that contains three navigation buttons. Each button is inside 
its own form together with a hidden input and each form calls the same 
script. The hidden input basically just passes on a value via post. The 
buttons each act submit buttons for the forms. Maybe the code shows this 
better, so I attached it below. I also added some non breaking spaces to 
make some room between the buttons.

My intention is to have all three buttons in one row, but they appear in 
three paragraphs sort of and that is not what I want. So, how do I get 
these buttons to be in the same row without using a table, which supposedly 
is a big no no for page layout. I looked around and sources recommend div 
tags, which I find to be excrutiatingly annoying to use. So, any ideas on 
how to get the result the easy way?


		Thanks in advance,

I believe that this article gives you the divs layout setup and the CSS
styles in a basic form exactly as you might need:
http://alistapart.com/articles/holygrail

I wouldn't hassle yourself with any other unique strategies.
Divs are solid performers and every modern browser essentially handles them
quite right.
You can try something like:

<div id="main_div" class="main">
<div id="f1" class="form1">form 1 elements</div><div id="f2"
class="form2">form 2 elements</div><div id="f3" class="form3">form 3
elements</div>
</div>

Using CSS you can make the position for main_div = absolute.
Then position it with left and top. And even hard code the width to say 360.
And then the internal divs can be relative or float, something like that.

Or just use this:
<div id="f1" class="form1">form 1 elements</div><div id="f2"
class="form2">form 2 elements</div><div id="f3" class="form3">form 3
elements</div>

And then use CSS to absolutely position all three. And set each width to say
120px.
And set the left and tops as 0,0 and 120,0 and 240,0.

Yea, that is what I don't see as "user friendly" when it comes to div. I 
have no idea where on the page these forms may end up, so I can't specifiy 
pixels or such. Maybe that article reveals more, but I really just want it 
to attach itself to what there is above on the same page. I want to 
position the buttons relative to each other, not relative to the page itself.

I did look briefly at divs some time ago and found it to be useful when one 
wants to have centered and right justified text on the same row. Can't do 
that any other way.

Maybe it is just one of these things where I need to push myself over the 
cliff. I did that with CSS and it is less scary now, but still IMHO more 
work than inline formatting.

By the way did you check if three forms just dropped in a div and each form
separated by a non-breaking space symbol &nbsp; 
might give you what you need?

OR

Try instead the same listapart site for this simpler CSS technique for 
floating elements in a group setting:
http://alistapart.com/articles/practicalcss/


Or 

Examine these tuts closely and you may find a solution, such as the floating
an image and caption:
http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/


Dreamweaver.

Another possible solution to the whole thing is to just use a named  
variable inside of the submit itself + switch on that instead of  
using 3 form blocks:

<form method="post" action="form.php">
<input name="submit" value="back" type="submit" />
&nbsp;
<input name="submit" value="next" type="submit" />
&nbsp;
<input name="submit" value="home" type="submit" />
</form>

I do the exact same thing with buttons. But I don't use divs. All you need is
some css that lets each form float the the right of the preceeding form. Just
make a class like formfloat and then assign that class to the appropriate buttons.

Before you work with that article, be sure and consider the errata

It will save you some headaches, and maybe influence your commitment.

Barring any big search /SEO news, there's a post appearing on my blog at 
johnon.com on the 15th that points at a few CSS resources that are IE7 
compliant and fundamental (box models and such),  plus good from a 
search engine optimization perspective. No big deal but  might also save 
some hassles as CSS is a huge  area on the web, and IMHO that ALA 
article is not your answer.

Sorry... it's now slated for the 17th but again, it's no big deal... 
just a blog post :

http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/
http://www.cssplay.co.uk/
http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/menu_gallery.html

"But I will suggest that if you look hard enough you will find plenty of 
quality CSS resources that are on the edge of /practical/ efficiency (as 
opposed to the theoretical edge of CSS, which I can't appreciate in my 
competitive work). A few resources I really enjoy are cssplay.co.uk 
<http://www.cssplay.co.uk> for ideas (I liked it better before it got to 
3.3 million page views per month, alas) and Layout Gala 
<http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/> for box models.

I know I will regret sending competitive webmasters to these resources, 
but did you get a load of Stu Nicholls latest CSS-only gallery script 
<http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/menu_gallery.html>? It's simply 
beautiful. Another photographer working in CSS and it really shows. And 
if you have any SEO sense about you look at the code. Add a Flash top 
nav bar and it's SEO heaven!
"

PS: We are way overdue for a talk on NYPHP gallery scripts... ModX 
LightBox and some of the cool new CSS ones are awesome....

Yes!! This is what I was hoping for. Sweet, small, easy and on a level that 
I can comprehend. Look Ma! No DIVs needed!

This is so straight forward that I am really annoyed that I didn't figure 
this out myself.

Thank you very very very much! This makes my day and hopefully will get me 
through the trip to the IKEA store. :7

To make it even better, separate the control logic from the
presentation. That way, back could be reverse, etc. I do this in all my
forms since application logic and presentation "word play" are two
distinct things to me. This is what I use:

<form method="post" action="form.php">
<input name="submit[back]" value="reverse" type="submit" />
&nbsp;
<input name="submit[next]" value="speed ahead" type="submit" />
&nbsp;
<input name="submit[home]" value="no place like home" type="submit" />
</form>

Then, you can have a simple routine that captures submit actions
regardless of the presentation value. You check for the array submit --
count 1 and whitelist against the acceptable values. A multi-row table
can expand upon the theme by using this: submit[edit_3],
submit[delete_3]m submit[edit_5], etc.

Yes, but since I have to do a comparison in the target script anyway, what 
difference does it make if I do a string compare with 'home' or 'no place 
like home'.

Uh! Wait! Phase 6 of my project lists internationalization.....can't do it 
the way I have it now unless I want to add cases for every language string 
out there. Point well taken!
So I guess with a simple isset() on the array element I get what I need 
without worrying what the value is. This is so clever!

Really nice example that shows what people mean when they talk about 
seperating presentation from logic. I never got this until today. Thank you 
for this quick lesson!

How come that you guys know all this? You must read books and attend 
classes 24x7.

EXACTLY! And never mind internationalization, what happens when Mr. Marketing
tells you 'back' should be 'go back' or 'search' should be 'go'... Do you
really want to change your application logic every time you have to do this?

Another point regarding wrapping the buttons in one form. You may very well
need three forms because each button could potentially require different
hidden variables. A "Button Factory" function that creates a self-contained
button with hidden elements, form action, etc. can be very useful. You just
drop it into the presentation layer...

Hello All,

I'm currently working on a gig that requires end users the ability to RSVP

I wanted to know if there is a tested and trusted open source (php please) 
option?

Does anyone have background using the software, complaints or comments?

I would like php because I can edit and expand that language most easily 
(plus this is the PHP LIST!) = ]

Thanks!

This is a new error notice that was added in php 4.4. You or your  
host must have just upgraded php to 4.4.

The notice is generated for any functions that attempt to return the  
value of an expression as a reference. Apparently it doesn't work and  
the returned value will not be a reference, so the notice was added  
in php 4.4. PEAR Mail_Mime may have been have been updated to fix  
this problem. Make sure you upgrade to the latest version.

Here's more info on the new notice:

http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/07/30/php-44-minor-gotcha/

I'm curios to hear how others have been dealing with this issue. It's  
cause a lot of what I thought was well written code to start  
generating notices, (which in my mind are errors).

Interesting. But I am running 5.1.6 and have been running 5+ for some time.
Maybe installing 5.1.6 changed my php.ini ENOTICE setting?

But don't most factory patterns use return by refernce as in something like

if ...
  return new objectA
elseif
  return new objectB
else
  return new objectC

This would seem to create the same problem -- right?

I have the latest version of mail_mime and it still generates errors.
I just modified the code, because I like E_NOTICE on during development.
But I also changed my error handler to add the error type as follows:

Error number: 8 
Error type: e_notice

Error number: 8 is meaningless to me -- and scary. Error type: e_notice
is meaningful and lets me sleep better.

All,

A bit off-top, but Steven M. Bellovin is a highly regarded security author
and internet expert - one of the great internet old timers.  Probably his
best known book:

http://www.wilyhacker.com/

Web application security and internet security go hand in hand and you can't
have the former without the later, so perhaps this is on-topic.

See you there,

I am trying to get my php runnig in one of my red hat systems
and I notice that I am missing php-mysql.so.  I do have this file
on my failover system(same red had OS).

Can I just copy the php-mysql.so from one system to the other?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Question Re: Intranet PHP central authentication???
Message-ID: <45338BFD.9080001@fdcx.net>

Gentlemen;

Subscribing and reading this list for some time now there is quite a bit 
of very valuable and useful info coming across.

I value your professional responses and would like to call upon them at 
this time?

In my position as primary designer/developer I have been challenged with 
designing/developing a new central authentication facility/mechanism for 
all applications on our Intranet.   We run several departments/divisions 
that have access to both their own unique and common apps, all delivered 
via Apache.

Currently each has its own style/type of authentication and 
authorizations and it has become very cumbersome and very unmanageable.

I thought with this new challenge I could wipe the slate clean and 
design something that could be used for all new development and apps and 
also be retro fit into the old apps over time.

Therefore I was wondering what other firms are doing to address this out 
there?   Immediately I can come up with a multitude of ways, but what is 
the norm?  What is the standard?  what is scalable and trasportable?

It is important to know that we are a 100% Linux and OSS shop with the 
exception of some 3rd party software and what ever is done must continue 
using oss.

I was thinking of an LDAP solution and creating one or more php modules 
to allow central access (i.e.: an app requires user authentication:  it 
includes_once or exec's the central module to accomplish then and stores 
a returned token or something with the session to determine successful 
authentication and permissions.

I would appreciate ANY ideas that any of you may have to address this 
and links to any sampes, templates, etc that would help.

Thank you again for any and all recommendations you can provide.

Bob

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Resolving Bus Errors
Message-ID: <460A7B4D-3E3E-4928-A70D-1354F573212C@sala.ca>

How should one go about resolving php bus errors and segfaults?

I have a script that produces a bus error when I run it under my php4  
setup, but runs fine under my php5. It appears that script becomes  
unstable after invoking the built-in xml parser with  
xml_parser_create (which is used behind the scenes in PEAR's  
XML_Serializer). After that point, calls to file related functions,  
like fopen() or file(), may or may not result in a bus error.

I've tried to reproduce the problem in an isolated context, but  
without success. Should I even try to resolve this by modifying my  
php scripts, or am I just trying to catch a ghost? Is there a way to  
isolate these problems to come up with a work-around? Are there  
specific things one should look for that might be contributing to the  
instability, like not calling fclose() or xml_parser_free(), or  
something like that?

If I have a table with fields roughly like:

I would like to do a select that would give me output grouped like so
(including the quantity):
 
United States (1589)

My workplace is primarily a Windows shop (on the workstation side of
things), so LDAP was a natural solution as we already use Active
Directory to manage user accounts. Active Directory is Microsoft's
implementation of LDAP.

Here's the code I use (as part of an authenticate( $username,
$password ) method):

        if ( $ad = ldap_connect( 'ldap://'.$ldap_host.'/' ) ) {
          $adusername = $ldap_domain.'\\'.$username;
          if ( @ldap_bind($ad, $username, $password) ) {
            ldap_unbind( $ad );
            $this->log( "User $username authenticated via LDAP." );
            return TRUE;
          }
        }
        return FALSE;

That's ActiveDirectory specific (note the DOMAIN\USERNAME syntax) but
you'd do essentially the same thing with any other LDAP.

If you're building your own from scratch, the biggest hurdle seems to
be finding or creating a good interface for user/group administration.
Authentication is the easy part!

Out of my league, but you may want to look at what Yale has in place for 
single sign on /central auth of web apps/services:

I think I saw something very much like this on a website here:

you may have to look around a bit.

Some say "Science is fact. Religion is faith. Magic is perception". I wonder, if what you witness is not reality, but your perception of reality, do you trust your perceptions as truth? Does that make the so-called scientist a religious magician?  --John Andrews Competitive Webmaster and SEO Blogging at http://www.johnon.com

Hey all, I need to parse data from pages which are behind a login.  Does
anyone know how to do this? I'm kind of unfamiliar with HTTP protocol and
new to PHP, so anything at all will be helpful.

(there is an http_request function listed on php.net, but the entry is
sparse and I can't find any example code for it)

thanks so much,
   Rob

I assume you're using MySQL?

select count(ID), COUNTRY from tablename group by country;

Hope that helps!

If I have a table with fields roughly like:

ID NAME ADDRESS CITY STATE COUNTRY

I would like to do a select that would give me output grouped like so
(including the quantity):

United States (1589)
    New York (1200)
    Los Angeles (200)
    Dallas (189)
Maldives (1)
France (123)
    Paris (111)
    Bordeaux (9)
    Orleans (3)

etc.

Thanks in advance if you've got this at your fingertips.

If it's straight-up HTTP authentication (the kind where a standard
dialog box pops up in the browser asking for a username and password),
you can probably access it using something like:

$data = file_get_contents(
"http://username:password at example.com/path/to/data" );

If it's session-based authentication that was implemented in php or
some other server-side language, you'll need to POST a login form,
capture the session identifier (usually a cookie), and pass it back to
the server with each request.

Do you know where I might be able to find some sample code/walkthrough for
the latter (POST)?

Hi,

         is this a standard login or a login within a form? You may try the 
username:password at URL format. That works for FTP, maybe it works for HTTP 
as well.

                 Just a guess and worth a try,

                         David K.

You might try this class:
http://scripts.incutio.com/httpclient/index.php

I've never used it, no idea if it is secure or not, but it seems to do
what you're looking for...

Any idea if it is posting or getting the form data? With a get you can 
craft the call to script fairly easily by passing the user name and 
password as parameters. Other than that...http_request...ah, yes, you 
already know about that one. This is getting a bit too advanced for me, but 
you may want to google for this as well.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Successor to the Web?
Message-ID: <20061018125434.E74CEA8774@virtu.nyphp.org>

I am sorry if this question appears to be off-topic, but perhaps someone can
refer me to the correct forum.  I had programmed in approximately a dozen
languages previously before dabbling in PHP a couple years ago.  Now that
PHP 5 is truly object-oriented, I find it to be the most powerful of the
languages with which I am familiar.  As remarkable as the Web is, I am
coming to the conclusion that it has some severe limitations for the kinds
of complex applications that were the standard in the client/server days.  I
know that going back to client/server is not the answer and suspect that
somewhere someone is working on an Internet-based system that could
ultimately replace the page-oriented Web.  Can anybody point me in that
direction?

My primary concern with the Web is that it seems to be a force-fit of
page-orientation and statelessness to structured programming/object
orientation, which I find to be inherently task-oriented.  Applications that
depend heavily upon related records require that users perform all kinds of
browses.  Under those circumstances, managing communication among objects
becomes a nightmare because it requires the application programmer to
predict communication paths to objects and manually handle session variables
that are not task-scoped (they are by definition, session-scoped).  It
appears to me that there is a role for session variables, but it is not the
task.

The force-fit described above is particularly apparent when programming in
an MVC and validate/process/display workflow environment.  While many
programmers have reservations about the need for these disciplines, it has
been my experience that they become increasingly important as the size and
complexity of an application system increases.

Any thoughts will be appreciated.

Hi,

         I do not know of any particularly good sources that cover this 
topic. I just wonder what is wrong with client/server? After all, a browser 
and an http server is nothing else than a client/server structure in the 
classical sense. And with JavaScript the browser is becoming more a fat 
client. I personally prever a fat client as it allows a far better 
distribution of processing power. The browsers come around and do a lot of 
that with the XML/XSLT deal that puts the presentation tasks entirely in 
the lap of the browsers (which may not be a good thing in case of broken 
browsers like IE).

         One of the biggest limitations that I see in regards to the 
web/internet is that it is still too slow for heavy duty applications (or 
speedy connections are too expensive for the casual consumer use), that it 
is still too different from the fat clients, and that it is just too much 
of client/server (stateless). I work and worked on both fat client/server 
projects as well as web based projects and they each have their place. And 
each of them are by far not at the end of what can be done, one good 
example is the rising of AJAX, which combines technologies that are around 
for years and years already. I personally don't see the need to replace fat 
clients and the page oriented web. The page limitations are a good thing 
and make the developers think more. Why do we need a Web 3.0 when the vast 
majority cannot even properly handle Web 0.0.1beta? That is the same reson 
why many big companies still runn their mainframes using COBOL. Sure, that 
it so 60s, but it is well understood and just plain works. Can't say that 
about the next big thing after that, the (Windows) client/server.

         Depending on the tasks to be accomplished, going back to what you 
call "client/server" is in my opinion a very good idea. Far too many 
applications are being browser based or web enabled these days that clearly 
are way to complex and heavy to be handled by a dinky browser and a handful 
of markup code regardless of the new avenues with Ruby, AJAX, or PHP. I 
really lost you on the demand for a "new web". If the browser based 
approach does not work for the complex applications, there are solutions 
available that do the trick and when done right they do it quite well.

         Just my 2 ?.

There's an interesting article beginning a series at developerWorks which 
shares and addresses some of your concerns (using new technologies to 
eliminate the page-based Web while still adhering to the Web's fundamental 
roots):

I hope you can come by and see the Andromeda presentation on Tuesday, 
because Andromeda is my answer to the questions you raise. 

Some of the answers I have come to lead me to call Andromeda the 
"un-framework", because the aim is very different from the MVC 
frameworks out there, in that I'm trying to preserve assets across 
architecture changes, and OO does not seem to be the way to do it, IMHO.

But be careful here.  PHP 5 is subject to the Iron Law of Programming 
Languages: This Too Shall Pass.  Therefore, the answer to a changing 
world architecture cannot be found in a language, because languages have 
a tendency to become powerful when there platform is growing, and to 
become weak as their platform wanes (Cobol for timeshare, visual foxpro 
for LAN, VB for C/S...)

To preserve assets in a form that can be usable by any language on any 
platform requires that they be stored in a form that is easily 
transmutable, and this so happens to be data.  If your crucial business 
rules are stored in data, so that code can be generated, you have made a 
huge practical leap not just towards platform-independence, but towards 
architecture-independence.

This results when the application is designed around coding principles 
and the database is expected to conform.  Databases and programs have 
very different purposes and follow very different rules for virtuous design.

Experience with customers leads to the conclusion that the guys who sign 
the checks pay for valid data, not UIs (the UI is important and is 
expected to work, but the database is what gets the attention).  This 
becomes more true the larger the company.  Therefore it seems only 
practical to design a framework based on the need to maintain valid 
data.   I'll skip the detail on this point because that will be the main 
substance of the presentation on Tuesday.

If you follow this line of reasoning, you end up concentrating first on 
getting the database specification to be complete and correct.  Once 
this is done, the browser layer tends to come next in importance because 
of its role in user acceptance and productivity.  This leaves to last, 
surprisingly, the PHP layer, serving as "mere" glue between the browser 
and the database.   Because most frameworks begin with trying to 
establish coding practices for the PHP layer, which we can see here as 
being the least important, it is no surprise that they end up looking 
like a "force-fit" in the big picture.

My experience is that *some* sort of method is required, but that 
programming discipline is not the silver bullet, which is why I looked 
elsewhere and developed Andromeda, which is more about getting a 
complete database specification and implementing it with as little 
effort as possible.

Maybe we just have very strong blinders on.  :-)

HTTP was designed for a certain flavor of application, the kind that
involves discrete requests for content-bearing resources on remote
servers.

It turns out you can build a helluva lot of useful stuff with it,
especially if you add a session mechanism and start
automating/scripting the requests.

But just because you _can_ build an application by cobbling together
all these technologies, doesn't mean you _should_.

I think the SecondLife example is a good one. Cyberspace made real.

I also think that virtualization has made it a snap to create
application "kiosks" where you use a VNC client rather than a web
browser to connect to and interact with a system, even if (especially
if!) that system is running on your own workstation.

For me, lists like this are a great place to get new ideas, as are

Whatever works will replace the web, one piece at a time. Just because 
people didn't understand how free information (truthful or not) would 
change their lives (and so they adopted the web), people don't know what 
else they need, either. Somebody has to show it to them (one piece at a 
time).

It seems you are saying you want to build complex applications, and 
don't think PHP/web is a good way to do that. Seems clear. But if you 
are trying to bring those complex apps to the people, people are (right 
now) using the web.

Yes, doing it that way is hard. Much harder than it looks. Harder than 
people think it is. But it is also hard to travel around as a salesman, 
pitching Ginzu knives at mall cooking kiosks, flea markets, and Wal-mart 
stores 300 days per year. But somebody does that, and I met one guy who 
made a million bucks doing that in one year. All we see is some guy at 
the mall giving a great demo of a cheap knife cutting through a coke 
can. We have no idea how much work he does to bring that show around... 
and I doubt we care very much. As soon as he has a better way to cut out 
the middle man and keep 80% of his sales,  I'm sure he'll choose that 
method.

I think you're seeing programmers (technicians) relying on tools (which 
they have to do, to keep up). "The best tool for the job" , is sometimes 
really "the best avalable tool for the job, as the customer understands 
the job". As you know, there is a difference.

Message-ID: <3503e561a956764ef4b7e5dbe1398d70@jobsforge.com>

Just want to bounce this off the OO gurus:

Say you have a User object and sometimes you want to create existing 
users and other times new users.

So you instantiate the object:

$user = new User($username)

and the object recognizes the user and grabs all the user data from the 
DB. . .or

$user = new $User()

and the object creates a new user in the db

but constructors don't return values so there is no way to test that 
the second case in fact succeeded.

So I'm thinking I must create a method like:

public function init() {
      if ( $this->username == NULL) {
          createUser()
     } else {
         //get user data from db with $username
     }
}

so I can test whether my initilaization is successful.


That's fine. Just seems cumbersome to create a new object and ALWAYS 
follow with a given method.
I thought that's what constructors were for.

And I know they are. What's the preferred methodology here?

Thanks

I think it's good practice to keep actions out of the constructor. I
typically end up wanting to change configuration or set some
properties before I start calling methods on an object, maybe months
or years after writing the class.

$user = new User();
$user->useLDAP( $server, $domain );
$user->load( $username );

If the constructor starts doing stuff on instantiation, then you're
potentially cut off from flexibility down the line.

Second Life is cool, but comparing it to teh interweb is not very  
enlightening.   Second life is maintained by a private company, and  
you need their client on your computer to connect to their world.   
They are in control.  With the web, nobody is really in control.   
Sure, new standards seem to take ages to be adopted by a majority of  
browsers (SVG? UML? CSS3?),  but at least we are free to use whatever  
browser to access the web.
ANother thing that the web has over a virtual world like second life  
is that it is (at the moment) much more practical for purposes like  
online shopping, searching, downloading documents, images, movies,  
etc.  Everybody touts the economy of second life as pretty cool, and  
it is a cool thing - but it pales in comparison to the $$ spent on  
the web as a whole.
RIght now, most major sites rely on some type of server farm to  
balance loads, so when they get like 10,000,000 hits in one hour,  
they can handle it ok.  Second Life, OOTO, can't handle 60 avatars on  
the same sim. It really, really hurts performance.
As far as having a virtual world instead of a flat, http world to  
browse, well hell, I would use that for sure.  That is, if my 5 year  
old G4 could handle that sort of crap (which it can't).

I think you've got the right idea. Loading the user data should occur  
outside the constructor so you can check for success.

A little off topic:

It looks like your moving towards a DataObject pattern and if you  
haven't explored this already it's worth a look. DataObjects  
typically have something like a get() method, or a find() method  
which is called after the object has been instantiated.

$user = new DataObject('user');
$user->get($userId);

When you instantiate the DataObject, it's just an empty shell. You  
either do a get() or find() to load data into the shell, or you  
populate it with your own data and then insert it into the db:

$user = new DataObject('user');
$user->setName('John');
$user->setAge(34);
$user->insert();

Here's a good article that covers the basics:

Very true. People use web just as a part of fulfilling their requirements. 
That is why they don't pay much attention towards how they are being served. 
As soon as their purposes are fulfilled, they stop using web and continue 
doing other stuffs. Since they are not much aware of technologies on which 
web applications have been built and running, we can't rely much on their  
opinion to bring changes. Hence it is mostly our efforts to make any changes 
that we think it needs to bring.

Web is made of lot of components like protocols, browsers, markup languages 
etc. where some of them are not co-ordinated or there lacks standardization 
of communication between client and server.

Answer of this question lies in bringing changes in the way Web works by 
applying certain standards (communication, information interchange etc.) 
between applications. So client-server technology, according to me, can be 
replaced with client-agent-server technology where client and server do not 
communicate directly with each other like it is now.

Agents will be similar like desktop application (like email clients etc.) that 
will fetch information from various servers according to user's requirement, 
will process those information and will finally present to user in easier 
way. But it is needs standardization between different servers about how to 
request query and fetch results.

This can be explained best with the example of "Flight booking" system. For 
example a user wants to book a flight between 2 cities. Traditionally, at 
this moment, user has to go to various websites (in normal case, unless 
he/she has chosen single website as a favorite one) and browse various pages, 
fill in required information like source, destination, date, type of trip  
etc. ti book the flight. If user is not satisfied with date-time or fare 
he/she has to do almost same thing over other website.

Here assume that we have an Agent application (assume "Flight booker" 
software) that can reside on client side that will have a common form to be 
filled up. Once required information is filled in, application will query 
different servers of airlines (using XML etc.) to obtain information that 
matches criteria of requirement, will fetch related information from there, 
if matches, and will present to user for further processing. But this system 
needs co-ordination and standardization between those airlines about how to 
avail information in standard way. This is lacking at this moment, maybe due 
to business point of view also, that is why users has to go to visit various 
websites. Advantage of Agent system is that here only related data is 
transfered through web which is only 30% compared to displaying whole page of 
the websites (where 70% of content is transfered to browser just as static 
information i.e HTML etc. about how to display that page).

Another example is of email clients. Email system has standardization about 
sending and receiving mails that is why Email clients could be developed and 
can be kept at client side.

But since users are not still Data centric, building such Agent applications 
for rest of web services will be difficult. Because people don't know what is 
best for them. So they would like animated Submit button more than 
traditional gray-black buttons. If other website provides more attractive 
stuff then people will go there. This thing hampers integration and  
co-ordination of web componenets. Another problem is that Web is not in hands 
of single governing body, that is why changes suggested takes lot of time to 
come into real implementation (however they are implemented but slowly).

I might not be exactly answering your query, but this is how I see Web2 from 
user point of view. I want to write lot of things about this topic but due to 
time limitations, can't write much. But this was nice topic for discussion.

Thanks

Odd, I have seen examples in well-known and respected books that said
things like

class User
{

  function __construct($userId=null) {

    if ($userId) {
	// load data from db and
	// throw Exception if not found

    } else {
	// expect an insert
    }

  }
}

Quite good, thanks. Now, a question about
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2004/08/05/dataobjects.html?page=3

What if you want to find a record WHERE $object->someProp LIKE 'M%' (as
opposed to " = ")?

The first crude thing that comes to mind is, if you want LIKE, say

$user = 'Jane%'

and have your find() method look for '%' and do LIKE if it's found.

Thoughts?

Hello all,

I have a textarea field that can .. store text.

I'm using it to save emails for example w/a form.
I grab the posted data and call addslashes( ) then stick it into the 
database, varchar(1024). (this is a calendar app for my own use).

Now, when I pull it out, its not formatted and displaying it on the screen 
is just one long line.

How can I keep newlines/r and formatting from the text that is input into 
the textarea box?

Thanks.

- Ben

Use the nl2br() function when displaying the data.

Well, if you are talking about displaying in HTML then you should replace
\n\r with a <br>

This is where DataObjects can start to grow in complexity. What  
you're doing here is creating a wrapper for your database, so that  
each table maps to an class, and has a nice, clean interface. But how  
do you keep your interface clean and still have access to the fancy  
functionality of your database?

A simple solution to your example below: you might at an argument to  
your find() method.

function find ($useLike = true) {
	...
}

But you'll quickly come across more complex scenarios, and you will  
either end up with too many methods or too many arguments for your  
methods... I've heard Object Relational Mapping described as the  
"Vietnam" of software development.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Relational_Mapping

A more flexible solution is to have a query() method that allows you  
to supply your own custom SQL. While this removes some of the  
abstraction, it does give you lots of flexibility. And besides,  
sometimes it is important to write your own optimized SQL for a  
particular query. Here's an example:

$user = new DataObject('user');
$user->query('SELECT * FROM user WHERE name LIKE '%john%' AND age <  
35');

The other possibility is to look into existing DataObject frameworks  
that have already implemented the fancy stuff for you. I've used  
PEAR's DB_DataObject. It's a bit of a pain to get up an running, but  
it's solid. There are quite a few others -- here are a few:

http://pear.php.net/package/DB_DataObject/
http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/
and CakePHP implements its own ActiveRecord  http://cakephp.org/

Thoughts? My though is that "one offs" is where all the fancy schmancy
models start to fall apart... I just outsourced a big project to a firm
that had a nice MVC framework. My how clean the code was. My how short
all the scripts were. Until I opened a few "catch-all" files that went
on forever dealing with the "one-offs"

Is there an equivalent to call_user_func equivalent in Javascript? I'd
rather not use eval for security purposes.

Felix, 

Sure, that is helpful, but what about tabs, lists and all the other elements that could exist in an email message.
I'm looking for a canned function or class that will do the work.

Thanks.

....some code.....
$details   = str_replace("\n\r", "<br>", $cellSet[0]['info']);

Just as a side note, the Object->query function is pretty much exactly

I was gonna say -- but didn't, for brevity's sake -- that I have spent
several+ hours with Cake, and it does seem mighty cool, yet I've run into
enough snags to wonder about the name. Like findAll() not fetching the
data that I need and having to write custom SQL anyway.

Then I looked at DB_DataObject and quickly noticed the pain part that you
refer to. I realize I don't quite get it and that's surely part of my
problem, but still I think the docs and examples on
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db-dataobject.php are kind
of abstruse.

I might end up coming full circle and hand-coding a lot of stuff. I recall
the words of one great sage on this list:

"SQL is a language. Love it."

Fellow PHP'ers;

As a developer, most times for a professional site the graphical 
components might be conveniently delivered by the design person.  This 
makes for very easy reference and literally plug-in.

However, like today, there is often the occasion where someone desires a 
change in some of the text that is already part of an image.   The 
technique I usually use is to make a copy of the image then use gimp to 
cut-out the undesired portion then add the new text to the image and 
move it around finally flattening it, saving it then uploading to the 
site.  Most times it works reasonably well (sort of!)

But, the clarity and precision of these resulting images are certainly 
not up to the quality that the original displayed.  I don't know the 
real reason because I'm not a graphics designer/artist.  It appears that 
the fonts, even though anti-aliased, are not as sharp as the original.

So, what other techniques do most of you use to accomplish the same? 
Surely not everyone has an in-house graphics artist.  I know I never 
had.  What programs and/or techniques are customarily used to accomplish 
this feat?

While this is not entirely a php question, it certainly is php developer 
related so that's why I though of posting to this list.

Thank you all.

In some cases (depending on the complexity of the "images") you could
get away with just using a rich HTML editor like FckEditor
(http://www.fckeditor.net/) which would give them a WYSIWYG type and
feel over a given section.  You would give a cell a given background
template image and let them work around.  This of course does not give
you the Photoshop layering capabilities to a precise layout but like I
said depending on the complexity will leave them "happy enough" :-)

Also that editor supports upload + file browsing which is pretty nice.

One thing you might want to keep in mind is that the original file might 
have been done in Photoshop. If you replace the text with Gimp, the text 
may look a little different because each program has different ways of 
handling anti-aliasing.

In my experience, that sort of problem is best answered by keeping the 
original layered (PSD or Gimp equivalent) files on hand somewhere. That 
makes it infinitely easier (and less time consuming) to modify the image 
at a later date.

Ah, hate to be a killjoy, but does that mean you just echo that field
back to the screen? Big security hole. The tricky part is how to escape
the output while still allowing the special characters that you want.

JOINs are a bear with the DataObject pattern. I basically never use  
the DB_DataObject::join() method. If I need a join, I just use the  
query() method instead. I think the documentation even recommends  
this for all but the simplest JOIN queries.

DB_DataObject was actually my first introduction to DataObjects  
(trial by fire!), and after using it for a while I really enjoy the  
simplicity of Darryl Patterson's article. Why not take a lightweight  
framework like he has described and just extend it as needed on a  
case-by-case basis?

Another "Ask the NYC PHP Crowd" question...

I've been given the responsibility of developing a policy for a small
(and growing) team of developers. By "policy" I mean defining how
"development" code becomes "live" code. The point is to minimize
problems in the program itself and the database behind it.

How do you balance flexibility with minimizing risk? I've talked to a
few of my fellow developers, and a few of them have talked about the
usefulness of code review. That seems to be good idea, as does
allowing only or two people to place development code on the live side
(less cooks in the kitchen).

Any suggestions on stuff I should think about?

Maybe the next big advance is not going to be in software, but in the pipe. 

A simple elegant cheaply manufactured ubiquitous massive wireless pipe 
(even faster, wider than fiber optic to the desktop) that will be always on 
the grid computing cloud network and handle anything. 

Simultaneously moving multiple DVD-quality streams, thousands of
personal/family bots, 
dozens of local desktop and/or network/internet applications blind to any
language or framework 
regardless of how bloated, intricate or overloaded with dependencies.

It is highly doubtful (and possibly not even desirable) that all the
disparate 
software standards, languages, applications, and techniques will be 100%
standardized 
and 100% interface abele. 

More likely I think in the future, more and more, entities like the
government, defense, 
banks, medical, brokers (likely, even wealthy individuals) will require --
absolutely must have -- 
their software written in a completely custom, highly-non-interfacing, 
enigmatic, highly-obscured language not in use anywhere else in the world.

I believe, in fact, that the US gov and defense already do write custom
software/apps 
with no known commercial equivilancy.

It is more likely that software will continue to branch and customize and
specialize moving 
more towards an infinite complexity handled by quantum and organic
processors allowing 
every person to get their own idiosyncratic signature language set of
instructions 
for their individual personal data storage and retreival all saved on a
single well-worn 
Life-ling multi-terabyte universal smart ID card that can maintain state
indefinately and 
only interfaces with the network when activated and plugged in or wiped.

Very true. People use web just as a part of fulfilling their requirements. 
That is why they don't pay much attention towards how they are being served.

As soon as their purposes are fulfilled, they stop using web and continue 
doing other stuffs. Since they are not much aware of technologies on which 
web applications have been built and running, we can't rely much on their  
opinion to bring changes. Hence it is mostly our efforts to make any changes

that we think it needs to bring.

I think code reviews are great, they give people a change to highlight well 
done code and
point out errors and common pitfalls.

Plus people can't sneak kludges in as easily.

Having a document that states comment style, code style etc can help as 
well.
At my previous job it was required all new highers read the doc.
Having code reviews made sure the guidelines laid out in the doc where 
followed.

As you stated, speaking to the other developers to find out what the 
standards will be is the best idea,
they hopefully you can avoid disagreements with what style will be 
used..since those involved will be
able to voice their opinions.

Less cooks is better, unless it means people are waiting to check stuff in 
on live.
If they have a development server that mimics live then its not really a 
problem,
they can test and feel pretty condfident about their code before they check 
it in.

If you dont have a development server that mimics the live server, I would 
get one ASAP.

good luck!

In this vein, determine a standard syntax for variable naming.

IE, $this_variable versus $thisVariable.

Less confusing that way.

Hi,

    you can't display tab in HTML and the textarea box takes just plain 
ASCII. So any fancy spacing, indenting or such will either be stripped 
or shown as single spaces. And HTML also cannot display an arry of 
simple white space. You would need to convert that to non-breaking 
spaces. But isn't there a function that translates all kinds of things 
to the equivalent HTML code?

Hi,

    so you want to create high quality software. That is not only a task 
of developing. You want to address quality issues way before writing or 
even testing code. That would be during the design phase. Does the 
application design specify explicitly things such as input checking 
(what to check and what is to be considered OK), user interface design, 
modularization as much as possible, and things like that. Also, you want 
to tell your developers that any code passed on to QA has to be tested 
against a good set of test cases by the developer. Claiming that it 
compiles is not sufficient. Also, you want to come up with some coding 
convention and demand fully commented source code (which means comments 
for each line that have a code word or an operation in them). Also, see 
that you ideally get a tester to developer ratio of 1:1, not 1:20 as it 
is common in most places. I think 1:3 is reasonable (one tester for 
three developers). Include the testers, the developers, support, and 
customers in the design decisions. None of your developers will use the 
software on a regular basis, your customers will, so they have to say 
what flies and what not.

 From my experience, when the developer isn't absolutely and entirely 
sure that the code delivered is good code, there is no reason to make a 
tester suffer. And listen to the people at the front line, mainly 
support and the customers themselves. Uh, and get developers who know 
the industry and not just the latest tricks in coding. You can get to 
that by giving the developers plenty of training. And, put the 
developers into the support department for at least one day each month. 
Nothing straightens out a developer more than a bitching customer. Most 
developers need to experience the pain first hand to be convinced that 
their code is crap.

Besides that, you can read my MS thesis about just this topic. ;)

I have a function that does what I want, I just find it hard to
believe that there isn't something better. So any pointers would be
greatly appreciated.

function convertDatetime($value){
	$value=explode(" ", $value);
	$value=explode("-", $value[0]);
	$y=$value[0];
	$m=$value[1];
	$d=$value[2];
	switch($m){

linux/unix only I think:

function convertDatetime($value){
  return date( 'F d, Y', strtotime( $value ) );
}

You can also now do it directly in MySQL ... might be available as  
UDF on older versions.

mysql> select monthname('2006-10-19') as month;
+---------+
| month   |
+---------+
| October |
+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

I feel your pain, but I have to either be able to get it done myself or 
have a really good relationship with an always-online and willing PS expert.

It's really a client problem, so having a friend anxious to quote 
on-demand work is probably the best way to go. Why should it be "free"?

I'd like to read it as well. Thanks for offering.

I think that a code review stage is great if done right, because it can 
create a quality expectation that basically reminds people to "fix it or 
it will never pass code review". On the flip side, it's a significant 
management program and you have to expect it to take time if itis 
expected to be worthwhile.

One of those things... "why do we have that cop on the corner? He just 
stands there all day long doing nothing...."

We have put up a demo app that demonstrates Andromeda.  The URL is:

http://dhost2.secdat.com/demo_peds

The username and password are both "guest".  Please feel free to look 
around.  Feel free to make any changes you want to, beat it up, etc.

This guest user is actually an "admin" user, so you have full powers in 
the app, short of creating new users.

We will be looking at the code used to produce this app at the 
presentation on Tuesday.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Successor to the Web?
In-Reply-To: <001f01c6f2bd$f4d81360$6701a8c0@SUNCODE1>
Message-ID: <20061020171610.01A4EA88AA@virtu.nyphp.org>

I would like to express my appreciation to those in the NYPHP community (I
counted 13 responses) who responded to my question about a potential
successor to the Web.  It will take me a while to analyze these responses,
but the picture that was communicated was already useful to me.

 

I found the references provided by Dan Krook particularly useful for my
purposes:

 

Ajax and REST, Part 1: Advantages of the Ajax/REST architectural style for
immersive Web applications
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-ajaxarch/

 

Some more information about REST principles:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer

 

 

My goal was to check my development direction, to be sure that I had not
become too attached to my current set of development tools only to find that
serious successors were already emerging and the work I was doing would soon
become obsolete.  My impression at this point is that my general direction
is reasonable, but requires some modification.

 

I should have described the application characteristics in more detail.
They must run over the Internet or a public equivalent.  They must blend
content management with data management.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons
that I seem to be encountering force-fits because as at least one
contributor to this discussion pointed out, the Web is stateless by design
intent.

 

If I have encountered some difficulties in dealing with statelessness for
the applications I am developing, it is not because of any difficulties I am
encountering in PHP.  I am impressed with PHP, but it is not the whole
picture.

 

Again, many thanks for the contributions that were made to this discussion.
They have saved me a great deal of research effort.

 

Phil Duffy

Please don't hate me, Ken, but your sample application is vulnerable
to cross-site scripting attacks. It seems you're not properly escaping
values in forms?

Or at least, not in this form:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Unsetting array elements
Message-ID: <453920DF.4070903@email.smith.edu>

Hi,

I'd like to cycle through an array and destroy some elements (and leave 
some intact).  What's the "best" way to do that?

Here's what I put together so far (which shows my array ignorance)  =)

<?

$test=array("auth" => "yes" , "name" => "joe" , "sort" => "ascending")

while (list ($k, $v) = each ($test))
	{
		if ($k == "auth") {}
		else { unset($k[$v]); }
	}

?>

That produces an error because of the unset($k[$v]; line.

Thanks!

-Aaron

You need to unset the index in the test array not in the $k array, so 
the unset line should look like:
                 else  unset($test[$k]);

I fixed that line and it's working now:

else { unset($test[$k]); }

However I would be interested to hear if anyone thinks there is a better 
or more efficient approach to how I am doing it.

Cheers,

As an open-source developer, I'm always happy when somebody reviews and 
comments :)

You are right.  We do "escape when sending", and the htmlentities() call 
was missing from the library routine.

Thanks, good catch, it is fixed now.

Good to know. That's one of the big advantages of using a framework,
fix the code in one place and the entire app is secured.

Otherwise it might have been a long weekend, putting all those
htmlentities() calls in, eh?

See you Tuesday.

+1

Also just forcing a download using html tables and content-type 
application/excel can work with excel and openoffice-calc. The <td>'s 
are the columns.  This is not as full featured and robust as the PEAR 
package, but does seem to work for simple, single sheet spreadsheets. 
And it's fast to code if you already have the html tables ready (:

I have studying thread-safety issue with PHP and Apache2.  I know PHP does
not have a thread model (like Java). I cannot seem to find real
document/code
that clearly explains the problem. I am looking at building tool that will
scan PHP code and tell me whether it is thread-safe or not. Would anyone be
interested in such a tool ;-)

yipes!  Has anyone played with this yet? Can I hook it into mySQL?

"OpenLaszlo is an open source platform for creating zero-install web
applications with the user interface capabilities of desktop client
software.

OpenLaszlo programs are written in XML and JavaScript and
transparently compiled to Flash and soon DHTML. The OpenLaszlo APIs
provide animation, layout, data binding, server communication, and
declarative UI. An OpenLaszlo application can be as short as a single
source file, or factored into multiple files that define reusable
classes and libraries.

OpenLaszlo is write once run everywhere. An OpenLaszlo application
developed on one machine will run on all leading Web browsers on all
leading desktop operating systems."

FYI - if you're near Boston next Tuesday or Wednesday the AJAX Experience
(and OpenLaszlo) is showing.  Alternatively, BostonPHP is hosting an AJAX
presentation 10/25 @ 6:30 where Max Carlson (Co-Founder OpenLaszlo.org) will
provide and update on his 2/06 presentation:

The Road to AJAX - In the past, OpenLaszlo been regarded as a Flash-only
tool. In fact, OpenLaszlo is a powerful language for rich, custom
declarative user interface programming that's been under development for
over 5 years. It's a powerful framework, and it has an exciting future as a
single (OpenSource) language that can target Flash, DHTML and soon,other
runtimes. 

In this talk Max will talk about the process of making OpenLaszlo a
runtime-independent platform, including the first year of AJAX. He will give
an overview of the current multi-runtime architecture, including techniques
for using and extending it. See an overview of the language, and talk about
the future of OpenLaszlo as an AJAX platform.

All BostonPHP events are free as in "beer" and open [to all] as in "source".

out of personal curiosity,
why aren't they using their own dev tool for their own front end? 
http://www.openlaszlo.org/
If for flash it's great then that's awesome by itself, but what 
applications has it been used in?
the demos are pretty awesome, but all seem to revolve around flash.

has anyone actually used it that's on this list? what's your dev 
timeline been with OpenLaszlo vs other frameworks?
I really like the concepts behind OpenLaszlo and would like to chat with 
a few people who've used it.

Hi,

Others on this list can perhaps provide more detail, but here's a run
down...

PHP cannot do threading itself - it can only fork().  However, PHP's core
itself can be compiled to run in a threaded environment (for instance under
Apache 2's various MPMs).  So PHP itself isn't creating threads - Apache is
handling user requests in a threaded manner, which in turn makes PHP run in
a threaded way.

The problem really is not thread safe code written in the PHP language, but
rather the environment in which PHP runs in.  Now PHP can be compiled for
thread safety (TSRM, for instance http://us2.php.net/tsrm).  However,
because PHP is often linked against so many external libraries
(gd/jpeg/xml/etc) it cannot be considered safe to execute in a threaded
environment.  This is the real problem and one of PHP's greatest strengths
and unfortunate faults.

So, writing an application that scans PHP code for thread safety wouldn't be
useful.  However, writing an application that would scan the C code of the
libraries used in PHP's extensions, would be of great value - then we could
determine which PHP configuration combinations are thread safe, and which
are not.  For instance, I had once run PHP only with the MySQL and Oracle
extensions compiled, under Apache 2 with threading - it was stable for
years.  Rasmus had once started to document which libraries were thread safe
and which were not, but I think it hasn't been actively maintained.

Hopefully this somewhat clarifies a confusing issue.

Dan,

Please see my brother's response (principal on the Openlaszlo team) below.

Mark

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks.  My 2 cents below.  Feel free to forward back to your list  
(which I am not on).

Openlaszlo is for creating web apps, not web sites.  The clock on the  
home page is an openlaszlo app embedded in an html page.  The  
openlaszlo site is just using appropriate (open source) technology  
for the task at hand.

If you want to see a site with larger openlaszlo applications, you  
should visit the [commercial website](http://www.laszlosystems.com/)  
to see some of the customers that are using the technology and their  
applications.  To see a full 'web 2.0'-style application running in  
openlaszlo, sign up for a free [LaszloMail](http://www.laszlomail.com/ 
lzmail/) account and try it out.

The current runtime is the SWF player, yes, but there is no Flash in  
the demos, they are all built from straight Openlaszlo.  Openlaszlo's  
strength is to build rich web clients, which can be backed by any xml  
content management system, such as php+sql.

If you go to the [demos](http://www.openlaszlo.org/demos), you can  
see previews of several of the demos that run _either_ in Flash or  
DHTML.  Look for the links that say 'Launch Flash Application' and  
'Launch DHTML Application'.  This is the same source code, compiled  
to run either on the Flash player or in browser DHTML.  (You can   
tell the difference by right-clicking over the app -- you will see  
either the Flash player menu or the browser menu.)

Try the [introduction](http://tinyurl.com/ympnpx).  Join the [mailing  
list](mailto:laszlo-user-request at openlaszlo.org).

One last thing:  The article on xml.com by Pillai is a great article,  
but it focuses on using the Eclipse-based IDE for laszlo, which is  
not _required_ to develop openlaszlo.  You can develop openlaszlo  
with any text editor (an xml-aware one is useful), the download from  
the openlaszlo site, and your favorite web browser.  It is very easy  
to just edit your openlaszlo source, save it out, and reload the page  
in your browser to see how it works.

    This is also a problem for Perl,  Python and many other languages 
which are advertised as thread-safe.  Java runtimes are threadsafe 
because of a general xenophobia:  the Java runtimes link in a limited 
number of C libraries,  and Java programmers don't really believe in 
linking in C libraries...  Though I have to admit that I've had good 
luck linking Java to Fortran.

    Lacking threads,  the big disadvantage of PHP is that it consumes 
more memory.  Data structures need to be replicated for each copy of 
PHP.  That said,  RAM is getting cheaper,  and PHP is parsimonious in 
it's memory use,  so most of us do just fine running PHP in processes 
instead of threads.

Is serializing/unserializing object/arrays for storage/retrieval in a

Thanks for the explanation...This definitely clarifies many things to me.
Now supposing PHP 7 or greater decides to become multithreading (as Java)
What do you think will be the main issues in the legacy PHP3 to PHP6 with
respect to multithreading ;-)

With regards,

Others on this list can perhaps provide more detail, but here's a run
down...

PHP cannot do threading itself - it can only fork().  However, PHP's core
itself can be compiled to run in a threaded environment (for instance under
Apache 2's various MPMs).  So PHP itself isn't creating threads - Apache is
handling user requests in a threaded manner, which in turn makes PHP run in
a threaded way.

The problem really is not thread safe code written in the PHP language, but
rather the environment in which PHP runs in.  Now PHP can be compiled for
thread safety (TSRM, for instance http://us2.php.net/tsrm).  However,
because PHP is often linked against so many external libraries
(gd/jpeg/xml/etc) it cannot be considered safe to execute in a threaded
environment.  This is the real problem and one of PHP's greatest strengths
and unfortunate faults.

So, writing an application that scans PHP code for thread safety wouldn't
be
useful.  However, writing an application that would scan the C code of the
libraries used in PHP's extensions, would be of great value - then we could
determine which PHP configuration combinations are thread safe, and which
are not.  For instance, I had once run PHP only with the MySQL and Oracle
extensions compiled, under Apache 2 with threading - it was stable for
years.  Rasmus had once started to document which libraries were thread
safe
and which were not, but I think it hasn't been actively maintained.

Hopefully this somewhat clarifies a confusing issue.

Thanks for the nice explanation... Would PHP ever become multithreaded...
Since Apache 2+ will continue to course of multithreading I am
sure PHP will eventually have to catch up the multithreading direction...

    This is also a problem for Perl,  Python and many other languages
which are advertised as thread-safe.  Java runtimes are threadsafe
because of a general xenophobia:  the Java runtimes link in a limited
number of C libraries,  and Java programmers don't really believe in
linking in C libraries...  Though I have to admit that I've had good
luck linking Java to Fortran.

    Lacking threads,  the big disadvantage of PHP is that it consumes
more memory.  Data structures need to be replicated for each copy of
PHP.  That said,  RAM is getting cheaper,  and PHP is parsimonious in
it's memory use,  so most of us do just fine running PHP in processes
instead of threads.

Agreed; Java is threaded, from the ground up for the most part.

This I disagree with.  One of the primary reasons Java is built to be
threaded from the ground up is that it has to be.  I couldn't imagine having
a separate process instance of Java for every request - there isn't a server
on the planet with that much RAM - whereas PHP/Apache can happily live in
15-25mb of RAM or less.  Long story short, PHP is fair lighter than Java,
threads or no threads.

But there are certainly other advantages of threads, and I do hope that in
the near future core PHP configurations can begin to take advantage of them.
While creating threads in PHP isn't as important in my opinion for the
typical web application, being able to run in a thread-aware environment,
could be.

Unfortunately, this is a chicken and egg problem, since no one wants to put
the development time in until they see some justification... oh wait, I
covered this once already:

I would frankly recommend against it.  While it's possible if you're
careful, there can be a lot of surprises, such as:

-- unserialized objects aren't quite what you may expect them to be (ie, the
definition of the class either has changed or doesn't exist)

-- it's slow

-- it doesn't give you any type of normalization - ie, the object's data is
relationally useless - and you end up having to do text matching to find
anything

There are some other options, that may be better:

http://us3.php.net/wddx

Although it has it's downfalls too.  End of the day, I'd try to avoid
serializing objects - serializing arrays and scalar types, though not
optimized in PHP (ie, slow), is much more reliable.

    In the limit of low load and small memory consumption per process,  
you're right.  Java often takes 50 MB to just get started.  Under the 
real-world circumstances of most developers,  PHP is remarkably 
efficient.  In most cases,  my understanding is that PHP burns up about 
2 M per process -- it takes 25 of those to equal an idle Java process,  
and you can still fit 1000 processes in 2 GB,  a typical amount of 
memory for a small server.

    When considering details,  it gets more complicated.  It's not just 
a matter of the cost of the runtime system,  but also the cost of memory 
that your application uses.  In a language like Java,  you can create a 
really big data structure,  say,  200 MB in RAM;  you might load it out 
of a file when your application starts.  Thousands of threads can share 
that data structure,  getting excellent performance with low memory 
consumption.  This is one way Java can win for large systems.

    Java has it's own problems that surface in large systems.  Java uses 
16-bit characters internally,  which is a bad choice.  Java puffs up 
English text by a factor of two,  but can't handle Chinese text 
correctly.  In my book,  Lucene is a toy.  When I'm handling 5 GB of 
text,  I dont need to have my storage requirements doubled.

I do this to allow for an extendable data model. Aside from the usual
indexed fields (title, created, author) content tables also get a php
field, that stores a serialized standard object. When the record is
loaded, the php field is converted into a property on the object:
$object->local. So developers can write business logic that sets
$object->local->color, and that will persist and be available every
time the object is loaded.

As Hans points out, you have to be careful, and it isn't particularly
portable, but it has benefits in the areas of rapid prototyping and
systems that can adapt to changing needs.

Using standard objects is a good idea.

No doubt.

Yep. And you end up writing a function to generate a carefully crafted
LIKE statement to match key=value:

  function phplike( $key, $value ) {
    $like = '%"'.$this->esc($key).'";s:'.strlen($value).':"'.$this->esc($value).'"%';
    return $like;
  }

There is an understanding that local properties aren't going to be
indexed by the database, so aren't really useful in queries. The brute
force method encoded above is only for situations where you _really_
need to lookup objects by local property.

Not for the feint of heart, but also very useful.

Because you are asking PHP to evaluate the quoted string.  What you want 
to do is:

eval("echo $calc_str;");

BUT, you are hereby warned that eval() is generaly a very bad idea for 
security reasons.

We are using MySQL5 to store serialized and compressed(gzip) page state 
data for the PRADO framework. After some magic with tables and 
application configuration, everything is working smooth and 
fast(knocking on the wood :)

Before, we were saving uncompressed serialized objects, size of which 
were reaching 100kb. We've faced no major problems with that, except 
for(of course) performance issue...

Depends on what you're doing.  We use them to store history.  For example, 
our update method finds the diff between the old and new data.  The diff 
contains the old values that are about to be changed, in an associative 
array format with column names as the keys.  We then serialize that and 
store it in a history table along with the record id and table name.

This is a pretty common use of serialized data, and one it is fairly
well suited to.

That said, I tend to use a simple xml format for storing these kinds of
fields, for a few reasons.

1. UTF-8 encoding is easy in XML
2. XML is easy to read/edit manually if needed
3. It's harder to break and when you do, easier to fix

I suppose somebody should chime in and point out that you can also store 
the historical data in POTS (plain old tables), on the theory that 
tabular information works best in tables.  Easier to write, easier to read.

I'm at pains to ask at this point if we should question some of the 
basic assumptions of the MVC model.

Underneath MVC is usually an ORM philosophy, whether it is stated or 
implied.  The ORM philosophy tries to cast tables into OO terms, and 
IMHO this is why the approach tends to produce at least as much work as 
it eliminates.

In fact, the data tables are fully encapsulated by the database server 
and do not need to be encapsulated further into classes.  Doing so 
introduces obfuscations which then must be un-obfuscated, so author ends 
up doing work to do accomplish an unnecessary goal, which then requires 
further work to undo. 

By contrast, a generalized query-by-form is far easier to write by 
approaching it as a simple function that need only know a table name, 
and the column types and widths.  It does the same thing for every table 
otherwise.  You can put it into a class if you like, but it works just 
as well as a library routine.

As an example of this, check out one of the apps we will be demoing at 
Tuesday's Andromeda presentation:

http://dhost2.secdat.com/demo_peds

Username and password are both "guest".

Look at the menu on the left, skip the first two entries 
"ProcedureDiagnosis X Ref" and "Claims" and look at the next few 
entries, "Procedure Codes", "Prodedure Groups" and so forth.  Each of 
these tables is pure zero-code, not even a three-line class declaration 
went into any of them.

Other more interesting tables are much lower on the menu, particularly 
"Carriers", which contains real data, and "Families".  We're loading 
fake data to the "Families" and "Family Members" also.

I am trying to create a file that will print a web page

  form=|http://maggie.sdcwa.org/eng/project/view_project.phtml|

The problem is that if I use the code below to read the file then
$lines is empty.
  $lines = file("$from");

If I use the code below, $lines contains the file:
  $lines = file('

I do not know why it will read the file when I spell the actual URL compare
compare to when I read the URL using the $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'].

For tonight's demo of Andromeda, we will have a wireless router and you 
will be able to connect into the demo apps if you have a wireless adapter.

One of our demos, a time tracker, works much better if you have a login 
account.  If you want to get an account just email the list with a 
desired userid before 3:30pm and we'll have the account created when the 
show begins. 
Or you can get to the show early, and we will be creating accounts from 
6:15pm - 6:30pm.

Also, we will be demonstrating *very* limited smartphone stuff if time 
permits.  If you have a wi-fi enabled smartphone bring that along too 
and you can see a thing or two.

To be honest, I've really just fallen into an MVC approach as I've  
learned, so I can't really compare it to anything other than the  
chaotic php/sql/html I used to write when I got started. I suppose I  
agree that ORM and MVC may not save time in the short-term, but I've  
found it can have a huge impact on the maintainability of my code. It  
does not mean I write less code -- it just gives me structured  
buckets to put it in. I also find the code becomes very expressive  
with MVC and ORM. I can glance at it 6 months later and know exactly  
what I was trying to do.

This is interesting. I've thought about this before, but haven't  
heard anyone else express it. But a table is just data, no? I've  
found it useful to wrap tables in classes so that I can attach  
business logic to them.

I can't quite visualize it. I'm looking forward to seeing some  
examples at your presentation this evening. I'm always look for a  
better way...

A table is, at minimum, data.  But the table is also the most natural 
home of biz logic.  You can attach triggers (server-side programs) that 
automatically fire on the three actions of insert, update, delete, and 
these triggers can contain all of your business logic.

Consider this: code attached to the table is as simple as the world can 
get.  Any other situation, such as putting the code out in the web 
layer, is a *complication*, and will always have drawbacks.  The first 
is of course that your database is now helpless to defend itself against 
rogue apps.  This is very important because the better the businessman 
you are, the more likely your software will be deployed by an IT 
department that demands access to the database.  The second big problem 
is the ORM classes will always be more complex than the triggers they 
are by definition oxy-moronic: code that is by definition always 
attached to a specific table, yet by no possible mechanism can be 
positively synchronized with that table.   Thirdly of course is 
performance, since application code is farther away from the server than 
trigger code, many functions will be forever doomed to be slower.

Now, if you are on mySQL, some or much of this may not be possible.  
This explains why people will say that mySQL, despite ongoing 
improvements, is not a "real" database.

So why don't people do it this way?  Several reasons.  First, they 
simply don't know they can.  There is a second reason that is more 
justifiable, which is that it turns out to be a royal PITA to diddle 
around with triggers the way we do so effortlessly with our piles of PHP 
files.  Another reason, which is harder to get into in an email, is an 
inclination to remain "platform independent" by avoiding coding in the 
proprietary language of a server product.   Coders don't want their biz 
logic "locked" into Oracle syntax, or Postgres syntax, and so forth.

The Andromeda solution is to store the database spec in a plaintext file 
and to generate the table definitions and triggers.  This gives the 
Andromeda programmer:

-> Simple editing of biz rules in a text file
-> Platform independence, as we can generate SQL for multiple back-ends 
(this is only true in principle, we target only PostgreSQL at this time)
-> All biz logic in the web server, its natural home
-> All kinds of whiz-bang install/upgrade stuff
-> Huge reduction in coding

Hope this helps, and looking forward to seeing you this evening!

Kenneth,

Perhaps you can generate a neutral version? HTML or PDF?

Message-ID: <a304e2d60610241639mf9e07d0h694e1a4f83b474d4@mail.gmail.com>

HI people,

I am trying to read a file using "file" and I am passing the following
string
for the input file parameter:
http://maggie.sdcwa.org/eng/list/client_find_project_list.phtml?proj_name=CATHODICPROTECTION
OF RAMONA PIPELINE PHASE 2&show=1

phpinfo shows:
_GET["proj_name"] CATHODIC
_SERVER["SERVER_PROTOCOL"] PROTECTION OF RAMONA PIPELINE PHASE 2&show=1
HTTP/1.0
Somehow the variables data being passed as an argument are split.

Anyone ran into this before?

thanks,

N?stor :-)

First, let me say this is a VERY VERY VERY bad idea for security 
reasons.  Never use user input for stuff like that.

Second, from the typos you have above, it is clear your example shown 
here is produced by typing rather than not copying and pasting.  So we 
can't diagnose what's really happening.

Third, putting the quotes around $from in that last line is not 
necessary.

Fourth, it seems like it's actually working because the call to file() 
is not throwing an error, right?  [Or are you going to pull one of 
those "Oh, yeah, I forgot to say, the Check Engine light is on" 
situations that happened on "Car Talk" a few weeks ago?]  Thus if 
$lines is empty, the file is empty.

No, you shouldn't use the htmlentities() function, since that will 
not encode spaces. You should use the urlencode() function, since that will.

Daniel thanks for your help.

I can tell you that this is not user input but I was printing
variable to try to debug the problem.

I do not know what typos you are referring to since those lines
of code worked, can you tell me what typos you are talking about.

Putting the quotes around the $form is not necessary but is not ilegal.

The problem I found in calling the "FIle($file)".  $file will include a file
to
check for session information and it will send the page to a login page.
I found the problem as soon as I went home when I was thinking about it
while eating dinner (ha, ha,..)

Thanks for your help,

N?stor :-)

Michael + Ken

Using urlencode did the trick.  I was surprise that $_GET will urldecode
the variables automatically.

Thanks!!!!

HTTP_REFERER is considered user input, becuase it is built from HTTP
headers. Just make sure you implicitly trust anybody who is able to
execute the script. One could send a referrer that looks like
"file:///etc/passwd" or something.

There's no reason that $lines = file( $from ) wouldn't work, provided
$from is actually set. So either this is a PHP bug, which is
_extremely_ unlikely, or you have a typo somewhere in your code. Are
you sure you didn't set $form? Are you sure that the referrer is being
sent? Are you checking for an error raised by the file() call?

Hey Chris:

Just wondering about this...what kind of filter would you recommend  
passing over the HTTP_REFERER in order to verify it's (reasonably)  
kosher?

Cheers,

At minimum you'd want to make sure the referrer starts with "http://"
or "https://", which will cut off local filesystem access. Include
ftp:// if you need to, but who passes ftp urls in the referrer?

If your server can potentially access other systems inside a firewall,
it would be a darn good idea to write some sort of host-based
blacklist, with localhost included. Being comprehensive could be
difficult, maybe just better to disallow LAN access to any server that
runs this kind of code.

Of course, if the value is output into markup, you want to convert it
using htmlentities().

Anyone think of anything else?

When I'm faced with using an eval, I usually stop and ask myself "How
did I end up in this situation?".  The answer tends to be that I made
a mistake or assumption earlier on that now has forced me into needing
an eval to continue.

I don't think eval is bad, but rather, it is a glaring reminder of the
mistake I made previously.  Nonetheless, it is there, and there may be
valid reasons for using it depending on your situation.

Hi, Kenneth:

I didn't make it last night. I reviewed your slides. It's very interesting. Could you give me a username/password to access the online demo.

I'm chemist working for a small manufacturer in upstate. I also write software for my company using PHP and mySQL. I believe your system has very good application small business environment.

I wish could attend your future presentation.

Regards,


Chunlin Wang, Ph.D.

 Thanks in advance for any advise.
  I have forgotten to RSVP at least once myself, I showed photo ID and they let me in.

Didn't say it was.  It's just wasteful.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Native MySQL driver in PHP6
Message-ID: <E5EDDAC6-C8B0-477D-B080-D7FF1D34E60A@jonbaer.com>

Ahh more of the "if its not broke fix it anyway to add more  
confusion" PHP :-)

Well Im sure the licensing thing is one item left to be resolved but  
these are 2 nice improvements ...

http://www.planetmysql.org/kaj/?p=69

     *   we intend to add support for client-side query caching in  
the PHP driver for MySQL, probably already to MySQL 5.1 Community Server
     * we intend to add support for a Prepared Statements cache to  
the PHP driver for MySQL, also implemented on the MySQL Server

Is that a memory-based cache being discussed or file-based?  Has  
anyone tried the memcache/MySQL engine?

- Jon

Hello Chunlin,

You can use the username "jones" and password "jones" for the demo at 
this site:

dhost2.secdat.com/demo_time

You can also look at the medical billing program if you like, it has 
quite a bit more going on, the username and password are both "guest" 
and it is here:

dhost2.secdat.com/demo_peds

Don't hesitate to email me if you have any questions about the system.

I had a similar issue and this is the solution i came up with. I have often
wondered if this is the right way of doing it or not, but I'm by far not a
PHP guru, just learning.

before inserting into the database I encode the data using the
htmlspecialchars() function.

$encReq = htmlspecialchars($req, ENT_QUOTES);

when I'm displaying it back to the user i had to use the following function
to convert it back into HTML.

function unhtmlspecialchars( $string )
{
    $string = str_replace ( '&amp;', '&', $string );
    $string = str_replace ( '&#039;', '\'', $string );
    $string = str_replace ( '&quot;', '"', $string );
    $string = str_replace ( '&lt;', '<', $string );
    $string = str_replace ( '&gt;', '>', $string );

    return $string;
}

This is something i came across after doing some reading though the PHP
manual and some of the user comments on the subject.

If anything knows of a more effective and efficient method, I'd love to know
about it.

Thanks,
Yusuf.

Sounds like you're trying to write this:

http://php.net/html_entity_decode

When you think you need to remove the escaping from something, you're
almost always doing something wrong.

Escaping preserves data in another context, so if you ever need to
remove it, it's a good indication that either you didn't need it in the
first place, or you've chosen the wrong escaping function for a
particular context (e.g., htmlspecialchars() for an SQL query).

Hope that helps.

Chris

The overhead of a table that you may not use is about zero.  Why not
just create the table and assume it's already there. That way you can
forget the test all together.

Just another crazy idea!  :-)

Hello Paul

            if exists(!Customer_Info)  //Here it doesn't work, error!!!!

Is 'Customer_Info' a constant?
Otherwise I dont see how this works, its not a function (), its not a variable $..I'm not big on OOPHP some if that is some sorta construct
ignore my message.

ps: These are some wrappers I use to make my code simpler to look at.

{
    $cIp    = $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"];
    $dbName = $sqlInfo['databaseUser'];
    $dbPass = $sqlInfo['databasePass'];
    $db = mysql_pconnect("", $dbName, $dbPass);
    if ( $db )
    {
        error_log("DBAS: $cIp connected to mysql server");
    }
    else

  Subject: [nycphp-talk] Mysql question!


  Hi, everybody!

  I want to ask you all to help me out in solving my database question.

  Here is what I want to accomplish:

  I want to add my users, one by one, to my Mysql database via a registration form.

  When a user fills out a registration form, my script should gather all the information

  and add them to the database. I pretty much got all that part working, but I want my

  script to check to see whether a table exists or not. If it doesn't exist, my script

  should create a table and then proceed to add the information to the database;

  and if it does exist, then it should not create one and proceed to use the existed table.

  1) Is there a php function that take care of this job that I can use?

  I tried to use: if exists(mytablename)

  but, it doesn't work.

  Here is my code: (some codes are left out for illustration purpose.)

  <?php
  include("dbinfo.inc.php");
    class TableInfo
         {
          function _construct()    //A Constructor
             {
              /* Initialize database */
              mysql_connect($localhost,$username,$password);

This isn't a propos of your question, but that ain't a constructor. You
need two leading underscores:

function __construct() {

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Processing, please wait logic flow question
Message-ID: <000001c6fc92$d969eb60$12a8a8c0@HirschLaptop>

Many web sites display a "processing please wait" page after submitting
an order, request, etc. and then display the final confirmation page
when it's available.
 
I'm confused by how that works. Does the server-side script spit out a
"processing" page by flushing the output buffer and then redirect when
the script is completed? Or does the client-side JavaScript display the
"processing" page while the server script goes about its business?

You can do this a few ways, depending on how involved you want to get.

The simplest is just to use some javascript to replace the content of
the current page with a 'processing....' message while the server does
its business.  This works pretty well but doesn't give the user any
feedback about what's going on.

The more complicated approach is to launch the actual processing script
in the background, the refresh a 'processing...' page until it finishes.

With this method you can show the status of the background task, but it
takes a lot more effort to get it right (eg, using a wrapper script to
allow communication between the 'backend' and 'frontend' scripts.

I use both of these methods with good success, it really depends on the
kind of task you are performing.  That said, there are myriad other ways
to achieve this, and I'm sure everyone on the list has their own favorite.

Cliff,

I believe the most common solution is to have the your processing  
script launch a sub-process to run in the background, and then return  
a response page that periodically refreshes (via javascript) to poll  
the server for some flag indicating that the process has completed.  
(Ex: checking for the existence of a file or something like that).

You launch the sub-process using exec() or some other function in  
that family. http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.exec.php

The trick with these functions is that the calling script halts when  
the function is called and waits for the sub-process to complete and  
return a result. You can prevent this by setting the sub-process to  
run in the background and redirecting its output (STDERR _and_  
STDOUT) to go to a file (or nowhere).

Here's an example:

exec("php takes-a-long-time.php > /dev/null 2>&1 &");

takes-a-long-time.php would do something time-consuming, and when it  
completed, would deposit a file somewhere or add a line to a file to  
indicate that it was complete.

There are lots of related comments in the user contributed notes on  
the exec page that I linked to above. I guess there are some  
potential problems with trying to do this on a windows server -- I've  
only done this on unix servers.

The other gotcha I've run into is that that php goes CRAZY if you try  
this on a server that is running php as a CGI. If you call a php sub- 
process from a php page it goes into a recursive loop and eventually  
chokes. I'd be curious to hear if others have run into this problem.  
Any solutions?

***

I believe there is another way to tackle this issue which involves  
some fancy output buffering. The page only partially downloads and  
then keeps the connection open while it waits for the rest of the  
script complete. Anyone else familiar with this technique?

Message-ID: <556034ce0610302025j10592888g2d2b1b41a61ef5bf@mail.gmail.com>

Problem Statement: With the click of a button, I need to open a new window
(to capture "user referrals"), and pass to it a parameter that will be used
to track the user id of the individual who originated those referrals.

I have no problems opening the window with the button click:
I can't quite get the syntax, however, to pass the user_id parameter...
How do I go about passing the user_id parameter to the newly open window?

CODE:

Do you know anybody who may benefit from using XYZ System?
      <label>
      <input name="Referrals" type="radio" value="N" checked="checked" />
      No</label>
      <label>
      <input type="radio"  name="Referrals" value="Y"
onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/Pop%20Ups/Referrals.php','Referrals','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=600')"/>
      Yes<br />

Your assistance is appreciated.

Thanks!

Ariel.

Ariel,

Assuming user_id is a PHP variable, you should be able to do it like this.

<input type="radio"  name="Referrals" value="Y"
onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/Pop%20Ups/Referrals.php?user_id=<?=$user_id?>','Referrals','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=600')"/>
     Yes<br />

And in referrals.php...

<?
 $user_id = $_GET['user_id'];
?>

That's *one* way to do it. However, it's very insecure. If you're
setting variables like user_id they should never be accessible from a
GET param where the user can manipulate it directly. It would be best
to set user_id in a SESSION variable somewhere - then you can access
it from any page you want without having to worry about constantly
passing it as a parameter.

If you don't need the initial server-side script to use the variable
until the form in the new window is submitted, you can also use
JavaScript to copy the variable from the old window into the new Window.
For example, you can copy it into a hidden input field.

Interesting. This seems like a great idea for uploads. But isn't the
"please wait, thinking" situation different. And how do you know when to
use "please wait, thinking," If Ticketmaster or Sabre knows it will take
30 seconds to process a request, that's one thing. But theoretically,
all requests are instantaneous until there not. Which mean you have to
monitor requests or, more likely, know that an external call, like a
request to a credit card gateway, will take a while.

I still like the idea of Dell's output buffering. Seems to me you can
spit out a "processing" page by flushing the output buffer and then
issue a redirect when the script is complete.

I use the following. It's simple, and it works. It displays the message 
"Please wait while we process your request", and immediately redirects 
to the url that does the actual work. The "processing" message will 
remain on the user's browser until your other php script returns data.

<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" 
content="0;url=http://yourdomain.com/process.php">
</head>

<body>
<p>Please wait while we process your request...<p />
</body>

How is this triggered? Is this called by the requesting button/form? If so,
don't you lose the post/get variables?

Looking at it from the user's perspective, the user enters some URL and 
gets a page back with a form and a submit button. The user fills out the 
form and clicks the submit button. The request comes in to you, and you 
then respond to that request by sending the html I showed earlier. If 
you have variables you want to pass to what I called process.php, one 
possibility is to append them to the url, like this:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=http://yourdomain.com/process.php?name1=value1&name2=value2">

Depending on how secure your data needs to be, this may or may not be 
acceptable, but it's an option.

Cute. And javascript free. :)

However, there is a limitation to this kind of approach: It will only  
work for requests that will return before your connection times out.  
In many cases, this probably isn't a huge issue as the "slow" script  
might only take about 30 seconds to run, or something like that. But  
what about a script that builds a large, compressed archive, or runs  
a complex index, or something like that. Now were talking minutes,  
and the web server will eventually timeout.

That's when you need to fire up that sub-process to run in the  
background, and just use the browser to poll the server to check if  
the process finished.

While we're on the subject how about for something like an image upload (say
20 MB)?  It would be nice to know how to give the user a "processing" page
(perhaps even with a % done indicator)

"if exists" is a sql thing.  i.e. DROP TABLE tablename IF EXISTS; or 
CREATE TABLE tablename IF NOT EXISTS;

Here's one way to check if your mysql table doesn't exist with php:

if (mysql_query("DESCRIBE Customer_Info") === false)
{
    // create the table
}

FYI, there's a nyphp-mysql list that mysql-specific php questions can be 
sent to.

You need to be cool and do it the web 2.0 way (slick effects  
optional) ... :-)

<script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>

<input type="radio" name="Referrals" value="Y" onclick="$ 
('#Referrals').show()"/> Yes

<div id="Referrals" style="display: none;">
<!-- no need to pass any variables around -->
</div>

This is the topic I always wondered about but was afraid to ask!

True or false:  You could accomplish this easily if you were doing the
AJAX thing. Right? Look at the what-its, the readyState property and keep
the "Please wait..." in your DIV (or whatever) element until your
readyState == 4

Of course, yeah, obviously, Javascript required.

True. AJAX makes the not-a-real-progress indicator coding way easy (no 
background process).  Just show the processing wheel/image what-have you 
while the readyState<>4, then just do a layer swap/close the 
window...whatever.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT] live slide-show delivery via browser only
Message-ID: <45478B25.5080906@polymerdb.org>

Hi All,

I'm looking for a free/OSS (preferably PHP-oriented) solution to this 
problem:  Deliver paged content (eg., typical still-frame slide show) to 
any number of viewers via the web browser only, while providing only the 
host/operator with the controls to advance the slides in real time;  and 
don't require the user to have anything other than a decent Internet 
connection and fairly modern browser.

If nobody knows of an existing package like this, it seems it would be 
fairly simple to build, no?  Page-forward/back/jump commands could be 
sent by the operator to a database or file on the server, and some 
Javascript in the viewer could be monitoring the server for those 
commands and then adjust the display accordingly. 

Question: Is this
a) so self-apparent and easy that nobody's bothered to develop a package 
for it?
b) much more complicated than I've explained and thus potentially a 
waste of time?
or
c)  contained already in some fairly simple CGI package you know about 
and I don't?

Thanks,
Allen

I once saw a very nice slide show presented using S5:

Hi Chris,

Yes, I had seen S5 before and thought it a pretty nifty setup.  But does 
it allow the operator to control page-advance in real time?  The idea is 
that if you're having a meeting with one or more remote viewers, you 
could discuss by phone while showing them one slide at a time, at your 
discretion.

I haven't heard of a free/OSS solution... but I agree it would be pretty 
simple to do like you described.  The viewers would have ajax code that 
would periodically ask the server if the slide has been updated.  The 
server-side script could send back the html for the current slide and 
the viewer code would replace the current slide with the new html.  The 
jquery javascript library makes this really easy.  Then you need a 
seperate client for the operator that would have the controls for 
forward/jump/back - that doesn't even have to be done with ajax.

I think the only minor concern here is to benchmark that your web server 
can handle the amount of polling that will be done by the ajax viewer 
client for the number of viewers that you expect.  You can put some kind 
of simple caching in the server-side viewer so that it doesn't really 
need to process anything during the polling... just send back the 
contents of a cache file that is recreated each time the operator 
changes the current slide.  You could also have the client keep track of 
the current slide id and it could send that to the server when it asks 
for an update.  The server could see if the slide id sent from the 
client matches the current slide and then tell the client it doesn't 
have to update anything.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] exif_thumbnail
Message-ID: <45479B47.4040104@gmx.net>

Hi,

    I want to use exif_thumbnail to extract the thumbnail of an image 
and then have it displayed within a page. The page will have content 
before and after the thumbnail, and the thumbnail may be present or not. 
In order to have it show correctly, all manuals state to send the 
content setting using header(). Since this is supposed to be embedded in 
other content, I can't send the header (already started output).

So how do I get my thumbnail to show up on my page? Any simple 
solutions? Do I need to turn the string into a temp file first and then 
use that?

I googled for a solutions, but it seems that everyone only wants to show 
the thumbnail image without anything else on a page.


Any help is greatly appreciated.

The nice thing about AJAX is the first "A", "Asynchronous".

How much trouble would we cause if a page's onload event called an AJAX 
function called "getNextSlide()".  Upon receiving the request, the 
server could sleep until a new slide is loaded (or sleep for 2 seconds 
and check, sleep for 2 seconds and check, etc.).

Once a new slide is loaded the server finally sends a slide back to the 
browser.  The AJAX on the browser activates the slide and then calls 
getNextSlide() again, re-starting the loop.

As always, the balance is between responsiveness and drag.  You can get 
away with this for a few users, but having a lot of open connections 
checking something over and over will die fast at high volume.

What you want to do is use the "<img>'" tag in your script. The "src" 
attribute should point to a script that will send the image back.

Quick example (no error checking done...)
Main script
<?php
   <img src="tn.php?f=image.jpg">
?>

tn.php:
<?php
    $image = exif_thumbnail($_GET['f'], $width, $height, $type);
    header('Content-type: ' .image_type_to_mime_type($type));
    echo $image;
?>

Hi Allen,

It really sounds like you are looking for an alternative (albeit
stripped down) version of webex.  Some Googling brought this up:

http://dimdim.com/

Can't speak for it and can't even say I made it past the first page,
but from the description it sounds promising.  And free.

Let us know how you make out solving this problem.

I think the scientific term is called "webinar" :-)

https://www.gotowebinar.com
http://www.campfirenow.com

Campfire is interesting in that you can post images/slides to the  
group so it would be a quick hack (or something to model off of).

There was a nice piece of software a few years back that gave Java  
presentations/webinars with a sandboxed console so you can play  
around in the shell @ the same time, no luck refinding it but thought  
that was a nice touch.

Hi Paul,

You always need to escape each of the user submitted values in your
SQL, in order to prevent breakage and security vulnerabilities. The
mysql_real_escape_string() function is the recommended way to do this.

function dbEsc( $value ) {
  return mysql_real_escape_string( $value );
}

function AddNewCustomer( $FirstName ) {
  $query = 'INSERT INTO Customer_Info ( FirstNameCol )
                             VALUES ("'. dbEsc($FirstName) . '")';
  return mysql_query($query);
}

This is one of the two fundamental rules of secure web programming
with php (the other being that you always escape output values using
htmlentities()).

Currently impossible with vanilla php, because the post request isn't
handed off to your scripts until after the upload has finished.

If you're feeling brave, Christian Stocker has written an extension
for php 5.2 that enables upload progress, see his blog entry from last
month: http://tinyurl.com/yxrleh

Haven't tried it, wouldn't use it in production, but quite glad to see
the possibility that we'll be able to do this in the near future!

I'm not sure what exif_thumbnail() would do with a non-image, but to
protect against $_GET['f'] == "../../../etc/passwd" you'd probably
better make that:

<?php
$imagesource = '/path/to/images';
$imagepath = $imagesource.'/'.$_GET['f'];
if ( strpos( $imagepath, '..' ) === TRUE ) exit("No way.");
$image = exif_thumbnail( $imagepath, $width, $height, $type );
header('Content-type: ' .image_type_to_mime_type($type));
header('Content-length: '.strlen($image));
echo $image;
?>

I said it was a quick example with no error checking. I would put a 
check to make sure it's really an image file, check for "../", check 
for "http://", etc.  Actually, in real life, I would just pass part 
of the file or use some other non-obvious method to pass the file to 
the thumbnail script.

A side note here about mysql_real_escape_string - curious if anyone is 
an expert on this...  In that last year, I switched over from using 
addslashes to using mysql_real_escape_string to escape strings in sql 
statements because it's the 'right thing to do.'

I'm currently reading "Building Scalable Web Sites" by Cal Henderson 
(which I think is great so far for anyone making large [or potentially 
large] web apps).  In the section about avoiding sql injection attacks, 
he says "the more complicated mysql_real_escape_string escapes a bunch 
more characters but is ultimately unnecessary (although useful for 
making logs easier to read)."  I thought that was interesting - 
"ultimately unnecessary."

Although I guess this argument will be moot as soon as people move to 
php 5/mysql 5, as prepared statements seem to be the way to go there.

So are their any real tangible advantages to mysql_real_escape_string as

mysql_real_escape_string takes into consideration the character set which
addslashes doesn't.

You are safe if you're using ansi-8859 or utf-8, but other character
encodings which have valid characters ending in 0x5c will not be properly
escaped by addslashes.

Chris has an example of this here: http://shiflett.org/archive/184

This is also a good spot to check for magic quotes, strip conflicting
line-breaks + whatever else you may need:

function dbEsc( $value ) {
	$value = trim( $value );

	if( get_magic_quotes_gpc() ) {
		$value = stripslashes( $value );
	}

	$value = str_replace("\n\r", "\n", $value);
	$value = str_replace("\r\n", "\n", $value);

	return mysql_real_escape_string( $value );
}

Cool... I thought Chris might have something on this.  The previous 
chapter is all about unicode/utf-8 - why you should use it, how you make 
sure that your input is valid utf-8, etc... so maybe he was making the 
statement in that context where everything has already been converted to 
valid utf-8 (and the database uses utf-8 for its tables).
Thanks a lot!

I just read the same thing in Cal's book and was going to ask the group
about this. While prepared statements sound nice in theory, there are
many of us that still hack together "old-fashioned" queries. And what
does "ultimately unnecessary" mean anyway? Consumes more mips than its
worth?

Hi,

    I would use a session and write whatever I need somewhere else into 
the session. As long as the session is kept alive you can grab from it 
whatever you need. No GET, no POST, and definitely no JavaScript. ;-)

Hi,

    from my experience, addslashes does the trick for the most part, but 
mysql_real_escape_string is indeed the better one to use as it does 
cover all possible (not only the likely) characters that could get MySQL 
and its user in hot water.
    From a practical viewpoint I'd just say both work fine and are 
better than nothing with the difference that mysql_real_escape_string 
requires a database connection before it can be called whereas 
addslashes doesn't. So when you just want to massage some input through 
a bunch of scripts that do not do anything with the database, then 
addslashes may be the more convenient thing to use. So far I haven't 
come across a situation where it would have mattered, but since I'm a 
just for fun PHP hobbyist and not a pro, it is well possible that there 
are situation where it does make a difference.

Hi,

    my guess is that some of the characters escaped using the mysql 
escaping cannot be reasonably expected to come in from user input. 
Mysql_real_escape_string escapes all these:
\x00, \n, \r, \, ', " and \x1a
    but I can't think of any way on how to get \x1a as user input 
(assuming that this is the hex value for an ASCII character). Even NULL 
is difficult, but not impossible. I guess that the "ultmately 
unecessary" looks at it from a viewpoint of what is possible assuming 
the user is the idiot and not the developer. It consumes a trip to the 
database engine and back, whereas addslashes doesn't. I don't know, my 
arguments are a bit thin and it may really just like that: "ultimately 
unecessary" as long as the string was addslashed.

This brings up an interesting point. Many people slam prepared
statements for being slow for non-repetitive querys. However, if you
need to make multiple trips to the database engine and back to escape a
handful of parameters, I wonder which method is actually faster --
especially if your DB is on a different server. Simply climbing up and
down the TCP/IP stack burns a lot of cycles, unless you happen to have
one of the TOEs that I have written about (TCP/IP offload/acceleration
engine). I recall seeing a performance comparison somewhere, but it's
location escapes me -- no pun intended.

What you're failing to consider here is the character set of the active
mysql connection.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding
that mysql_real_escape_string does not incur an extra trip to the
database, the escaping still occurs within php, but it takes into
account the character set of the active connection.

This may not seem that important right now, but when you find yourself
wanting/needing to switch to utf8 you'll be glad you used mysql_real_escape.

As for how strange characters might get into input, assuming that it
won't happen is just plain bad practice.  Of course the enterprising
hacker will find a way to inject these characters, and addslashes will fail.

When dealing with user input, always use the very best tools you have
available to you, because the one corner you cut will be the chink in
your application's armor.

It generally does, but not really. This is what I tried to do:
// Show thumbnail
      $exifthumbnail = exif_thumbnail($totalpath, $exifwidth, 
$exifheight, $exiftype);
      if ($exifthumbnail !== FALSE) {
            header('Content-type: ' .image_type_to_mime_type($exiftype));
            echo $exifthumbnail;
            header('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
            echo "<br />\n";
      } else {
            echo "No thumbnail available!<br />\n";
      }


And it still pipes out a whole bunch oh jibberish, that just seems to 
look different as when not sending any header info at all.

Thanks, but I'll try the other proposal. :/

You probably know this better than I do, but in any case, you need to 
have a connection established otherwise mysql_real_escape_string throws 
an error. That means that something is going back and forth to the db 
engine at some point, which isn't a big deal if one needs the connection 
anyway. Addslashes doesn't need anything.

That was mentioned in a different post and I did not mean to make it 
appear as if this doesn't happen.

I also did not mean to advertise using addslashes (I myself stopped 
doing that), but tried to get some sense into the "ultimately 
unnecessary" that was brought up by Cliff.

Message-ID: <4547F957.4030006@gmx.net>

Hi,

I have a string that looks like this
$text = 'blah, blah, blah, ';
I want to use rtrim to cut off the last comma and the whitespace. So I use
rtrim($text, ', ');

To my surprise, it doesn't cut anything off. When I echo $text the comma
and the space are still there.

Is rtrim broken or my logic or my script?

Are you reassigning the result to $text? The first argument is not  
passed by reference -- instead, it returns the trimmed string.

$text = rtrim($text, ', ');
echo $text;

BTW: if this string is build by a loop, there is another idiom that I  
find cleaner than stripping off the last separator: Build text as an  
array, then implode it.

$text = array();
foreach (range(0, 2) as $i) {
    $text[] = 'blah';
}
$text = implode(', ', $text);

Actually no, all it means is that without an active connection,
mysql_real_escape_string doesn't know what character encoding is being used.

I looked through the source and found that the php extension just passes
the string and the specified connection through to the mysql client
library's c function of the same name, which then looks up the character
set of the connection and performs the escaping.

That said, I did come across this line in the mysql documentation:

Strictly speaking, MySQL requires only that backslash and the quote
character used to quote the string in the query be escaped. This
function quotes the other characters to make them easier to read in log
files.

However, when reading through the mysql client source I do see it
performing special processing for both correctly formed and malformed
multibyte characters, as well as correctly handling the situation where
the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is enabled on the server.  This alone
is important, as addslashes will fail horribly in this situation.
