I have a question that maybe some of you can shed some light or what your
experience with this might be or how you guys handle it. I was contacted by
a potential client that wants me to create a custom program for him, I said
not a problem, my company usually reserves all the rights an any an all
programs that we create, this particular client want to own the rights to
the program, I'm a bit hesitant as I like to keep the right to programs I
create in case I get a client that wants something similar and I just need
to modify some aspects of it making the development easier and if I get a
client that ones the exact program then I can sale it to them, how do you
guys think its the best way to go about doing this?

Photographers like my wife provide two prices; a much higher rate if the
client gets all rights to the work. Give them the offer, and let them know
that you don't share information on business details with competitors. The
code blocks will likely only be 10% or so unique, won't they?

Hi,
how about sharing the copyright? I'm not sure about legal consequences but
maybe you can further investigate.

At the heart of this would be the question --  why do they want to own the
copyright? Is the software something that needs deals with securing their
systems so it needs to be kept secret or has something to do with a
proprietary process to their business? Do they have concerns that you would
do similar work for their competition? Could they have plans to market the
software you create for them? If that is the case, I can see them wanting
to own it.

Sometimes clients have misconceptions about copyright ownership and that it
implies some sort of control over something they may not need control over
at all.

You need to define what is owned.  Is it an algorithm that will help him
get a %2 return on stocks or is it just an eCommerce and he is talking
about owning the assets and have access to the code?

I normally tell my clients that there will be a copy of the code isolated
in my own environment to help speed development (its a pain when you have
to wait 3 days on a project to get started because you have to wait for ops
to set up a vhost).  I give them access to the repo on CVS so they can see
the code and have complete access to it at all times.

My usually way of handling this sort of thing is to figure out how much 
I'll make by using it over and over, and charging the sole client that 
muc h.  So you offer him exclusive rights for X or right-to-use for 
X/100 (whatever you figure the two values are).  So does he want to pay 
$5,000 or $500,000?  If he thinks right-to-use is expensive, wait until 
he hears what exclusive right to sell software costs.  (Microsoft 
doesn't make $5,000 on a new version of Windows.  Use that as an example.)

I'd rather not do the job than give the work away for less than I think 
it's worth to me.

Not that it helps much, but his argument isn't valid. We all pay for
software we can't own or re-sell, but make full use of it. I think your
reasoning for keeping the copyright is very valid, because it would be a
pain in the neck to track and seek permission each time you wanted to base
a new project on an existing one, especially if you got turned down.

You could consider having a written agreement which gives him the option
(for a limited period of time like 2 years, after which you retain all
rights and control and it reverts to a non-exclusive license) to be able to
sell the software in return for perhaps a percentage of sales or an
additional fee. Or write the agreement where he does own the entire
copyright for a higher fee to start with. Kind of a pay me now or pay me
later agreement. Sometimes it's better to give clients a choice of things
so they can select what is most important to them. If he feels very
confident in his ability to sell this he may be able to justify the higher
fee to own it all. Or doesn't mind waiting to see how he does with selling
it and it cost him nothing extra until it starts to be sold.

It would also be a good idea talk with an attorney who specializes
in Intellectual Property which covers copyrights, patents, etc.

+1 for the two prices approach.

A good way to explain this to the client is that any program you write is
going to be made of bits and pieces of past client's programs in order to
save everyone time and money. As a bonus, they get code that has been
proven to work in the past. In return, they need to allow you to reuse any
non-proprietary code that you create while working for them.

Proprietary code needs to be written from scratch and isolated from other,
non-proprietary parts of the program, so it costs extra. How much extra
depends on how much of the final code it is.

It would be a very good practice for you to create and maintain a shared
library that is distinct from work written exclusively for one client or
another. Then it becomes really obvious who owns the copyright to what: you
own the copyright to the library code, and your client owns the copyright
to their program.

Also, +1 to lawyering up. That's another expense that gets passed on to
clients who are finicky about copyright issues.

Not too long ago I decided to sit down and quickly sample all the popular frameworks again (Symfony, Slim, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Yii). I didn't want to spend more than an hour getting each up and running and playing with it. Laravel was on that list and I was eager to try it since it was designed really with only PHP >=5.3 in mind. 

I never really got very far with it since it requires mcrypt to work even in it's most basic form. I did not have mcrypt installed, so that added time. It required DocumentRoot to be set and a writeable directory (storage/views) to work. A bit of extra work just to get a page up and ate into my self imposed 1 hour limit.
It largely (completely?) uses static class references, which I am not a big fan of. It is convenient since the static references are  easily accessible from anywhere. But it means you can't overload it and use your own classes without some difficulty. Like a lot of frameworks, you need to commit to it and the way it does things.

That said, Laravel is certainly a framework I would have on the short list of options. Symfony is also much better in v2 and they are taking a module approach. For example, Twig is now standalone.

I've used a little bit of Cake in the past but now am using CodeCharge for
production development in my company. It's a bit tight and restrictive, but
extremely, extremely fast and well-suited for complicated reports and grids
(ie, CRM, lists, etc) and other back-end functionality.

With that said, I'm looking at new frameworks for my own personal
development work, but other than Cake, I have no clue about any of the new
ones out there. Can anyone provide a good rundown of the popular frameworks
out there - ie, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Kohana, and the other ones Brent
mentioned above - based on their experiences? Like pros, cons, etc.

Hi
since composer joined our toolkit and the php-fig standardized PSR things changed a lot, now frameworks are more such an ecosystem with different components that cooperate together.

With this in mind, feel free to choose any frameworks that are PSR compliant and you'll do right, or even better choose your components and build your own framework.

It sounds like we could use another "PHP framework shootout" panel or 
presentation, like we did a few years back. 

Volunteers for the April/May/June meeting? :)

... I was saying, it could be interesting an overview of the top framework and their components.

I'll help to organize space and talk, I'm examining few components for my job and for my personal project, it could be interesting to show

Maybe if one person runs the talk and serves as a sort of moderator, other
people who use the different frameworks could give a really brief
explanation of each and serve as the "expert" to answer questions.  I can
represent for the Lithium framework as I've been using it in production for
two years and contributed a bit to the project.

Kohana is built upon Codeigniter, so sorta in the same bundle.

What are you looking to do? Expression engine is great since it is also
built on Code Igniter but gives you a CMS backend on top of it.

In Sailthru we wanted to organize tech talks, so we'll definitely have the space, let's talk next week.

Not to one-up Sailthru, Shutterstock can also host a tech talk (with pizza and beer).  We use Slim and our own home grown minimalist framework Basecoat (open sourced).

So we have the regular midtown space at IBM for most of the 4th Tuesday 
evenings of each month (including Mar 26, Apr 23, May 28, Jun 25). It 
seats 70.

The downside is we don't have refreshments at the meeting. Last time I was 
at Sailthru it was a little small, not sure if that's changed.

Regardless of location and date... Rainelemental did you want to take the 
lead as the moderator, and coordinate line up folks to describe/advocate 
individual frameworks? 

Sounds like we had experts in a few frameworks already....  Rob => 
Lithium, Frank => Kohana/Expression/CodeIgniter, Brent => Slim/Basecoat, 
Lester => CodeCharge

Surely someone will stand up for Zend Framework 2, or no? I would like to
see somebody justify the mind-boggling complexity of it.

Hi everyone, let's wrap things up: we have speakers and space, now we need
good arguments, such as success stories or new tools/frameworks.

Just wanted to add that I'm not interested in old frameworks just for the
sake of knowing them, unless there's a success story behind it. I'd
personally like to hear about current frameworks (Symfony2, ZF2, Laravel,
etc.), and mainstream methodology and tools (e.g. Composer). Let me know
what you guys think!

Agreed. Personally I would like to see a cross section of frameworks and methods. Symfony2, ZF2, Laravel are all in the same "enterprise" category. It would be educational to have some microframeworks (i.e. Slim, Silex) for comparison. Perhaps even gong so far as to have frameworks that use push vs. pull (components) for the View layer, and url dispatch vs traversal for routing. Just to show different techniques.

organizers to create groups and meet ups to discuss MODX.  I was invite to
be an Ambassador. So, as a friendly open source organizer and supporter I
accepted.

I have created a meetup group so that we can organize local meetings:
http://www.meetup.com/New-Jersey-MODX-Developers-Gather-Drink-Share-Be-Merry
/.  My goal is to run the meetings in Northern NJ.  I can also run meetings
in Manhattan, if there is enough desire.

Hans and Daniel, I would be happy to give a presentation on MODX to the
group, if it has been a while since one was delivered.  We are using MODX
for a broad spectrum of projects for start-ups through Fortune 500
companies.

For those of you that don't know, MODX is the best Open Source PHP Content
Management System and Framework around.  We have been using it for about 5
years and we love it.

/**  New topic  **/

As many of you know, my companies Cyber X Designs and Arteric sponsor open
source/tech events in and around NYC.  Recently, we sponsored the NY Tech
Holiday Party.

This year we are sponsoring http://www.leandayux.com/ which is happening on
March 1, 2013 downtown.  The 1 day conference is focused on implementing
lean startup and lean UX in the enterprise.  As a sponsor, they have asked
us to reach out to our network to raise awareness about the conference and
help drive ticket sales.  If you would like to attend, please contact me.
It may be possible to get discounted tickets.

I went to the conference last year and it was very good and a great value!

Warmest regards,
Hans

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Functions instantiating from Classes
Message-ID: <512A0686.2060904@gmail.com>

OOP Newbie question as I convert a crufty program to OOP

Class Person sets up various properties of a person. Classes B, C, and D 
extend A in various ways for different roles people do.

What I ran into last night was trying to use a function outside of the 
classes to instantiate objects. For example:

Function Z instantiates 3 objects of class B, one each object of class C.

Function Y instantiates one instance of class D and then runs Function Z 
3 times, for a total of 16 objects.

Function X creates one object of Class D and then calls Function 7 3 times.

What I don't know, and couldn't clearly explain on ##php last night, is 
how to have Functions X, Y, and Z be able to create objects from classes 
B, C, and D.

Any help, or good pointers to tutorials? Should I even be using 
functions? The goal is to create groups of objects based off group 
membership guidelines.

If you're well and truly bored, the full code is at:

Thanks!

Not so bored, so only took a quick look.

It seems like you're calling functions to generate objects but not
returning those objects or storing them in a global array anywhere?

You are absolutely right to be using objects for this stuff.

There's not really any difference between using a function to instantiate
objects and using a function to instantiate any other variable. You have to
return (or otherwise store) the instantiated variables if you want them to
be available outside the function scope.
