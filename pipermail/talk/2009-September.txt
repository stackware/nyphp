The problem with this approach is that you end up with the join
conditions and the 'real' selection criteria mashed together.

SELECT product_name, vendor_name, category_name
FROM product, vendor, category
WHERE vendor.id = product.vendor_id AND price > 50 AND category.id =
product.category_id AND color = 'red'

vs

SELECT product_name, vendor_name, category_name
FROM product
JOIN vendor ON vendor.id = product.vendor_id
JOIN category ON category.id = product.category_id
WHERE price > 50 AND color = 'red'

I mixed up the order of the WHERE elements in the first query for the
purposes of this example, but I have seen stuff like that in production
code.

Dan:

I need to understand joins much better than I do now because the 
first query I fully understand while the second I don't.

I think the idea is less a matter of promotion and more to let the
programmer use whatever table / column names they prefer regardless of
best practices.  If they do it for everything they don't have to
maintain a list of reserved words, which may very well change between
versions.

I personally prefer prefixing column names with table names
(person_first_name, location_city, etc) for clarity in complex joins,
but if I really had some reason to name a varchar (can't think of
why), I'd prefer that my tools would allow me to do so.

As for joins, I agree with Dan Cech regarding explicitly naming join
types, join fields, and join conditions in the join...on rather than
the conditions.

Think of the WHERE clause as the filter.  Use it to place restrictions
on what information is returned.

WHERE price > 50 AND color = 'red'

In the previous example you also had things like "vendor.id =
product.vendor_id."  You aren't using this to filter the data.  You
are using it to link up two tables.  This is where the JOIN clause
comes in.  For example, if you want a list of products with their
associated vendors:

FROM products
INNER JOIN vendors ON products.vendor_id = vendors.id -- or whatever
the fields are called

To also link to an optional promotion running for a product:

LEFT OUTER JOIN promotions ON products. promotion_id = promotions.id

Kristina, this is so true. The moment I started dealing with more than
one table in a query I realized that I was probably going to get myself
in trouble if my id names weren't more specific, so I decided to opt for
the more cautious route even if it meant more typing.

I was starting to waver in my resolve though, so I'm glad you explained
things so well as it'll keep me from getting lazy.

It's good to know the flipside--thanks.

You know, a couple of times I switched my naming conventions and it was
a PITA, so I can definitely see the wisdom in your advice. I finally
decided to just stick with a underscore as it's second nature to me
after all my years of front end production.

I fully understand WHERE, it's understanding how JOIN's simplify things.

Well, there are different types of joins. The Where join always gives an inner 
join - says someone who didn't really get joins either. Using the join makes 
things to be more systematic, which will help a lot when you join across a 
dozen tables and use Where filters that are based on the result of other 
queries. It might just be that we never came across such complicated queries, 
which exposed us never to any cases where using something else than the WHERE 
join would make much difference.
You may want to check out the pages about SQL join on W3C schools.

1. Joins make your sql more readable (and are a substatement to the
FROM clause, and should be indented)

2.  When you use the WHERE clause, it is easy to accidentally do a
cartesian join, and select bazillions of rows during development.

3. You can change to a LEFT join as needed.  Since you can't do a left
join in the where clause, you might as well use the JOIN syntax
everywhere.

Consider
SELECT user.name, COUNT(post.post_id) as post_count
FROM user
  LEFT JOIN post USING user_id
GROUP BY 1

vs

SELECT user.name, COUNT(post.post_id) as post_count
FROM user
  INNER JOIN post USING user_id
GROUP BY 1

The second one can be rewritten using a WHERE clause, but the first one can't.

People who don't understand the first query, end up writing stuff like:

SELECT user.name, (SELECT COUNT(*) from post WHERE
post.user_id=user.user_id) as post_count
FROM user

Hi all,

I periodically read through PHP job ads that call for various levels of 
expertise, without a solid understanding what the expectations are.  I 
come from outside the world of formal IT education, largely self-taught 
in coding and server admin, so for one thing I may be missing patches of 
assumed "core" knowledge.

Does anyone have suggestions for guidelines or app design/code samples 
of what's considered appropriate for an 
Entry-Level/Junior/Senior/OOP/whatever PHP position, or 
mistakes/shortcomings that may be typical or unacceptable at these levels?

Many thanks,

Here's a Rails-based perspective, and a good one:

This can easily be mapped to PHP.

You may as well ask the meaning of life - this is a big subject and there 
are many many approaches and techniques, but we need more details to even 
begin to help.

Is it the server-side PHP that is slow or your frontend code? Do you use 
any kind of caching? Are you using a templating library? Is this 
'straight' PHP or are you using a framework / library? What kind of 
database? Which version of PHP? Have you looked at any profiling tools? If 
you're using Firebug, have you looked at using the YSlow extension to look  
at frontend performance?

That's a good list to start with...

Hi Mangesh,

Is this the same website you posted about a week or two back where you 
were using a DSN to connect to an Access database?

Get a faster web server with a bigger pipe? Do you self-host or have it 
hosted? Which system are your unning it on? Which web server do you use on 
which OS?

Did you strip down code and queries? I mean, make a decision if you really 
need to run all these queries and all that code. Did you run an profiler 
against the database and your code? What exactly is slow?

Do you use a lot of client side scripting (aka JavaScript)? If yes, you might 
find that to be your biggest slowdown.

Or you can have less users access your web site....see, without more 
information I cannot come up with better proposals.

You really need to find where the bottleneck is, then focus on that.
If it's just a lot of code or data being moved around, then cache it
and/or create summaries.
If the data doesn't change that often, then you shouldn't rerun the
same queries every time, just save the result.

Your code may be optimized, but how much of it are you loading at
once? Remember, PHP has reload everything on every hit. Load only
what's needed for the current task. How long does it take your system
to output "Hello World", without putting in any special code to handle
such a simple case?

assigned an object to $objet)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Bad ISP Problem: Need New Domain Registration,
	Management and Hosting 	Service
Message-ID: <78c6bd860909040903h53b8b833n26064d61896ee02e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have a problem. I cannot get the ISP I registered my domains with to
reply to my support requests. Initially they did respond to my request
and said they would look into the issue. However, I did not receive
any response since. I have sent numerous emails to them in the past
week and a half and tried sending new fresh ones without their ticket
number so that I received their automated acknowledgment with a new
ticket number (which I did receive so I know I'm not just getting
filtered). But still I have not heard from them at all. If I call
their hosting support group I get run around for 3 minutes before the
robotic woman invariably says "we are unable to take your call right
now" and hangs up.

So I'm looking for opinions about ISPs that handle domain
registration, domain management (basically DNS zone record updating)
and some hosting (with PHP of course) and how to transfer those
domains. I actually host my important stuff myself on a virtual
private server so I am primarily interested in domain registration and
management. The current ISP has very crude utilities for managing the
domains, changing DNS and so on. It can be a chore just to login and
operate their "control panel".

Can anyone recommend an ISP that has the following:

 * good responsive support
 * good, easy to use utility for managing domains, registering new
ones, adjusting DNS zone info, etc
 * affordable domain registration
 * affordable hosting with PHP
 * free hosting for small static sites

Has anyone had any experience with transferring domains from one
company to another? I assume I just get DNS setup with the new ISP as
far as I can and then get the old ISP to transfer the domains to the
new ISP. But considing I have had zero contact with the soon-to-be-old
ISP, I'm wondering how I can actually get this done. It's not like I
can just tell my credit card company to stop all payments - they
control my domains.

Also, if I paid for a domain for say 10 years, do I have to pay full
price all over again?

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Mike

As a Lifetime Baseball fan (married over home plate back in 2000), career-long web-programmer (I remember when NYPHP was first getting started), and long time stalker of this list, I second Kristina's "Love It".

As programmers, we spend a lot of time using metaphors to explain what we are doing in a way easily understood by others. I've even explained the ins-and-outs of MX records by using a "delivery to an upscale apartment building" metaphor.  But the baseball metaphor and Tao reference are best I've seen in a while... both for their simplicity and universal (at least in North America) appeal.

And to think that I overlooked the original posting.  Thanks Kristina.
Thanks for making my Friday interesting.

Hey, you're welcome, but you should really thank Mr. Mintz as he's the 
one who's responsible.

An empty box score is a really good way to explain NULL, I gotta hand 
it to him.

If anyone wants to write a Taoist poem, in pseudocode, about how NULL 
is like an inning of baseball yet to be played...now THAT would be 
cool.

Why does your *ISP* need to handle domain registration? Why not do it 
yourself directly with a domain registrar? Many domain registrars offer 
DNS too at no extra charge - that way you keep control of DNS and domains 
and you can manage any migrations yourself.

If you are listed as the administrative contact on a domain, then you have 
the authority to transfer that domain to another registrar.

I have about 10 sites with www.addaction.net -- and the primary reason i
have expanded my sites with them is their incredibly responsibe support.
they use cPanel for administration that the website owner uses (and it's
quite good). rates are good -- check out their site for a standard intro
special ($49/year). they are associated with a Registrar. my sites are
pretty fast but i never have much action (at least my clients have never
complained).

hth/spirits,

seth

I am totally, 100% pleased with addaction. they're in nyc

By "ISP" I mean the domain registrar and not Internet access. So AFAIK
I'm already doing it directly.

But I also need minimal hosting. I have one site that is just a static
page with two images and another for a family member to learn PHP and
web stuff. I would rather host these off of my VPS. I even paid an
extra $50 for the PHP site.

Someone recommend eNom but it is considerably more expensive. I
suppose I got what I paid for.

I don't understand why it should cost more than $10 / yr to host a few
DNS records and maybe a static web page.

Maybe the current "ISP" is trying to get rid of me and not answering
support requests is their way of dropping customers that don't buy
enough extra services.

Ah, not just in North America. Baseball is popular in Japan, Central

One of those exports the US can feel proud of, unlike, e.g., McDonald's.

As for Tao and all that, don't get me started, it's a favorite subject. My
sig is excerpted from a poem that has several published translations, known
where I come from as "The Identity of Relative and Absolute", by the 8th
century Chinese Ch'an (Zen) Master Shitou. It's in the Zen tradition, but
has a strong Taoist influence.

You know the deal:  Ordinary mind is Tao.

Have a great weekend.

    Well,  last I heard the player's union was insisting that players 
should be allowed to take amphetamines during the game so they don't 
fall asleep.  Maybe someday they'll provide amphetamines to the fans as 
well...

1and1.com has fairly cheap domain registration and basic DNS 
functionality. They keep your credit card on file so buying more domains 
is easy (not so good if your account is hacked though!) and the domains 
auto-renew every year so you don't have to worry about losing one to 
expiration.  I don't use them for hosting, so i can't say anything about 
that. Their support through mail wasn't too helpful but their system 
just works, so there isn't much need for support.

Fans don't need amphetamines.  Being a Mets fan, I can tell you it's so 
agitating watching their games ... almost as agitating as their 
management press conferences... that it should come with a 
warning "Limit Caffeine Use While Viewing This Product."

And as for Yankees fans, half of them will need to be sedated and 
deprogrammed after they royally flame out in the playoffs again next 
month.

As for the players, this time of year especially, I bet every game 
starts to feel like a day game after a night game, and we all know how 
that goes...I guess a few million bucks a year just isn't enough to 
keep them awake.

I also run my own DNS for some domains on my own virtual server, Im 
paying $20/month for my own private server with Linode (linode.com). I use 
that for hosting some small sites, hosting email, and as a server to play 
around/develop code on.

Well, maybe the overpaid, pillpopping, spitting players got their big bellies 
from McDonald's food? Being a foreign kid I find baseboll excruciatingly 
boring, but I guess that can be said about any event of the entertainment 
industry that borrows heavily from sports. Same with soccer in Germany, games 
are now played at noon just so that more pay TV channels in Asia will pay big 
bucks.
That said, there are semi-professional baseball leagues in Germany. See the 
current standings for the first league here:
http://www.baseball-softball.de/bundesliga/index.php?id=00000105
Nice to see that they have playdowns like a real sports league. Apparently, 
the Richrath Saints from my hometown are no longer playing. But we still got 
the Longhorns (http://www.langenfeld-longhorns.com/index.php?id=11) and the 
now independent Cheerleaders (http://www.cll-cheerleader.de/index.php) who are 
the new German Champions!
Also, the DEL (German Icehockey League) started today and there are plenty of 
US players (see here: http://www.del.org/). But me being a soccer guy I rather 
stay with my favorite club (http://www.borussia.de/de/home,2,0.html), which 
signed Michael Bradley, son of the coach of the US men's national soccer team. 
Borussia M?nchengladbach was also the club where Kasey Keller played several 
seasons.

OK, now what has that to do with a PHP mailing list? All these sites use PHP, 
which is probably an even more spectacular export than baseball.


Happy PHPing,

David

I pretty much agree here. I have always used GoDaddy for Domains and I 
have never had a problem. I used Yahoo once for registering my domain 
many years ago, and it was just a pain in the butt. I have also used 
GoDaddy for hosting and have been happy with them and thought there 
prices were fair. Though admittedly I never looked around that much for 
Domain registration or Hosting.

We've had problems with GoDaddy hosting recently.

One client got email blacklisted because their hosted site shares the
same IP address as a big spam operation (Columbia.edu wouldn't even
deliver mail sent from other addresses with the organization's URL in
it).

Another client ended up on the Firefox/Google malware blacklist when
their hosted site was compromised. Many other domains on the same box
were compromised at the same time.

Fast, cheap, secure. Choose two.

Hello,

I have, and still use, nexcess.net for all my hosting and domains.

I have a reseller plan w/them, so it is more than you want to pay, but
their customer support is amazing and you might want to at least take
a look.

I've used goDaddy, but I had problems with addresses being blacklisted.
I also didn't have much success with their customer support (nor did I 
expect to).

I also used completeHostingSolutions for a few years, but they are ***** 
and
nearly had to enter a legal battle to get my domain's released (along 
with various BBB complaints) -
I'd advise against them.

Good luck.

- Ben

Make life VERY simple. It's not perfect, but it works:

PICK the worlds biggest registrar of names, godaddy. use them.  They will
answer your calls on the spot 24 hours a day. Right from Phoenix, AZ. I have
had zero problems with their tech support. They have been great to me. They
have millions of sites registered with them.

PICK the worlds biggest data center for hosting, hostgator. They will answer
your online help in 30 seconds. I suspect outsourced tech help to  China,
but they know their stuff. Rock solid. These guys host hundreds of thousands
of web sites. They know what they are doing.

No worries, no problems. Life is short. Don't waste a minute with this sh*t.
Just move on to coding, You should have ZERO problems with hosting (or
almost) at this point.  It's not 1995.

Both of these guys are not perfect, but they are number 1.

Dreamhost is ok, but I like LIVE support. Which hostgator has.

Turns out I'm already hosting a site with GoDaddy and didn't even
realize it until I called them asking about their service. Duh. So I
have initiated transfer of all of my domains to them.

Incidentally, the now old ISP finally responded to my issue. But they
had to convert my account in some goofy way to do it. That's probably
what took them so long. And it still didn't really solve my issue.

But that's not the worst of it. They sent me an email with my password
in it totally in the clear. That should be against the law. It so
happened to be close to a password I use for banking and such. I just
spent the last hour changing passwords.

Man will I be glad when the transfers to GoDaddy are complete.

Hi All,

I'm looking for ideas on putting an "open source clause" into my 
development contracts.  (Sure I'll talk it out with my attorney, but I 
want to come to him with something better than "please think about this 
and bill me for your ruminations.")

All I want (ha!) is to get paid for my labor /and/ to have the option of 
then releasing that work under an Open Source license.  Sure, it's not 
appropriate for many clients, but I think many of my existing clients 
wouldn't care.

My main concern here is based on the notion that my typical development 
work is "work for hire" and thus IP developed in the course of that work 
belongs to the client, not to me.

Anyway, I'm not fishing for a debate about licensing terms or contract 
law.  I'm just wondering if anyone here does or has done jobs like this, 
and how you a) explain it to your clients verbally, and b) phrase it 
contractually. 

Anybody?

When I freelanced I was always very up front about my desire to work
with open source libraries and write open source code. Most clients
didn't care, a few thought it was a neat idea.

I once explained to someone that if they let me release the source
code, they would get a 25% discount on the project. I might have
padded my initial bid hoping this would happen. ;-) Later, I just made
it clear that open source was how I worked. Simple, easy, and every
project benefitted from the ones that came before.

As for contract, just pick a license (BSD seems to raise fewer hackles
than GPL, but again most non-programmers don't care) and say something
like: Client will retain the copyright to all work for hire, but
agrees to release the project source code under the <specific license
here> license.

I don't think you really want to be more specific than that in a
contract. What does it mean to release? Where is it posted? Leave it
alone so you can decide later.

Hi Allen,

In my view there is a difference between code that contains specific 
proprietary information or trade secrets of your client (very rare) and 
code that is reusable, modular and somewhat generic in nature (99% of 
code) and is akin to a programmer's "Toolkit" and isn't property of 
anyone but the person who uses the tools.

I think that in most cases if clients have specific concerns with 
confidentiality and code reuse, they will bring them up during 
negotiations.  Otherwise, you should yourself be cognizant of (and 
discuss with your attorney) what is considered proprietary information 
in each context, if you have concerns.  But most of your code will be 
considered "tools of the trade" and is fully reusable by you as such, 
in accordance with the GPL, at least according to my best understanding.

Otherwise any restrictions on code reuse and publication aren't 
reasonable or enforceable on the part of the client...because good code 
gets reused, that's how things are done, and you should have the right 
to reuse your code unless it violates specific trade secrets...at least 
that's my viewpoint.   I'd love to hear any specific legal advice on 
this topic.

I'm in an odd situation where I'm losing my session but only with IE8  
and only with PHP 5.2.6, not with any other browsers and not on my dev  
server with 5.3.0.

The controller script starts a session, sets a session variable,  
instantiates an object, and calls a method, about as simple as it can  
get. But the session variable is lost when the method runs. I can work  
around this by passing session vars around as parameters, but  
obviously that's a crappy solution.

Any ideas?

Michael,

Are you experiencing this issue while running the code locally? I've seen this issue related to IE8 running in protected mode for local sites. There's a setting 'Enable Protected Mode' that needs to be unchecked. 

The only other time I've seen something similar is when running code on the rackspace cloud. 

Thanks!
Ricky

Although it sounds like a php / browser version problem, I'd start by
trouble shooting with the domain and security settings in the browser.
It's likely that your dev and production boxes are different and have
different domains, IE8 might have your prod domain under not trusted sites,
and might not be accepting cookies from it.

Naming the license in the contract seems easy enough.  Of course, if the 
(non-technical, consumer-minded) client holds the copyright, there is 
very little chance they'll be enforcing the terms of the license -- but 
even with that comment I'm approaching  "IANAL" territory, so I'll stop 
here.

Thanks for your input, Chris.  Great to hear from someone who is 
actually doing this.

I look at it from a practical angle: the reason why I want the code to
be licensed as open is so that I can reuse anything useful that I
write specifically for the client. I also believe it's the right thing
to do for other reasons, but that's beside the point.

They own the copyright, which makes them feel good. It "goes with the
flow" legally by not trying to change the rules of work for hire. As
far as I'm concerned, they can do whatever they want in the future,
including going proprietary with future code.

But at any point up to that change, I can legally and ethically
incorporate functional parts of the project into my own toolkit by
following the terms set forth in the license.

Remember, if the client has property that is being worked into the
project, such as trademarked artwork, licensed fonts, or third-party
libraries, you have to be careful to keep those things separate from
the open source codebase. This could mean keeping the project split
between two repositories, but in my experience those external things
are basically static and don't need to be versioned at all.

Let us know what your lawyer thinks, Allen.

All very good points, Chris.  This discussion helps a lot in sketching 
out something to review with my lawyer.  It will be a couple of months 
before I do that -- I'm building a list of a few issues so I can make 
the best use of his billing increments. ;-)

I'll (try to remember to) report back here with feedback after that 
consultation.

aha, I had the trusted set correctly, but not the cookies (I

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Funny PHP Gotcha
Message-ID: <4AA95140.2020102@devonianfarm.com>

I ran into a gotcha today coding a PHP script...  The funny thing about 
it is that I've been writing PHP for years and haven't run into this one 
before..  The pattern is

function process_info() {
   foreach ($this->get_items() as $item) {
       // $data=array()             <--- this should have been here,  
but wasn't
       $data["X"]=$item->Y;
       if ($item->bar) {
          $data["foo"]=$item->bar;
       }
       $this->do_something_with_transformed_data_array($data);
   }
}

I was mystified by the behavior of the script -- eventually it dawned on 
me that I wasn't initializing the $data array with each loop...  I 
wanted $data["foo"] to be undefined if $item->bar evaluates false,  
however,  the value of "foo" was persisting between iterations,  causing 
do_something_with_transformed_data_array to behave horribly wrong...

    In some languages (C#,  for instance),  variables declared at a 
point in a loop come into existence at that point in the loop,  and 
don't have any life from one iteration to the next -- that kind of 
scoping certainly makes this kind of error less likely (unless $data was 
defined in front of the loop.)

    What I find interesting is that I don't remember ever making this 
sort of mistake in the past...

Coding with notices on would make that an easy catch.

...that you know of. ;-)

There is function scope in php, but not loop scope.

Tedd,

I just wanted to thank you again for calling my attention to the page above.

Today I needed to create a drop down list that would filter the display
of records based on a series of date ranges (expired, 1-30 days, 30-45
days, etc.) With the help of your link & my MySQL reference book--and
after some trial & error with syntax--I was able to use the DATEDIFF and
CURDATE functions in my queries to retrieve exactly the results I
needed. Well, almost--I'm still trying to figure out how to get only
items that are expired or have no expiration date set, but I have no
doubt I'll eventually work it out. In any event, I can see that this
method is wayyyyy better than whatever convoluted process I would have
come up with had you not nudged me in the right direction.

As soon as I figure that last bit out, I'm going to go back and see if I
can also some of the functions to improve the other code that I
initially posted. Even the smallest breakthrough feels like a huge
victory to me, so... Woohoo! *happy dance*

Bev :)

We have suddenly started having issues with one of our servers with a
local hosting company. We have never had any issues at all for the 6-7
years we've used their servers (we have a total of 5-6). Anyway, this
one server went down last week, and tech support said:

"Your VPS has been either hacked or an insecure script has been used
to upload stuff. We have tar'ed up the data was being used
(/tmp/b.tar.gz) You need to have your developer take a look at your
sites code to determine any vulnerabilities"

To which I responded, "ok, assume that we believe all of our scripts
are secure. in looking at the logs, how do i pinpoint that someone
is/was trying to upload something?"

Tech support was less than helpful after that. So I pose the question
to the list. How do I pinpoint the issue? There are about five domains
running on the site, and we did not have any issues until we upgraded
a ZenCart install for one of the sites.

I'd have a look at the owner and timestamps on the naughty files.  Are  
they owned by the web server user?  If so, check server logs in the  
period leading up to the file modification times.

If they're owned by some other user, make sure that user account is  
secure.

I've seen plenty of instances where someone thinks "it must be an  
insecure script", but it turned out that some user on the box had a  
bone-headed, easily brute-forced password.

They tar'd up the data from where? It might help you to know what
directory it was uploaded to. Although a clever rootkit would cover
its tracks, a clever kit wouldn't take down your server.

But really, the problem could be anywhere in the system. Was the OS up
to date? Latest version of PHP? Anything hand-compiled that hadn't
been updated in a long time? Are there FTP accounts (unencrypted)?
Anyone lazy about their passwords?

There are a lot of ways for a box to get hacked. But as Tim just
pointed out, it's usually something simple and obvious, like
connecting to FTP from Starbucks or emailing a password from an
internet cafe while on vacation.

Well the problem there is that they've all been removed from the
server. And I deleted the local copy.

Yeah, they seem to be short on that detail, even though I posed the question.

I am fairly certain which domain it was. It's the one with an old
version of CakePHP that we inherited.

Heh. You mean the version you can't upgrade because it would break everything?

Maybe it's time to see if you can put a Web Application Firewall in
front of the box or install mod_security or something along those
lines.

The answer to your original question (pinpointing the upload) is to
grep through the Apache logs for suspicious POSTs. Sounds like a lot
of fun if you don't have any idea when it happened.

Good thought.

That's what I was thinking actually. There has to be something
*somewhere* that would give me an indication of where the issue lies.

Finding the source of a break-in like this can be notoriously difficult. 
Much better to wipe the drive and reinstall using the latest OS and 
software that can run your app (because you have no idea if any system 
binaries have been replaced with trojans).

If the breakin is through an OS vulnerability then keeping it up to date 
will help. Obviously, if it happens again with a up-to-date OS, then its 
possible its a vulnerability in PHP and/or your application code (in which 
case looking at POST requests in logs might help).

I once had an old server that had an IRC process running disguised as a 
regular Apache process. I only figured it out by observing open port 
numbers using netstat and finding the process with lsof. In the end I 
narrowed the problem down to an old component in a Joomla install that 
had a known vulnerability - updating that component fixed the problem.

But servers are constantly fending off brute-force ssh attacks (denyhosts 
is your friend for that kind of crap). These days I switch off all 
unnecessary services and make sure needed services are not exposed to the 
outside (MySQL listening on localhost, Postfix too is its just used for 
sending out, etc). On many systems this might been running a firewall 
with a very locked down configuration (protocol tracking is also my 
friend).

Speaking of firewall lock down, I'm a big fan of the iptables
configurations that deny access to ALL ports that aren't explicitly
allowed, which for a vanilla web server would be 443/80 and 22 for ssh
(and if you're crazy deny access to 22 save for an IP-based whitelist,
I use a dyndns entry and re-resolve it every 15 minutes, so I can get
in wherever, but I'm the only person to ever have ssh access to the
server).  I'd make sure password authentication is off for ssh as well
and only use keyfile auth, as it's inherently more secure and less
prone to attack.  If you set your firewall up this way, you're pretty
much guaranteed that an exploit is in your webapp, as webservers and
openssh are very rarely open to exploits.

They must have some evidence indicating a problem exists.  They need to 
tell you what that evidence is.  Then you'll have a direction to go in.

Yes, that's much like what I do these days. Not only what's coming in, but 
also strict iptable rules on what's allowed to open a connection *from* 
the host too.

That's not always the case: they could have seen something as simple as a 
sudden increase in load or number of connections coming in/out of the 
machine, or just a boatload of port 25 traffic.

One thing I haven't seen is too much help with finding tools that make
problems like this scarce if not non-existant...

I've been using an application called Atomic Secured Linux - it just works
and the team behind it makes updates to the rules constantly

but it's not just mod-sec rules - it also has some things to help you
enforce good password policy

Does anyone have any good naming conventions for mysql databases and tables and columns?  I'm developing a complex lamp project now, and my normal convention doesn't seem to want to work too well for this project - there are a few conflicts.

In my experience, the most important thing is consistency.  Almost  
everything else is a matter of taste.

For instance, some folks like to name columns with the table name as a  
prefix on every column (except foreign keys):

create table a(
	a_id int,
	a_value varchar(64),
	a_created datetime
);

create table b (
	b_id int,
	a_id int references a.a_id
	b_value varchar(128),
	b_created datetime
);

This is a smart thing to do as every column, across all tables, has a  
unique name (unless it's a foreign key)

However, it can create a lot of typing, which can be annoying.

On the other hand, you can be more concise:

create table a(
	id int,
	value varchar(64)
	created datetime
);

create table b(
	id int,
	value varchar(64),
	created datetime
);

This saves some typing, but can create annoying ambiguity.  Join  
operations end up requiring more specific selection critera (SELECT  
a.title as a_title, b.title as b_title).

I used to use the former method almost exclusively.  However, as I  
started playing with various frameworks, I've switched to the latter  
as those I've worked with kind of expect it.  Probably because various  
_call() based magic ends up looking nicer in userland code.

If you have more specific considerations, feel free to get more  
specific.

-Tim

Hi Tim,

Actually, you probably just covered about 99% of what I've read today, 
which is both a good and a bad thing - first, it's good because I know 
that information is out dated, but bad because I still have a few 
questions!  But I'll try to clear my questions up.

I've always used the second method you recommend.  It works well for a 
schema like this:

CREATE TABLE `country` (
   `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

CREATE TABLE `state` (
   `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `county_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
   `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

CREATE TABLE `city` (
   `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `state_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
   `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

each city has a state_id, and each state, has a country_id.  And since 
cities, states, and countries all are sort of self explanatory, the schema 
sort of documents itself.  But what if you're developing a billing system? 
That's where it's hard, because things are different:

For instance:

CREATE TABLE `account` (
   `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `type_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
   `companyName` varchar(25) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

CREATE TABLE `account_type` (
   `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `type` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

CREATE TABLE `customer` (
   `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `account_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
   `firstname` varchar(25) NOT NULL,
   `lastname` varchar(25) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

As you can see, each customer as an account_id.  But each account also has 
type_id.  I chose to do this like I did above, but why didn't I call the 
tables:

customer
customer_account
customer_account_type

After all, that would have worked the same way, right?  So I never really 
know where to put the top level.  Is it just up to the person?  My guess 
is, does it just only matter if the table names aren't self explanatory? 
For instance, if I just had a table called "type", that isn't really 
verbose, which is why I put account_ in front of it.

Also, as you can see, I only tend to use underscores when I'm referencing 
a column in another table.  type_id for instance is account_type.id. 
Which is why I did "firstname" or "companyName" (I did this on purpose to 
show two possibilities).  Which one is the better one to use? 
first_name/last_name/company_name or firstName, lastName, companyName? 
The problem is, if I use first_name, but I'm also using type_id, then some 
people might think that first_name references a column in the first (or a 
similarly named) table called "name".

Thanks for your help!

-Matt

For lookup tables like an "account type", I'd certainly call the table  
"account_type", and not just "type".  Eventually you'll have an "order  
type" to deal with, so ... yeah.

In the larger picture, you want to maintain enough specificity to keep  
things from getting confusing.  This is largely a function of the  
domain.  However, domains tend to grow, so it's better to err slightly  
on the side of verbose specificity.  For example, it's probably not a  
terrible idea to use "customer_account" instead of just "account", in  
case 12 months from now you need two new kinds of ".+_account"s

For column names, it's tempting to give a specific meaning to an  
underscore, like you do.

I tend to avoid that, as underscores can be really useful to keep  
things legible.  lowerCamelCase, to me, is just kind of ugly in myslql  
and other rdbmses where identifiers are case-insensitive.

If you really want, I suppose you could use a standard where a double  
underscore indicates some foreign key: account__id REFERENCES account.id

Matt,

This is how I originally learned it way back when and still believe.
SQL should read almost like english.

Tables are named in the plural.
Columns are singular.
id columns are the table name singular "_id".

For example.

create table users (
	user_id int auto_increment not null,
	username varchar(20)
	);


I have used simple id columns which works fine too but using the  
table_id concept can make things easier down the road.

Perhaps explaining what your current method is might make it easier  
for us to suggest a solution.

Hope it Helps.

But account is the "top level".  Every customer has an account.  Every 
account has a type.  So really, the top level is account type, because 
that's the only table out of the three that has no "parent" of it's own. 
But why would I create a customer and a customer_account table?  Sure, 
each customer has one and only one account, so it makes sense, just like 
each account has one and only one type.   But:

account -> account type
customer -> account

aren't the same "sort of relationship" to me, even though they are both 
many to one relationships.  Tying the account table to customer at this 
point (customer_account) would be bad, because every service in the 
"service" table has one and only one account as well - so why wouldn't we 
call it service_account and service?  The same sort of thing.  So at that 
point, I would probably do:

account
account_type
customer
service
service_definition
service_type
invoice
invoice_type

but at that point, there really is no standard.  I sort of just picked 
"meaningful" top level tables.

Bah, it's all confusing to me :) I guess there really is no way to do it. 
If there are 10 levels of one:many relationships, you can't underscore 
them all out.

one
one_two
one_two_three
one_two_three_four

would get quite confusing ;)

OK.

So you would do something like:

first_name
account_id
last_name
service_definition_id

Stuff like that?  Even though first_name is just a field (and last_name), 
while account_id is the id column in the account table and 
service_definition_id is the id column in the service_definition table?

And if you did the latter, would you do:

service_definition__id at that point?  or service__definition__id?

Thanks!

Matt,

	It is really hard to talk about tables without understanding the data  
needs. If you want to come up with an example of what you need to do  
we could all suggest structures. I don't really get the levels concept  
of a relational db, but what do I know :)

	Part of good db design is to plan way into the future. Your customers  
may only have one account now, but is it possible in the future they  
could have 2? These are HUGE decisions that can come back with really  
big teeth.

	What is a service?

	Russ

Well, this is all in an example.  Even if a customer could have more than 
one accounts, allowing for a many:many, I'd still have the same issue 
figuring out naming schemes.

"Email Hosting", "Web Hosting", etc.  But I'm not designing a billing 
system.  This is just an example.  But I'd have these same questions if I 
was listing something else, like a forum, etc.

Well a customer to account would be a one to many.

customers
	customer_id
	name
	....

accounts
	account_id
	name
	customer_id
	...

services
	service_id
	name
	...

account_services
	account_service_id
	account_id
	service_id
	start_date
	end_date
	...

So you have a one to many customers to accounts relation. You have a  
one to many accounts to account_services and a one to many services to  
account_services.

Not sure if I am helping :/

Good luck

What's wrong with that?  I think you've got it right -- it all comes

True.  I don't think a hard and fast rule is appropriate here.

That's pretty much what I'd actually do in practice.  In every case I  
can think of, the trailing "_id" is enough to indicate that this is a  
foreign key.

Right.  Like I said, the underscore doesn't have any special semantic  
meaning, unless the following two characters are an "i" and then a "d"

Were I doing things that way, I'd do the former.

But it's just a thought.  I've never done things that way, and it  
seems confusing -- the visual difference between _ and __ is too small.

Right, although there, I'd probably do it a different way, where services 
would be the listing of service  and service_definition would be the 
definitions of services.  That way, each record in "service" would have 
definition_id which would map to service_definition.id.

Agreed.

OK, thanks!  Turns out, I've sort of been doing things this way all along, 
minus the _ issue.  Thanks for your input!

I think the definition would be in the services table.
The entity is a service, hosting or something. The columns in services  
should define the entity (serivce).
So the service_id in account_services ties back to what the service is.

If that was the case, they wouldn't have known which files to "tar up". 
Depending on how they were tar'd you should be able to see the path by 
querying the index of the tar file.

Not to re-iterate what Chris was saying, but, you need information in 
order to take appropriate action.
All things considered there are at least several thousand potential root 
causes to your issue, unless you have some direction and cooperation 
from the hosting provider.

Attached is a basic template/list I rundown with clients (I do a lot of 
security on the side, and at work too. :P ) who experience similar 
issues, I have had these be well over 30 pages, as some clients really 
have no idea how many entities are touching their systems. I don't want 
it to appear overwhelming or impossible to successfully discover the 
root-cause of your particular incident; but unless you can get 
root-level log/AAA access, or some serious cooperation from the hosting 
company, you're likely not going to be able to cover all the bases.

P.S. Don't pay for ASL, you can build it yourself, just do a little 
googlin' :o)

I must have missed that.  Sorry for the repost.

So you would recommend using tablename_ in the beginning of every field in 
a table?

I assumed they tar'ed up the web application and logs. Hardly a

Exactly!

While that is a good warning, it shouldn't be a reason to shy away from 
clearly named tables and columns. I think it is better to type a bit more than 
keep guessing that column drvtsn is for driver_trip_sheet_number. Depending on 
which tool is used to craft the queries you may have intellisense and the 
typing is less of an issue after a while.

Keep in mind that there is a chance that someone other than yourself has to 
deal with the tables and code later. And even you will be happier when you 
don't have to permanently guess half a year from now. I think it is better to 
deal with the annoyance of typing than with the annoyance of ambiguitiy. A 
mistyped column name will make your query fail, ambiguity will possibly not 
while being still wrong.

Other than that, Tim covered it all.

No.

I see what you are saying, but "customer" is as different as 
"account" is to "account_type". They are all different things. Why 
confuse the matter by adding a customer prefix? There is no need.

Plus, if you're going to be consistent with that "mistake", then your 
naming should be:

customer_customer
customer_account
customer_account_type

Do you see what I mean? That practice doesn't provide any clarity -- 
it only confuses things.

One additional consideration, which was discussed last week, was not 
entitling the index of all tables as "id", but rather adding the 
table name to the id, such as:

customer_id
account_id
account_type_id

That makes sense to me because when you're dealing with a bunch of 
tables, a variable named "id" might be used incorrectly OR 
overwritten.

For example, using:

SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer_id = '$customer_id'

is just as easy to read as:

SELECT * FROM customer WHERE id = '$id'

But later in the code, after reading many different tables, what 
table does "$id" relate to? It's not clear is it? But there is no 
confusion with $customer_id is there?

I disagree.  I wasn't trying to create "customer" as a prefix.  I was 
simply renaming the tables based on the one:many relationships I have 
inside the tables.

account
account_type
customer

since customer stores an account_id, and account stores an account_type 
id, I could have picked customer to be the main level table, and just 
references out from there:

customer.account_id -> account.id ->
 	account.type_id -> account_type.id
 		-> ..... ->...
 			-> ...... -> ...

Really inefficient, but it was another method of "standardizing" (which to 
me, gives no clarity, because as I've explained in one of my other emails, 
starting at one top level will make things confusing.  And then what 
happens if some new table references customer.id as customer_id?  like an 
emails table?  Then I'm really confused:

email
email_customer
email_customer_account
email_customer_account_type

I know this is messed up, but it was my thinking for a while as I tried to 
create a "Perfect" relational standard.  And I had no many to many 
relationships at that point, so it was really easy to do, but very 
ineffective.

This is what I've usually done in the past.

Main level table?

I think that's one of the problems. There is no main level table -- 
there are just tables. It should not make any difference if you are 
addressing customers, accounts, account_types, emails, or whatever. 
They are nothing more than data and each has there own relationships.

Also, I think I see another problem. The account table holds the 
account_type, right?

If so, then your customer table should only contain the account_id, 
but NOT the account_type_id -- that's redundant.

To access what account-type the customer has means you pull the 
account_id from the customer table -- then look up that account 
(using the account_id ) in the account table -- then pull the 
account_type_id and then find the account-type via it's id 
(account_type_id) from the account type table. Understand.

customer: account_id
account: account_type_id
account_type: type

In any event, that's the way I would do it.

Cheers,

tedd

You could have a table account_type which has primary key 
account_type_id, and a table account which has primary key account_id 
and then a lookup field in account which holds the relevant 
account_type_id...

That way in table customer you just need a lookup field on account_id 
because there is already a relationship in place to find the type of 
account based on that value...I think that's what Tedd just said in 
essence as well.

Although this structure is certainly presupposing that each customer 
has only one account.

Right.  I want to do it that way on purpose. Because where I tie the accounts together is by login id. But most of the time the customer information changes per account even if its the same person.

Tedd,

There are always top level tables in your schema, at least in my opinion. For instance, reference tables that do key -> value pairs tend to not be "root" level tables in a schema. Just my opinion. 

Also, I never said account_type would be stored inside the customer table. If you meant my reference to customer_account_type, that was just a naming scheme for a table only, which I was referring to as inefficient but would be a natural progression if I was to be obsessive about always documenting table relationships inside the table names. 

Based on the feedback I have gotten in this thread, the way I have done things in the past is okay, except ill now be adding underscores to column names for more than just foreign key identifiers. 

Thanks all!

Login ID is a field inside customer and can be set multiple times per customer record.

OK.  Is login_id equivalent to customer_id, or is it generated anew 
upon each login and then associated with  a customer profile?  Does 
each customer have only 1 account?

If each customer can have more than 1 login ID, then normalization 
dictates a separate table, let's call it login , with fields

login_id
customer_id
login_time
login_IP
session_id

or whatever you store related to Logins, i.e. one row for each time the 
customer logs in, with their permanent customer_id and the assigned 
login_id for that session.

Each time they login, the table generates a new row, with a new 
login_id, and associates it with their customer_id.

So you can then do a query and find ALL the times each customer logged 
in.

Unless you're overwriting the login_id in the customer table each time, 
and not storing the historical data...but usually that would not be the 
case.

But that would also allow multiple logins for the same customer, which I don't. Its a one to many only. So it doesn't need a separate table.

I'm not clear on this...  You just told me that you had multiple logins 
for each customer in the customer table.  Right?  I.e. each time they 
log in, they get a new login_id.

No. Not true. They can create a Login and map it to multiple customer records. However there can only be one account per customer.

I'm not clear on this...  You just told me that you had multiple logins 
for each customer in the customer table.  Right?  I.e. each time they 
log in, they get a new login_id.

Hmm, OK.  So therefore it is not the customer logging in, but some sort 
of account rep overseeing multiple customer accounts...?
If that's true, the the customer_id and login_id have only a peripheral 
relationship, and there would also be an accountmanager_id or some such.

Love this stuff.

No. It is the customer logging in, but a customer record can't have more than one account. 

I actually renamed the customer table to contact in my example to make it more clear. Yes, data can be repeated, but hardly ever.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Database, table, and column naming schemes
Message-ID: <1252896354.21034@coral.he.net>

If the customer is the one logging in, and the customer can have only 
one account, it's not theoretically possible for a login to be 
associated with more than one customer, then.

So I'm back to my original suggestion for a login table.  Each time the 
customer logs in, generate a row in that table.  That way you can 
preserve the login history and you'd have to have that table, anyway, 
to generate the login_ids.

> No. It is the customer logging in, but a customer record can't have 
more than one account.

It is the contact (not customer, I renamed the table) logging in, but perhaps for two different entities. 

Here is an example. There is a guy named tom who has a personal webhosting account and a business account for his business. His email addresses are different. So are his names!  For his personal account, he uses tom Jones. For his work account, he uses Thomas Jones II. So everything is different, but he is the same person and wants to maintain both accounts with the same username.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Database, table, and column naming schemes
Message-ID: <1252897065.23932@coral.he.net>

You stated previously that each customer/contact cannot have more than 
1 account.  But, it appears from the below that you need a "contact 
name" and then multiple "account names" under it(i.e. business name, 
personal account name) associated with the one contact/customer ID -- 
since they do in some cases have more than 1 account.  


So the contact logs on, that goes in the login table with the 
contact_id creating a new row, and then the contact_id jas a 
relationship with all existing accounts for that contact.  But you'd 
still need to historically track the logons for each contact.

Kristina

> It is the contact (not customer, I renamed the table) logging in, but 
perhaps for two different entities. 
> 
> Here is an example. There is a guy named tom who has a personal 
webhosting account and a business account for his business. His email 
addresses are different. So are his names!  For his personal account, 
he uses tom Jones. For his work account, he uses Thomas Jones II. So 
everything is different, but he is the same person and wants to 
maintain both accounts with the same username.

We are on two separate pages. There is no tracking of login ID's. And nothing is automatically created. Login ID is a username. 

t1.login_id = t2.I'd

Hi Folks,

This is an interesting thread, but hard to follow with all the 
top-posting.  AFAIK it's not strictly prohibited on this list, but it 
does make it hard for others to follow the conversation.

Thanks,
Allen

Yeah, my apologies.  I usually dont top post, except all my replies 
yesterday were from my Blackberry.  I forgot that the blackberry does top 
posting only.  My apologies.

Someone needs to send me a whitepaper on acceptable vs. inacceptable 
posting.  Is this the way you want me to do it, underneath everything 
else?

No kidding! I'm just now catching up with the lists after spending the
better part of last weekend wrestling with a bunch of tables in exactly
this type of situation, so it's really fresh in my mind.

Both Kristina's & Daniel's advice on field names in the previous thread
made perfect sense once I got my tables properly normalized and needed
to join data from columns in each of them in order to display a "master"
(HTML) table of items.

Message-ID: <a9caffe50909181223i6b8bff6cne5817f2cee3e6305@mail.gmail.com>

I have asked tech support at the hosting company to enable the php_zip
extension for me. The person I am dealing with has told me that PHP
has to be recompiled for this, because of what this page says:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/zip.installation.php

Now I am by no means a server expert, but I enabled this same
extension yesterday on our development box by simply un-commenting it
in the php.ini file, stopping and restarting the server.

Am I missing something here?

Means the PHP on your dev box has all extensions already compiled and 
installed so you can selectively add/remove them by simply editing your 
php.ini.

OK, that makes sense. However, I have had tech support enable
extensions on this same server in the past and there has been no
mention of needing to recompile.

Would phpinfo() show what extensions that PHP binary was compiled with?

The configure command  (one of the first things phpinfo shows you :P)
should give you all that information.

If your still running php4, it seems like it does in fact need to be  
compiled in to php.

However, assuming your host is running php >=5.2.0 they can install it  
as a shared library via pecl:

# pecl install zip

Just did this, and manually added extension=zip.so to my php.ini on my  
macbook pro.

I'm running my own custom-compiled PHP (I like to build my AMP stacks  
from source) on this machine, but that shouldn't make a difference.

Remember Joomla is a CMS not a framework. I've personally only ever used
CodeIgniter and Cake. Both were fine though Cake was a bit stifling with the
naming conventions. Documentation was good though and that made things
easier. I'm going to try Zend for my next project because I like the idea of
being able to use their classes on a needs-only basis. It seems more
flexible and more enterprise ready. At least that's the vibe I get.

Message-ID: <A5297893-59EB-4FCF-8BAC-8077EFA51EC8@gmail.com>

I've been using simplexml to parse XML and so far the XML I've had to  
deal with has been pretty straight forward. Then I run across this XML  
which I don't know what to call it or how it should be handled properly.

Here is a fragment of what I'm talking about:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<document type="db download">

<packages total_weight="15.8" total_packages="1">
<package length="147" width="5" height="5" weight="15.8"/>
</packages>

I was expecting each attribute and node to have it's own <> and </>,  
and the data not to be surround by double-quotes or am I missing  
something?

Thanks!

That's valid. it's just using short hand attributes instead of nested nodes.

I'm not an xml expert but I believe that's valid. Things within the
brackets (and not in their own node I believe are considered
attributes.

I am not an XML expert, but yes, I would too expect opening and closing tags 
for everything, be it as <some_tag..../> or as <some_tag><some_tag/>. I don't 
see anything wrong with the quotes and think they have to be there.

Message-ID: <721f1cc50909190925m1205e214pd332a9937d6a7b78@mail.gmail.com>

I have been using Dreamhost because it's cheap and provides what I need and
has a really weird and funny newsletter.

However, if you need a custom php.ini, the instructions are found at
http://www.wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/PHP.ini with a great big disclamer
to the effect that if it suddenly breaks, you're on your own. Sure enough,
my little php app suddenly broke. Tore my hair out for a while, then finally
worked around.

Is the ability to customize your php.ini asking too much of a low-end
shared-hosting provider?

XML attributes must be quoted, but you can use either double or single
quotes. If there's nothing between the opening & closing tags you can
use the shorthand tag, just as you would with <img src="foo.gif" /> or
<br />.

Kristina,

While we're on this subject, I thought I would ask another pending 
question I have related to this.

I need to store a bunch (and by a bunch, I mean about 30-40) binary 
true/false values in my database.

In the past, I would do something like this:

CREATE TABLE........... (
 				is_active tinyint(1) default 1,
 				is_friend tinyint(1) default 1,
 				is_something tinyint(1) default 1,
 				is_something_else tinyint(1) default 1,
 				......
 			);

But that table would really get large if I had 30-40 extra columns in it. 
The other option was that I was considering a bit string:


CREATE TABLE......... (
 				permissions mediumint(11) default 0
);

INSERT INTO permissions (permissions) values (7);

Since there are 3 bits that make up the integer "8" (or 0 - 7):

1,2,4

This would mean that I could store 3 combinations of permissions, but it 
would be an integer.

This could get even more complex if I had 30-40, as I could do a really 
large hex string, or just store the actual bit string:


aef214  <--- one value
11000110111011 <-- or something like that


Thoughts?

-Matt

I have had the exact same experience. When you say "worked around," do 
you mean that you couldn't solve the problem? What happened to me was 
that they changed something which meant that the default path to mail 
was no longer good, so I couldn't send mail; but when I finally figured 
that out, I fixed it by setting the path and the issue was over.

uhh, but in fact they did provide that for you (and me), no? They just 
don't provide any support for it.

So if the above is valid XML, is there a specific name for this  
approach? Is there a benefit for doing it this way instead of nested  
nodes? Might this be considered older method?
Thanks,

There are different ways to access elements and attributes of XML documents
with SimpleXML (XPath, etc), but generally speaking, attributes can be
accessed as associative array values.

Here's an example:

<?php

$xml = <<<XML
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<document type="db download">
  <packages total_weight="15.8" total_packages="1">
    <package length="147" width="5" height="5" weight="15.8"/>
  </packages>
</document>
XML;

$sxml = new SimpleXMLElement($xml);

// Access the first package
$package = $sxml->packages->package[0];
echo sprintf(
    "Package Dimensions: %sx%sx%s Weight: %s\n",
    $package['length'],
    $package['width'],
    $package['height'],
    $package['weight']
);

// Find all packages
foreach($sxml->packages->package as $package) {
    echo sprintf(
        "Package Dimensions: %sx%sx%s Weight: %s\n",
        $package['length'],
        $package['width'],
        $package['height'],
        $package['weight']
    );
}

No, it's not an older method. There is no absolute definition of when to use
elements versus attributes. There are, however, some attempts at defining
general principles:

Hi Matt, 
Thanks for your question.  AFAIK, the above is still the way it's done 
most of the time.  From what you write below, it seems that you are 
trying to optimize the potential size of the database by being very 
parsimonious about the size and quantity of the fields.

>>The other option was that I was considering a bit string:


>>CREATE TABLE......... (
>>                   permissions mediumint(11) default 0
>>);

>>INSERT INTO permissions (permissions) values (7);

>>Since there are 3 bits that make up the integer "8" (or 0 - 7):

>>1,2,4

>>This would mean that I could store 3 combinations of permissions, but 
it 
would be an integer.

>>This could get even more complex if I had 30-40, as I could do a 
really 
large hex string, or just store the actual bit string:

>>aef214  <--- one value
>>11000110111011 <-- or something like that

Here you are facing an issue between readability/ease of retrieval and 
space needed to store.  I think that the idea of using a string of 0's 
and 1's in one field is interesting & useful, and is readable enough so 
that if something is awry you'd be able to find it fast.  Some string-
handling functions to pull out individual values & update the field as 
needed, and you're rolling.

I'd suspect that in a very large database, by using one field of an 
appropriate size to store a string of 40 booleans, rather than 40 
tinyint fields, you could save some really appreciable room.

The thing is that attributes have less overhead. So if you have many different 
elements that have a few properties using attributes shaves off a few 
characters. Then again, XML has a gigantic amount of overhead anyway, so why 
bother. One could also say that anything mandatory is to be an attribute while 
everything else is a sub-element. Haven't looked at the IBM page yet, so maybe 
my ideas are not on the money. In general, XML is made for machines to read, 
it is not fit for human consumption.

That's not well-formed (valid) because there should be a closing 
</document> tag at the end.

As others have mentioned, XML has "elements" (the stuff using <> and </>) 
and "attributes" (the stuff inside the opening or empty element that use 
the name="value" format).

Cool :) Thanks!  I also think it will save not only space, but vertical 
size too.  A bunch of is_* columns can just get overwhelming.

Thanks for the link and the code example, Mark. I certainly learned  
something here and realize my XML existence has been somewhat sheltered.

In the absence of no absolute definition, I propose we refer to the  
more common XML expected as "The Popular XML" version. :-)

I guess if approach XML as a programming language, then there are many  
methods to make use of it. I've thought of XML as I do HTML as being a  
format and not a programming language. I had a similar discussion  
years ago when someone argued that nroff was a language because it  
could do loops.

Within a particular subdir of the site, I wanted to auto_prepend a file
containing authentication logic, set my include_path to point to my personal
library, etc. I ended up sticking the path to my libs in $_SERVER via SetEnv
in a .htaccess so it wouldn't have to be hard-coded but once. Then I
manually edited the few files to require() my auth.php, rather than
auto_prepend it.

I would have cheerfully used "php_value foo bar" in my .htaccess for all my
initialization needs, but that technique evidently doesn't work when php is
in cgi mode.

I am having a polite little argument about that with them. I said, in

they said we'll get back to you.

A Simple Shell Script to Create a Custom php.ini on Dreamhost?s Shared Host
http://www.foryourlungsonly.net/2009/07/28/a-simple-shell-script-to-create-a-custom-php-ini-on-dreamhosts-shared-host/

PS, in 2000 we paid $25,000 every 4 weeks to host our site.  I mean have to
give these guys a little bit of leeway, the prices are rock bottom.

If you have a serious site, you need to get a dedicated server.  I think the
issue with dreamhost, is no live support.  I think that's a MAJOR problem.
I'm surprised a company that brings in millions of dollars a month has not
tackled that.

Hostgator is fine by us, we have 100's of sites hosted there. ZERO problems.
Online support in 30 seconds or less.  Hard to top that.  :-)

That looks familiar -- I've seen it. It does essentially the same thing the

@everyone else, thanks for the suggestions. Vserver indeed! really not all
that much more expensive than shared, is it. And linode.com looks like so
much fun, my mouth waters! (b/c my experience is limited to shared hosting
and a managing couple of in-house (internal) LAMP servers at work, and this
looks like the Real World)

Dreamhost got back to be and essentially said, FY, albeit politely.

Awhile ago I compared some of the vserver hosting providers and linode.com 
comes out on top (max bang for buck).

You can also build clusters with added private IPs - nodes can be in the 
same data center or you can ask to have them spun up in another of their 
data centers (currently, I think its CA, TX and NJ). Traffic between nodes 
using private IPs in the same data center doesn't count towards your 
(pretty generous) monthly bandwidth allowance.

I'm posting this for a friend. She does some teaching for Systems

Does anyone know of a good top-level overview, geared toward systems 
engineers, of the Service-Oriented Architecture concept? (I.e. geared 
toward INCOSE-type SEs, not Microsoft-type SEs).

The Wikipedia entry isn't bad, but I'd love to have a concise 2-page 
discussion I can give out to my students. Unfortunately, most 
discussions, however much they try to be overviews, tend to aim for the 
web guru...things like "idempotent" "stateful service", "registry", 
"partition your usage scenarios", (even "maximizes business agility") 
make it difficult to read the overview if you don't already know what 
you are talking about, and I'm looking for an overview specifically for 
people who don't know what it means. I want them to start seeing how 
what they do does and does not already use SOA concepts, so they have to 
know what those concepts are without actually doing software development 
for the web.

Ok, if that does not cook it, think METAPHORS, based on HUMAN BEHAVIOR.
Don't have any handy at the moment, but that will do the trick.  Humans can
respond to something based on a metaphor 100X better then some techno BS.

Hello,

   Just wanted to throw in another suggestion of using Rackspace Cloud
   (http://www.rackspacecloud.com/); specifically their Cloud Servers
   offering.

   That is, if you are looking for something more flexible. I think pricing
   wise it's not bad at all given some extra benefits you can gain
   using their 'platform'.

   You can also use their API to interact with cloud server(s):
   http://github.com/AlekseyKorzun/php-cloudservers ;)

    I still like the stability of just plain ordinary dedicated hosts.  
You just need one site that pulls in $250 a month to pay for hosting for 
a hundred smaller sites.  You can install the PHP and other software you 
want (right now I have a PHP 5.2 and a PHP 5.3 server running side by 
side),  and not deal with the weirdnesses that tend to exist with 
virtual servers:  for instance,  I used to be on a virtual server that 
did something strange that wouldn't let you compile GNU emacs.

    Six months ago I was running big batch jobs that took three days to 
run.  I was thinking about going to Amazon EC2,  Map/Reduce and all 
that.  Then I thought through the problem again,  compressed my data 
structures,  put all of the random-access stuff into RAM and found my 
three day jobs became 20 minute jobs.

    When my data set gets 100x bigger (maybe in 2012) I'll need to think 
about cloud computing again.

Joomla 1.5 is actually a framework and three apps built with that
framework - the installer, the frontend, and backend.

I used the framework to build the quizilla website for MTV, and only
used what I needed - as a glue framework should be - and skipped
dynamic navigation, timezone support, internationalization, and a
bunch more.

You should read the book. It will help you understand the frameworks,
how they work, and how to code them.
That said, all of the most popular frameworks add a fairly significant
amount of overhead. If you need to create a high performance site, be
prepared to jump into caching so the framework doesn't load on every
page hit.
Here is a kind of old report on benchmarking some frameworks to create
"Hello World".
http://avnetlabs.com/php/php-framework-comparison-benchmarks

While you won't be creating a "Hello World" web page, an Ajax call
would have similar processing requirements (not a lot of data, simple
request). You should now how to create simple pages outside of any
framework, for those simple solutions.

Hi all,

In sitting down to hack an ancient, bizarrely-indented Perl open-source 
project just now, I shot it through Perltidy, and was downright excited 
at the fact that the code is now somewhat comprehensible.

I remember having looked around for similar PHP projects, but nothing 
seemed fully-baked as Perltidy.  Anyone have a recommendation?

Many thanks,

There's source formatting (which is what I think you mean) built into
Zend Studio; while not free, it's the only thing I know of that does
this.

PDT for eclipse has the same feature. I'm not familiar with PerlTidy does it
do anything more than fix indentations, position curly brackets, etc.?

There is this link about Joomla Frameworks:
http://docs.joomla.org/How_to_create_a_stand-alone_application_using_the_Joomla!_Framework

Wasn't there a presentation about using the Joomla Frameworks, that  
might be online?

There's a PEAR package that does this:
http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Beautifier

I haven't used the current release, so can't vouch for it.

Perltidy deals with spacing, brackets, various and sundry code style 
issues, see http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/stylekey.html

The granularity of config options is one of the cooler things about it, 
IMO - you can set it up for your shop's coding style.

Not sure about any presentations, but you can look at the installer
app in the standard Joomla 1.5 download to see the simplest version of
a framework app.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Reading Dublin Core Nodes from Google Books XML
Message-ID: <a9caffe50909251106pfe78cfchcefa843ddda9499f@mail.gmail.com>

I am having a terrible time trying to read Dublin Core nodes from a
Google Books XML file. You can see the basic structure here:

http://code.google.com/apis/books/docs/gdata/developers_guide_protocol.html#SearchingForBooks

Here is the code that I am working with:

$address = "http://books.google.com/books/feeds/volumes?q=$q&as-isbn=$isbn";
$page = file_get_contents($address);
//
$xml = new SimpleXMLElement($page);
$item=$xml->entry[0];
$dc=$item->children("http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/");
echo $dc->creator;

The XML is read just fine, but when I get to the DC elements, I get
nothing. I am stumped.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Good DB abstraction layer
Message-ID: <5e2aaca40909292106h74a52358tc34fe1344a353bc0@mail.gmail.com>

I'm architecting the next-generation platform for web development at
my company.  I need to connect to a MSSQL Server for copying our data
feed, and use PostgreSQL and MySQL locally.  I'm looking at Symfony
for application development and Drupal for Content Management plus
functionality that fits well with the Drupal way.  So, I expect that
for the foreseeable future, I'll have a mixed DB environment.

I see that Symfony uses PDO [1], which in turn has drivers for
PostgreSQL and MySQL but the driver for MSSQL is marked
'experimental'.

I'm wondering what approaches people have found successful and tips or
advice in this area (mixed DB environments including MSSQL).

For example, since I may also develop OpenOffice applications that
interact with the PostgreSQL database through an ODBC driver, I am
thinking using the PDO ODBC [2] driver to connect to MSSQL might also
be better than using the 'experimental' MSSQL driver.  I would like to
avoid using specific extensions if possible (i.e. MSSQL extensions to
PHP) since I'd like the code to be more cross-platform, simple, and
easy.

Thanks

Are you plannng to use the ORM layers in symfony? If you do, then you will 
have to use PDO.

BTW, FYI, Doctrine is destined to become the default ORM for symfony from 
1.3 onwards (1.3 alpha was released a few days ago so its a safe bet it 
will be released in the next few months). So you may want to look at using 
Doctrine for your project.

Not to hijack the thread, but whatever came of PDO?

I know there was that whole PDO-vs-MDB thang and then MDB2 and
whatever, and never bothered to keep up. Now I got no idea what
happened.

Can you explain or point to how to make PDT clean up / format the PHP
source?  I was actually trying to integrate PHP_beautifier into PDT
today because I wanted to clean the source.  I didn't see how to get
PDT to format source on it's own (except for formatting HTML
attributes and such) and actually it didn't do too well with
PHP_beautifier in the sense that I couldn't find a variable to
substitute the file that I'm editing (It works on the file selected in
the navigation pane).

It's been moved into the PHP core, is still actively developed and is
generally considered the future of database interaction in PHP.
