<PRE>Yuri,

that's just it, it's not a typical shopping cart, they want to have several store fronts that can sell items.  Multiple shops where a user can navigate and order products from more than one shop in one transaction.

They also want an admin area for each shop, the main admin interface limited by access, such as admin1 has access to part of the admin area and admin2 can have access to more parts of the admin area.  If it wasnt confidential i would forward the docs to the list so you could see all of the features.  

They want to be able to have a portal for the users so that they can have

They can see the weather
See the stock market
See front page news from local newspapers
Horoscopes
Match.com
The top boxoffice numbers

Search integration including not limited to

yahoo, google

such stuff as
-message board
-classifieds
-their profile
-newsletter 
-events
-Email to a Friend recommend us kind of thing and win points program.
-Discounts, shopping within the site's community members. So they can shop between themselves and have a community discount .

so as you can see it is much more than a typical shopping cart.

this project will probably take me upwards of 6-8 months

  For a shopping cart -- maybe a little. But you would know better..you met with them and could feel them out. But hey -- a deal is made when you have a willing seller and a willing buyer! Is the quote for a jewelry store?

    Guys i have put in a quote for a site similar to

    <A HREF="http://www.novica.com/">http://www.novica.com/</A>

    and the person said the quote was way too much, my quote was $25,000 for the entire site to be done that is tax free for them, meaning i am paying my own taxes.  Thier site included a ton of statistic features and quickbooks report integration etc...

    Do you guys think i quoted high or low?
