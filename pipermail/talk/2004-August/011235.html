<PRE>I would like to follow-up with my post last night and put this to rest. 
My post last night was insensitive. It was late and I did not take the 
time to make my response diplomatic. I purely stated what the guidelines 
are and where the community can go to review them.

My intention was to let the user know there is another list for this 
purpose and that there are guidelines that prompted my response. I try 
and make it a habit not to offer guidance unless I can offer a reference 
to back it up. I also try and not operate on pure opinion when offering 
that guidance.

As John stated, the guidelines I refereed to are relatively new. 
Normally, an off list mod is the way to go but I responded on list to 
raise the awareness of the guidelines. I did not state that he would be 
prohibited from posting after review. I just stated that posts that are 
commercial in nature should be reviewed by the board.

I am not trying to come off &quot;holier than thou&quot;; my intention was to 
raise awareness on two fronts, that's it. I agree with Chris that being 
an accessible resource does make the community stronger. In the same 
breath, it is the community member&#8217;s social responsibility to be aware 
of the community's guidelines. I hope we can close this discussion and 
move on. Please accept my apology for my lack of sensitivity. I do not 
intend to drive anyone away.

Respectfully,
Hans K

</I>&gt;<i>and I appreciate those who do. It makes our group stronger and more
