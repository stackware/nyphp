The fact that it is a recent rule doesn't excuse the misapplication of it.
Letting someone know that we have a jobs list is great, and that's all
that needs to be said.

Even PHP-General allows job postings, and it's the largest PHP mailing
list in the world.

Did you read the email? Seriously, I can't imagine that the &quot;commercial&quot;
bit in the charter was intended to address some growing problem with
people not knowing we have a separate jobs list. If this were an email
from someone using the list as an advertising platform, then I would agree
that it is a misuse of the list, and I also think the poster would know
that intuitively.

Anyway, sorry for being the bad guy, but I felt something needed to be
said. I perceived a bit of a &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude being projected
toward someone using us to locate PHP talent, and I don't want to be a
part of that. I *want* people to use NYPHP's resources to find PHP talent,
and I appreciate those who do. It makes our group stronger and more
valuable to the members and to the community.
