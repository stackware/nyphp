I always enjoy parsing (really). IMHO string manipulation is what made 
Professional Basic the success it was (PBDS, a loong time ago) and what 
sold me on PHP as a general-purpose scripting language and not just a 
way to access HTTP headers.

Tokenizing is always fun (strtok). file_get_contents is very handy for 
use with PHP string functions, especially tokenizing. I never cared much 
for &quot;exploding&quot; or &quot;splitting&quot;. Nothing like a deep, nested loops of 
str_stuff and preg_replace to get the brain cells working in the morning 
or in other words, to burn up your morning hours!)

Seriously though, with PHP I have found it is wise to try and use the 
built in parsers when possible, such as parse_url, but *never 
underestimate the amazing power of the preg_replace_callback*.

In your example, wouldn't preg_match(all) be a better choice than 
sscanf, so you can explicitly handle tabs and whitespace? That'd give 
you an array of all tagged content appearing in your file (in case there 
was more than the one you expected ;-) which you can further 
parse-n-store using str_&quot;stuff&quot; as you like?
