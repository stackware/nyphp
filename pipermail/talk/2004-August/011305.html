<PRE>Hello all,

I have an interesting problem which I&#185;m unable to solve on my own. I&#185;m
hoping someone here can offer some help. This is my first post to the list,
but I&#185;ve been lurking for a while and it seems that many brilliant and
generous minds post here.

Here&#185;s my problem:

I&#185;ve got a client with a tiny web site which I built for them. In it, I
included a contact form &#139; nothing fancy, just an HTML form to send mail() to
a specific address: <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">me at sphgrp.com</A>

The problem arose when I transferred the site from my server to theirs: they
have a shared web hosting plan provided by LunarPages.com with the domain
name sphgrp.com but they have their email accounts set up at Network
Solutions, Inc, also with the host name sphgrp.com.

This means that whenever PHP sends an email to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">me at sphgrp.com</A>, it never
leaves LunarPages&#185; network and instead of getting routed to the email
account at Network Solutions it gets routed to the main account webmail at
LunarPage&#185;s control panel! Not the intended effect at all.

I&#185;ve spent almost a day and a half on the phones with Tech Support from both
Network Solutions and LunarPages, and they have only succeeded in making me
more confused. On the one hand, one tech told me to change the PHP script.
On the other, another tech told me to get the IP address of the mail server
at Network Solutions and put that address as the MX record in LunarPage&#185;s
DNS entries for my domain name. Network Solutions, however, refuses to
provide that IP address for some reason.

My ultimate question, then, is how (if it&#185;s even possible) can I route mail
off LunarPage&#185;s network when its sent from PHP so that it is correctly
delivered to my client&#185;s inbox? Changing the domain name in one or both
instances is not a possibility, and I would very, very much like to avoid
telling the client that they need to transfer their mail account off their
current provider.

I haven&#185;t the DNS or PHP knowledge to figure this one out, and the tech
support people aren&#185;t supportive at all.

Thanks in advance for any and all help.

P.S. I usually get this list in a digest, but this is a time-sensitive
situation. I&#185;d be extremely grateful if a helpful reply could be CCed to
<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">maymaynyc at hotmail.com</A> directly so that I might catch it before the next
digest. Thanks again.
