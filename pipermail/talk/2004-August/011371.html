Hi Brian,

Well, I've been &quot;off-project&quot; for more than a year doing other things, 
so I can relate--however, I know a little bit about learning, so here's 
some advice that may help.

As you've mentioned above, you want to be involved in a project, 
primarily for the learning it provides, and one of the most effective 
ways is being involved in one that you are motivated to work on because 
you have a need.  The key here is a goal-oriented project rather than 
&quot;this might be nice to learn&quot; project.  For example, a friend of mine 
needed a testing application for his credentialling organization a 
couple years ago.  Of course, I looked for PHP/MySQL apps and discovered 
&quot;phpTest&quot;, and spent a fair amount of time customizing and adding a few 
enhancements.  I lucked out (learning-wise) since phpTest is very well 
written IMO, but needs some work to improve security, etc.  A hacker by 
the name of Brandon Tallent wrote it when he was 20 or so.  His stated 
goal was to make a test engine that was &quot;the first choice of anyone who 
needed to test any subject&quot;.  He said his second goal was to hack on and 
learn PHP and MySQL.
So much for the motivation aspect.

Now, as to projects, I am sometimes asked similar questions by my 
students and my first response is to work on something that you can be 
somewhat passionate and addicted to.  Sorta the &quot;one more thing before I 
go to bed&quot; project.  No one can tell you what that is.

If you're looking for *ideas* (NOT necessarily well-coded scripts) you 
can look here:
<A HREF="http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/index.html">http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/index.html</A>
(remember, this site has a bit of a rep for schlock code, so &quot;choose 
wisely&quot;)

another great fishing ground for ideas is here: (same caution as above)
<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/browse/160/">http://freshmeat.net/browse/160/</A>

and of course there's sourceforge:
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</A>

and you can get some ideas here:

hope that helps,
John
