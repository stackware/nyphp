<PRE>
&gt;<i> My apologies to Michael who posted the original job *advertisement*. I 
</I>&gt;<i> never doubted his intentions, but he has sparked the discussion so may 
</I>&gt;<i> feel a bit persecuted. He's also a self-proclaimed SEO person, so I 
</I>&gt;<i> expect he understands very well the value of such exposure.
</I>
I do understand that value. I also must point out though that I did not 
include a url at all to the business. I didn't even use my business 
email address. The only url I posted was in my usual sig and goes to my 
own personal website.

&gt;<i> Someone has to protect resources that are intended to be free, and 
</I>&gt;<i> intended to be high signal to noise, and NOT intended to be marketing 
</I>&gt;<i> vehicles for commercial enterprises (including book authors).
</I>
FYI, the company I work for doesn't spam mailing lists, wikis, or any of 
those bad practices you mentioned. I understand your concern about such 
abuse but I hardly think posting a job advert such as I did would fall 
into that category. We do take advantage of such resources to create 
sponsorship links to our clients but we do it in what I feel is the 
legit way - we either create the resource ourselves and put the links 
where appropiate or we make deals with the websites involved to pay them 
a sponsorship fee to include our text links on their pages. If it was my 
intention to get links from your site that is the method I would use. 
Again, I apologize for any trouble my job posting made.

Someone mentioned a list for non-technical discussion on these topics. 
What is the address for that list? Thanks.
