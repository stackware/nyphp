<PRE>Michael,

We have a job board where posts of this nature should be posted, 
<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs.">http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs.</A>  As well,  we have a 
policy concerning commercial posts.  The following is taken directly 
from NY PHP's charter:

----------------------------------------
Appropriate Use of Mailing Lists

The mailing lists of New York PHP may not be used to:

   1. promote any commercial activities unless that posting has received 
prior board approval, in which case the posting shall include the words 
&quot;This posting has been approved by the Board of New York PHP&quot;;
   2. suggest that any activity, code base, or writing has been endorsed 
by or created by or supported by New York PHP if that is not the case.

The Board of New York PHP shall determine whether a violation of 
appropriate use has occurred, and if it has, the President shall issue a 
warning notice in writing to the violator.

Anyone who again violates appropriate use after having been already 
issued a warning notice shall be excluded from any and all participation 
in New York PHP.
----------------------------------------------


Your post has not been reviewed or approved by the Board at NYPHP.  
Please abide by the policies and procedures set fourth in the charter.  
The NY PHP charter can be reviewed at: 
<A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/content/about/charter.php.">http://www.nyphp.org/content/about/charter.php.</A>

Thank you,
Hans Kaspersetz
AVP Operations &amp; New Project Coordinator

</I>&gt;<i> as we often are called upon to make changes to our client's websites 
</I>&gt;<i> and we have no control over what technology they use. You must be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to work hands on or communicate required changes to our client's 
</I>&gt;<i> webmasters. Support will be as much of your job as development is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're also interested in designers. Flash, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> We like cross-platform solutions that look good, are easy to use, and
