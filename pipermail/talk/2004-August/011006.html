  Yuri,

  thanks for your opinion i am going to talk with the client and see what
can be done.  It is actually a client of another company who wanted me to
quote the job.  I think they just want me to develop this really cheap to
increase thier profits i am not sure.  Thanks for all of your input on this
situation.

    Joe -- in this instance-- your quote was rather fair in my eyes.. but
hey once they say its too much.. refer to the proposal and say -- ok which
elements can we remove so that we can fit the proposal into your alloted
budget.... if they still give you alot of BS, wish them well and move on.
Just my 2 cents.

    regards

      Yuri,

      that's just it, it's not a typical shopping cart, they want to have
several store fronts that can sell items.  Multiple shops where a user can
navigate and order products from more than one shop in one transaction.

      They also want an admin area for each shop, the main admin interface
limited by access, such as admin1 has access to part of the admin area and
admin2 can have access to more parts of the admin area.  If it wasnt
confidential i would forward the docs to the list so you could see all of
the features.

      They want to be able to have a portal for the users so that they can
have

      They can see the weather
      See the stock market
      See front page news from local newspapers
      Horoscopes
      Match.com
      The top boxoffice numbers

      Search integration including not limited to

      yahoo, google

      such stuff as
      -message board
      -classifieds
      -their profile
      -newsletter
      -events
      -Email to a Friend recommend us kind of thing and win points program.
      -Discounts, shopping within the site&#146;s community members. So they can
shop between themselves and have a community discount .

      so as you can see it is much more than a typical shopping cart.

      this project will probably take me upwards of 6-8 months

      Joe Crawford Jr.

        For a shopping cart -- maybe a little. But you would know
better..you met with them and could feel them out. But hey -- a deal is made
when you have a willing seller and a willing buyer! Is the quote for a
jewelry store?

          Guys i have put in a quote for a site similar to

          <A HREF="http://www.novica.com/">http://www.novica.com/</A>

          and the person said the quote was way too much, my quote was
$25,000 for the entire site to be done that is tax free for them, meaning i
am paying my own taxes.  Thier site included a ton of statistic features and
quickbooks report integration etc...

          Do you guys think i quoted high or low?
