<PRE>Thank you all for the quick replies.

&gt;<i>From the responses to my question, I gather that there isn't a way to
</I>explicitly state from *within a PHP script* that I want mail to go to a
specific mail exchange server. Is that accurate? If so, the rest of this
message could be considered somewhat off-topic as it applies to the DNS and
not really to PHP.

Please accept my apologies in advance for that. Is there a good DNS forum
somewhere which would be more suited to these questions?

As it currently stands, I've set up a &quot;plain crazy&quot; forwarding scheme so
that, at the very least, things are &quot;working.&quot;

Does this mean that Exim is not even looking up the MX record to begin with?
If so, then wouldn't deleting the MX record from the Cpanel (if that's even
possible) be superfluous? If Exim isn't looking up the MX records then what
good would it to do alter them on LunarPage's? External emails (i.e, emails
sent from home or other networks) work properly because they never get into
LunarPage's servers. It's only when the email originates at a LunarPages
server does the email get routed incorrectly.
