*IMAGE*
*TITLE*
*SUBTITLE*
*DESCRIPTION*
*DATE*
*LINK* to file
*FILE* into folder IMAGE

Hi PHPers,

Once in a while I need some help on some projects I receive and use sub
contractors. One of my programmers, who has been doing a great job,
unfortunately needs to leave the city for a while. I am in search of a
replacement. If you are interested, please bring your resume over to the
PHP Meetup (http://php.meetup.com/) and we'll chat over some beer.
Please don't send resumes to my email.

Anyone know a good/or has developed a good library for Relax NG 
verification on an XML document?  I googled for it and found mostly all 
written in Java and would like to see if anyone was doing related stuff 
before I tried writing my own.

Thanks.

I am assuming that while in the midst of starting a new project from 
absolute scratch it would be 100x better to use ADODB vs. any other code 
and have not seen any reason to doubt using it, are there any drawbacks 
before starting?  Anyone had bad experience with using it for all ur DB use?

Thanks.

I used ADODB for Oracle and MySQL database (http://www.sentoo.sn) but I prefere 
PEAR which is developped and maintained by the PHP Group.

I'll probably be using MySQL  -- Oracle is expensive and my friend's
company is not that big yet.  As for unicode, the servers are physically
located in Taiwan and much of the translation work deals with Chinese, so
dealing with unicode won't be too much of a problem.  I'm sure most of the
problems one runs into dealing with unicode have already been dealt with.

The MySQL docs have a whole chapter about these issues:
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Character_sets.html

I think MySQL handles these things in a simpler manner than Oracle.

Subject: mysql design tools
Message-ID: <OF3D817DC4.55FA4460-ON85256C46.006D76EA@pok.ibm.com>


As much as I enjoy typing "create table...", "show index...",  in mysql,
when big projects come, I wish I had something similar to (CA's) ERwin,
that allows you to create and maintain your db out of data diagrams (pretty
handy when you have multiple developers. Just print an oversized copy and
paste it to the wall in front of you).

Being an industrial tool (and industrially priced), CA didn't even bother
making drivers for a "free db" like mysql.

So, my question is, does anybody know any data model design/management
tool with mysql (or postgresql) support ?
(I'm looking for some graphical ide to separate logical from physical
models, and not an admin tool like phpmyadmin)



btw... if anybody's going to the php meetup for the first time, here are
some pictures of the place/last meeting
http://www.remotelounge.com/consolePhotos/index.php?directoryOfChoice=09-05-2002&month=9&year=2002
not everybody featured is a php programmer... just some of channels 4 and 6

yes, I use mysql as well. it is better than oracle to handle mutiple languages from some point. Mysql is a databse that whatever you put in, you can get exactly the same out. you don't need to warry about charsets. If you will do some thing on Chinese and Japanese, it will have some troubles: Chinese has two charsets: GB2312 and Big5. Japanese also has more charsets. maybe you need two open source programs: recode and jcode to do the convert.

ODBC probably isn't complete enough, if even supported?

Maybe something like:

http://www.mysqlstudio.com/detail.php3

http://cbbrowne.com/info/rdbmstools.html  possibly for PG.

      } else {

         $request .= "Connection: Close\

      }

      $ret = '';

      // Write the Request 
      fputs ($fp, $request);

      // Get the response 
      while (!feof($fp)) $ret .= fgets ( $fp, 128 );

      // close the connection 
      fclose ($fp);
   }

   return $ret;

 }

I do not want to change WebGet as I wish to keep it a universal function that can be used for cookies or not.

So, how can I get rid of the trash on my page?

Thanx
Phil

You can try PowerAMC or PowerDesigner (the recent version of AMCDesigner), I 
used to design mysql and oracle database. you can get the try version at sybase

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How do you strip Header Info from displaying on your browser?
In-Reply-To: <200210030427.g934R34M016932@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <NFBBJNKBNKCIKGKJIFPJGEMHDLAA.sklar@sklar.com>

If you *must* continue to use this WebGet() function, process the return
value like this:

$r = WebGet('www.sklar.com');
list($headers,$body) = explode("\\r\
\\r\
",$r);
print $body;

Each header ends with "\\r\
" and the headers and the body are separated with
a blank line, so "\\r\
\\r\
" delimits the headers and the body.

If you can use the Curl extension, try that, it's much easier:

$c = curl_init('http://www.sklar.com/');
curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER);
$body = curl_exec($c);
curl_close($c);

Or you can use the HTTP_Request PEAR module, available at:
--> http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=33

In-Reply-To: <200210041500.g94F0e4M037381@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <NGBBIDLNCJJKIBJPNEHEKEGPDCAA.beef@interport.net>

Hello All,

Has anyone used the LinkPoint PHP Wrappers? What do you think?
http://www.linkpoint.com/product_solutions/internet/inet_index.html

How about:
Verisign's Commerce Site Pro (Includes Site Cert for SSL)
iTransact's RediCharge
iBill's Processing Plus Gateway

I'm building an online store w/ CC processing, and need a lot of control
over the transcation so I can update the inventory db, etc. For my part, I
want as little development hassle as possible -- of course, I have to
balance that against my client wanting to pay as little as possible.

Something that makes a feature/$ comparison even more difficult is the
difference in the pricing structure for these services:
Verisign - $1395/year
iTransact - $295/setup + $300/year (+ Thawte Site Cert for $150/year)
iBill - $0.25/Transaction (~$900/year?) (+ Thawte Site Cert for $150/year)

I'd guesstimate about 300 transactions/month, which would make iBill
$900/year

Anyway, any thoughts about any of these services in terms of ease of
development would be appreciated. Please post to the list.

TIA!

I've used both.
Card Services and Link point suck.  Their CS is super poor.  In fact, my
company hasn't used them in 2 years, and we still pay them $ every month
because you can only cancel during certain time frame windows, and they
make it very difficult.  They follow a NETSOL or AOL type CS philosophy.


Verisign works quite nicely with PHP.

My favorite, and cheapest if you do lots of transactions is MCVE
(www.mcve.com)

You need to purchase the daemon, but then you talk directly to the bank
cutting out the middleman.  Software is around 1000 perpetual license.
Support for one year.

There is a PHP module to compile in (--with-mcve) and it works quite
smoothly.

Until we get a job board online (any takers on doing this?) posting to

Hopefully, some lucky individual will see this one.

I would but like being solo and don't have 4 (?!) solid years in PHP.  Don't
know many who do for that matter. What version were they on five years ago?
Wasn't it still known as [P]ersonal [H]ome [P]age then?  Old days.

Subject: Templating and authentication
Message-ID: <20021008045202.GJ24558@eye.surgam.net>

I just joined this list, although I've been coding in PHP for a while
now. It was good to meet some of you at the meetup last week!

I'm working on a dynamic configuration-driven autogenerated CMS in
PHP, and I'm looking for a templating system to hook into it for the
display side. I'm thinking something along the lines of velocity -
ideally even something that can read velocity templates (since I hope
to also port the system to java at some point).

Any suggestions?

(Also, Hans - please get in touch with me about your authentication
system, since I didn't get your email address.)

I like vlib template:
http://vlib.activefish.com/

There is a java library for reading the same template format:
http://html-tmpl-java.sourceforge.net/

And this template format was originally part of Perl's HTML::Template
http://html-template.sourceforge.net/

The way it works is using object methods, or arrays, or both, you push 
your variables into the template object.  It supports simple scalars, 
if then statements, loops, and a few automatic variables.  The template 
syntax is designed to be HTMLish and has a limited set of commands to 
keep it simple and keep design and logic separate.  It also has a nice 
command to take an SQL result and make it into a loop variable, making 
putting most database results into a template a one liner.  I really 
like it and use one of the above on all my projects.  There are slight 
differences between the libraries, so just be aware of them if you want 
to write cross language templates.  It does appear to be a bit 
different in approach than velocity though.

This looks like it should do nicely. Thanks!

Although the template language is different, this seems to be the ame
basic approach as velocity - instantiate a template parser, choose a
template, pack some substitution variables, and then parse the output.

	I've been involved in the same type of projects before and been in the 
same situations. Although I decided at the time that creating static 
versions of the content each time a user updated it in the CMS, I have 
had a good amount of experience with template systems. The majority of 
template engines written solely in PHP seem to have the downfall of 
using eregs which on a high load can produce a good amount of latency.
	
	Another option is to exec a process which does the templating, which 
also has a decent amount of latency, but when replacing a very large 
amount of variables may be a viable solution. Such an outside solution 
may also be good if you are in need of the use of templates outside of 
your project, such as external scripts in Java or Perl, etc. ClearSilver 
(www.clearsilver.net) may be a good example of this, and I think there 
is an apache module for it too (a friend of mine started work on a PHP 
module to replace the exec call, but never finished it if I recall 
correctly).

The best solution I've seen to date is FastTemplate 
(http://www.thewebmasters.net/php/FastTemplate.phtml) modified to use a 
custom template php module. The module was not very near to being done 
and was written by a past employer of mine, basically taking out the PHP 
call to ereg and replacing it with a finite state machine. I'm not 
really sure why no one has put a suitable amount of time into a similar 
module for PHP as I think it would be widely used.

Regardless, depending on your needs you have a few choices.

Well, ideally, for any kind of traffic, the templating system should
be combined with caching (I've done a lot of work building Vignette
systems, and the caching is one of the few things I really like about
their system). However, I'm not there yet. I've heard reasonably good
things about squid to that effect, but have yet to explore how (well)
it works with php.

Vlib template can store parsed versions of the template files, in order 
to speed things up, and remove the eregs from each request.  It will 
just load the "compiled" template and insert the variables and spit it 
out.

I've used HTML::Template in perl to save its results to static files.  
I've used that for product catalogs, because they only change at known 
times and involve most of the clicking on a commerce site.

Message-ID: <3DA44CD3.BD46E965@bard.edu>

hope i don't sound as confused as i am.  not all questions may be
answerable here, but to set the scene:

i've tried to configure (on redhat 7.2) apache 1.3.26 w/ php4.2.2 &
mysql 3.23.51 source tar or .52rpm - whatever i can get to work.

1)  if i have php, mysql & perl installed on the sys, do i have to
include them in the other configs. ie configuring php --with-mysql? & in
configuring apache --with-perl.  or are these built in lighter
versions?  am i right mod's, ie mod_php is just a lighter version of php
& not necessary if i have php 4.2.2 installed?  or does that mod_php tie
apache to php?

i...
apache:
configure --enable-module-so
		  
mysql:
configure --enable-assembler --with-innodb

php:
(i'm thinking i don't need --activate-module=src/module/php4/libphp4.a
if not using php_mod, but rather the full php)
configure 	--with-apxs
		--with-ldap
		--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql 
	php worked if i source compiled mysql 3.23.51 which created
/usr/local/mysql dir.

but mysql would fail after config on: mysqladmin -u root -password
"new-passwd" 
err: mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost'failed error: 'can't
connect to local mysql server thru socket '/tmp/mysql.sock'(2).  check
that mysqld is running & that socket exists.  well it wasn't & it didn't

so i reconfig mysql with simplier 3.23.52 rpm, which would run thru the
config ok, create the socket, start the daemon, but would populates
files all over the sys and not create /usr/local/mysql dir, so without
php config --with-mysql (no path) php would fail syntax in the
hpptd.conf:  
LoadModule php4_module libexec/libphp4.so - "cannot load
/usr/local/apache/libexec/libphp4.so into server:libmysqlclient.so".

2)  do i just eliminate in php config --with-mysql all together? & then
how do the mysql php interact?

All the ASP/Linux packages I have worked with have not mirrored the ASP/IIS
environment closely enough to be of value to me.  If someone has had a
differing experience, I would love to hear it since I have a customer who
wants to move some of the more critical ASP apps to Linux but does not want
to tweak the app.

You may want to look at http://wwws.sun.com/software/chilisoft/ but it's not cheep.
I was looking for a similar solution a few years ago but then the module for apache was incomplete and did not mimic all of the MS ASP functions that I wanted to use. I imagine that they have improved it though. 

I wound up using pws as a production server.

I have been dealt a project in ASP.  I know that a few people on the 
list also develop ASP, so does anyone know of a download (preferably 
free although not holding out any hopes) to parse my scripts on Linux / 
Apache?  I'm coming in to this very late, the site only needs some 
finalization and additions to the CMS but I want to work as usual, on my 
local machine without FTPing every friggin minor edit.

Hi,
 
Does anybody have any experiences designing LAMP for a large environment?
As far as I know, LAMP is a 2-tier architecture.  There isn't an application
server such as JBOSS, Weblogic, or Zope that sits in between.  Any
suggestion on how to go about this problem is greatly appreciated.
 
By the way, this is in reference to osCommece and Nola integration.  The
integration is about 95% done.  We are dressing it up now.  Hopefully, we
can release the product to the public domain within a month or two.  If you
want to sign up for a test drive of a fully integrated ERP and eCom system,
please send me an email.  Our next goal is to integrate or build our own
CRM/XRM module.  Once again, if you are interested in helping out, please
email me.
 
Best regards,

Just a quick note.. You will probably not get some MS only ASP components with chilisoft ASP or any other non-MS ASP solution. One of the more important ones of such modules is the CDONTs objects. (i believe you need to use these if you want to send emails etc among other things). I believe there's also another to enable uploads..

I don't know if chilisoft has added support for this to their offering in the last few months, but I would definetely make sure it'll work for my needs before spending time on installing and configuring it.

Yes.  That gives PHP the ability to talk to MySQL.  It makes PHP be 
compiled with the MySQL functions.

This enables the apache/perl module.  It speeds things up.  Either way,
you can still call Perl scripts as standalone CGIs.

Similarly, mod_php installs the apache/perl module, which speeds up 
execution.  If you install PHP separately, you can then also execute PHP 
scripts in CGI mode.

In both cases, CGI mode would have the script execute as the owner of the 
script while the module versions execute as the Apache process.

I run MySQL on Windows NT, so am not completely familliar with installing 
it on linux, but I believe you need to install MySQL as normal.  Then 
start the daemon by issuing a "mysqld" command.

Find where the files are created and set your my.conf and/or other
configuration files/commands appropriately.

Sorry, you sound pretty confused  :)  Maybe I can point you in the
right direction.

It's important to pick either RPM or src and then stick with it.  If
this is new for you, try RPM.  My RPM is a little rusty, but maybe
something like this would help:

rpm -q apache
rpm -q php
rpm -q mysql

These will query to see what RPM packages are installed, which should
give you a base to work from.  If all three are installed (and you're
not worried about being up to date) you can probably startup apache
with something like apachectl start and mysql with something like
/etc/init.d/mysql.server start

Search redhat.com and zend.com/phpbuilder.com/etc, as they have some
good tutorials for this type of thing.

Also useful might be:
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/database/RHDB-7.1.3-Manual/prog/c7614.html

Yes - this enables MySQL within PHP

No, this has nothing to do with compiling with mod_perl support.  Don't
use --with-perl.

Nothing to do with lighter versions.

If you've installed the RPMs, you don't need to do anything further,
except start the daemons.

>  or does that mod_php tie apache to php?

mod_php is php that is loadable into Apache.

Now we're getting into source compiliation, which is something
different.  I would recommend sticking with RPM, but maybe
http://nyphp.org/presentations/ampintro2/ can give you some pointers on
compiling.

Unless you plan on using PHP as a CGI, you'll need that.

Good enough.

You'll probably need to do something like:
/usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld &   first

And here we have it - a crossed RPM/compiled environment.  Pick one,
and run with it :)

No.. --with-mysql is important (or --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql)

And when in doubt, remember to run ldconfig once in a while  :)

Godspeed,

Hi Larry. There are much experiences of designing LAMP for large 
environments. Look at SQLRelay and Apache Proxy.

Using these, you can do;
1. content redirection
2. content caching
3. database connection and caching

There are a number of packages to do load-balancing of database server 
as well as application servers in this regard.

You mean; rpm -e apache     to erase?

Suppose you have packages named "blabla.rpm"
You can run;

rpm -Uvh blabla.rpm

It will replace in verbose mode.

Hi Hans and team,

Haven't seen you guys for a while.  I've been skipping your meeting due to
this project.  My team also meets on Wednesday evening.  Once we're done
with the integration, we love to demo it.  There are many new features that
were added as well.

Thanks for the URLs.  I'll check them out.

Larry

Sounds interesting.. maybe you and your team would like to give a

While there isn't a required seperate application server you could use 
the Zend Accelerator 
(http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-accelerator.php) or if you 
don't want to use that develop with the MVC model, where you seperate 
web pages and most of the code so you can have servers optimized for 
each part.

That's my take at least.

-q to query, so he knows what's installed.  Then -e to erase if needed,
or -U to upgrade or -F to freshen (upgrades only if package is already
installed).

I'd put this together a long time ago.. It's the very basics of RPM. 5% of the available commands, but these constitute 90% of what a regular user would need to do everyday.

While we aren't LAMP, we are pretty close - LAOP (Oracle, not MySQL).
To the best of my knowledge we're the busiest PHP powered site in the world
( 800 million page view a month in Jan 2002) so I can definitely say that L,

The problem is that I need to code and run ASP as if I were on IIS (just the
thought makes me cringe).  I have ASP2PHP installed on my box, it's
available as a package in Mandrake 8.0 and I used it a while ago to see how
accurate it was.  If anyone is interested, I will be using Sun's ASP
solution and can report of my success or failure in detail once I get
involved with the code.

You can scale LAMP (minus MySQL which is barely a database) to some
degree, but it isn't really the best way to approach it.  PHP was not
built to be an enterprise language.  The lack of the N-Tier model makes
it great for most sites, but true enterprise level needs would be better
approached with J2EE or .Net.  Using .Net or J2EE (Java) will make the
final solution much easier to use, manage, scale, and deploy.  Though
the word "enterprise" is thrown around too much and often isn't used
accurately, applications that truly are enterprise do need to take into
account a lot of the advantages of the N-Tier model.  PHP has XML-RPC to
all remote calls in a distributed architecture if I remember correctly,
but it isn't very efficient.  For instance, Java's RMI (Remote Method
Invocation) implementation is much more robust for this purpose.  If you
must use PHP for an enterprise solution, use a strong RDBMS (MySQL is
definitely not in this category) and some form of load balancing or
clustering as opposed to an attempted distributed architecture w/ PHP.

So, Kyle, what is "true enterprise level," then? A billion pageviews per
month? The 800B PV/month Ophir cited at CCI works out to about 300/second,
and I presume that doesn't include images or other static objects.

Tell me, where is the point that MySQL breaks down? Traffic? Functionality?
I admit, MySQL doesn't have, say, the World's Greatest parallel hot-failover
technology, but I don't think anyone would classify Oracle's efforts in this
regard in that way either.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for using the right tool for the job, and MySQL
or PHP or Linux or Apache aren't each the right tool for every job. But if
you're going to insist that PHP or MySQL has problems, please point out
actual problems, instead of vague assertions.

Thanks,

David

tx.

to confirm - so i can have both a mod & standalone cgi (thou i don't
know why i'd want both but the programmers don't seem to know their
environment so i'm just thinking of covering all bases till i get a
handle on it.)

i found that php 4.2.2 if mysql not specified in config, then it's auto
built in

so i've got php working but mysql won't do anything from within the
server including basic #myqladmin version or variable info, returns
w/error: 

"MySQL said: 
Host '204.nnn.nnn.nn' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server"

& docs point to 'make sure mysqld running- it is, & /tmp/msql-4socket
exists -it does, so something else w/access prblm so i have to find
mysql talk & maybe they'll know something

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Scaling LAMP Architecture
References: <200210101426.g9AEQMix055634@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <08ef01c2706e$590ec990$bf65a8c0@tag1002>

I'd like to clear up some potential confusion about the term "scalable".
See http://labs.google.com/glossary?q=scalable for some pretty good
definitions.
While we all agree (hopefully) about what scalable means, I think we're
talking about two different things that we're trying to scale.
You can talk about scalability of a web site in regards to:
1. Traffic and users - meaning if we get 100 times the traffic can we simply
add 100 times the hardware without the need make any significant changes to
the code/architecture.
2. Application complexity - meaning if we want to add more functionality to
the site, can we do so without making significant changes to the existing
code/architecture.

While I think it's obvious that LAP scale quite well in regards to traffic
(CCI proves this), I do agree that in regards to application complexity,
there are better solutions than PHP (though much more $$$$ to use and
probably slower)

My 2 cents.

Ophir

p.s.
Regarding MySQL breaking down, I do believe the problem was with
connections, not speed.
It just didn't hold up when trying to keep a few thousand simultaneous
connections to the MySQL server.
Oracle amazingly seems to do ok. It might slow down, but it doesn't
crash/die/freeze.

Right.  While there's no technical reason not to do so (libs are libs,
bins are bins) you can run into version/configuration mismatches, and
most importantly sysadmin confusion.

Try to keep them in parallel - especially since RPM packages have
options/dependancies specific to one another.

Yeah, -U is always misleading to me - I shouldn't be able to upgrade
something that doesn't exist; but I guess RPM calls it "freshen".

Yeah I agree, people tend to diss products based on either old info, old 
versions, or just bad initial info (did it myself to PHP when came to 
crossroads of PHP vs. JSP about a year ago) ... Id also like to hear 
what MySQL's problems are as my days of taking time to dabble with 
Oracle or Sybase are over :-)  

I also can't see how one can find a definitive answer for scaling when 
1/2 the equation is based on how much money you put into scaling anyway, 
better equipment and more memory will always help any platform 
(PHP/J2EE/.Net) ...

The shotgun method - works well, until you need to upgrade/patch  :)

It's always better to use MySQL's client libs.  ie, when configuring
php:

./configure --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql

Maybe.

Obviously, your permission tables aren't setup properly.  There are a
couple of issues:

1) if you connect to localhost or the FQDN or alias of a system, MySQL
will see the connection as comming from different hosts.

2) if you INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE the mysql.* tables directly, you need to
FLUSH PRIVILEGES for the changes to take effect.

3) Use GRANT/REVOKE.  Read:
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Privilege_system.html
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/User_Account_Management.html

I don't know how you've installed it. But if you've installed from source, there's a step which you perform to set up the initial system tables. 
(scripts/mysql_install_db)

See the following page. I've installed MySQL about 50 times using these instructions. (no I don't memorize stuff like this).  It has never failed. Most times you can actually copy/paste most of the stuff.

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Quick_install.html

If you have alrady run mysql_install_db or you have installed RPM (hence install_db shouldn't be the issue) reset the password by doing the following in shell as root.

killall mysqld
safe_mysqld --skip-grant-tables &      # (i think new versions call this mysqld_safe )
mysql

Once in the mysql monitor, run the following two queries.

use mysql;
UPDATE user SET password = PASSWORD("new_password") WHERE user = 'root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;   # you don't need this since you'll restart again.
quit;

Then in shell again:

killall mysqld;
safe_mysqld&


Have fun. --oktay--

well i've certainly hit the admin confusion here, & prbly mismatches

since i've got apache & php installed via binary (or source - still
confused on that) but mysql is rpm'd, so i'll rpm -e the mysql & install
it over again w/the binary (or source).  would hate to change the apache
or php as they're working!  & i'll just reconfig the php with the client
lib /configure --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql as to me that seems cleaner
& besides you also recommended it!  nice to have thought process in a
new area confirmed

Yes, perhaps the relevant criterion is the scalability of one's bank

When there's confusion, there should be some explanation.

binary : as in precompiled on a different box and ready to run on another
source : you do './configure && ./make && ./make install' yourself. Compiled on your box.
rpm    : a package format to make managing software easier. rpm's are esentially *binary* files that adhere to a specification. (i.e specs describe where the files go, what scripts are run during the install etc) Other examples of binary package management systems are Debian's .deb, Slackware's .tgz  etc.

There's yet another system where there's a package management system in place but the software is built from source on your own computer. (FreeBSD ports and Gentoo portage are examples of this)

originally installed source mysql v.49, but missed the step "shell> cp
support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf".  maybe that's where i
orginally ran into trbl.  so gonna rpm -e v.52, & install from source
the v.52.  tx

tx. i know the resulting dif between bin/src/rpm (but didn't know
.deb/.tgz.  interesting on freebsd & gentoo)

but in downloading i can't tell from zipped tar file names  which is
binary & which is source as they seem to be same format ie. php or
mysql-ver-os.tar.gz.  unless maybe directory structure specific, but i
didn't catch then when looking at mirrors

i hate shotgun from maintenance standpoint - but when under fire...

in fact i have to drop this server till tues as i have been given
priority to another needed by tues. so you may not hear any more
confusion till then.

tx. for doc pointers.  can spend lifetime reading & like to start in the
right direction at least for production purposes

was disappointed to miss recent nyc php users group discussing
apache/php/mysql - was exactly what i needed!

Yeah.. I remember downloading the binary tar.gz rather than the source one in the past.. For some odd reason mysql.com lists the source packages at the very bottom on their download page (
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html) while the binary package(s) are listed at the top.

Question: What OS are you using? If Windows, what flavor? If Linux, what

Sure wish I was closer to get to your meetings; but we have nothing like your 
group  here in the Philly area. Guess there to busy eating Cheese Steaks or

i've usually been ftp'ing so not noticed the web window layout -duh -
i'm ashamed..

but the linux binary filename specifies pc - are the apps for php &
mysql same for pc as server & just oddly named?  i shy'ed from something

David,

MySQL lacks in quite a few areas.

1) It has poor performance under heavy loads
2) It lacks key functionality
3) Data integrity is currently a big problem
4) Large amounts of data are handled poorly
5) It lacks replication and other enterprise level features
6) Backup and recovery features could use improvement

Just use MySQL for a while and try to do anything like a join on more
than two tables.  It chokes.  Other databases are built to handle real
and heavy processing, whereas MySQL is built for smaller needs.  Some
will argue the de-normalizing data is always the way to go anyway, but
unless you are data warehousing there is no need to do it.  It just
creates poor database design.  You might be able to get away with using
MySQL on some heavier projects, but that doesn't make it the right tool
for the job.  As for your enterprise question, I classify enterprise
level as an application (this is not limited to web applications) that
is currently or possibly going to be under heavy load and needs to be
distributed over multiple machines effectively.  The application needs
to be scalable to decrease the risk of poor application performance with
increasing loads.  As I said this is often misclassified because people
throw the word around without cause.  Most applications don't have
enterprise needs, which makes PHP a great choice for development.

So, Kyle, what is "true enterprise level," then? A billion pageviews per
month? The 800B PV/month Ophir cited at CCI works out to about
300/second,
and I presume that doesn't include images or other static objects.

Tell me, where is the point that MySQL breaks down? Traffic?
Functionality?
I admit, MySQL doesn't have, say, the World's Greatest parallel
hot-failover
technology, but I don't think anyone would classify Oracle's efforts in
this
regard in that way either.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for using the right tool for the job, and
MySQL
or PHP or Linux or Apache aren't each the right tool for every job. But
if
you're going to insist that PHP or MySQL has problems, please point out
actual problems, instead of vague assertions.

Thanks,

We can debate what "heavy loads" means, and Ophir's earlier comment about a
few thousand simultaneous connects may be a good example of an area where
MySQL has problems. In general, though, I don't agree with much of your
assessment above.

The only "key" piece of functionality that I've heard people complain about
recently is sub-selects. If your application requires sub-selects, then yes,
MySQL isn't the database for you.

The InnoDB engine offers excellent transaction support, foreign keys, and
data recovery. If you want, you can even pay $400 for a hot-backup utility
that lets you setup MySQL replication slaves with no downtime for failover.

What's a "large amount" of data? I've succesfully used MySQL with gigabytes
of data in tables that have millions of rows. With multi-table joins. What
were you doing that ran into problems? Having appropriate hardware and
configuration is important for success.

Again, I make no claim that MySQL is perfect. It has no stored procedures,
for example. But if you're going to knock something (be it MySQL, Oracle, or
Berkeley DB), provide some specifics. Maybe you tried to use MySQL and
Oracle on similar hardware and Oracle provided better performance? Maybe
Oracle is easier to tune for a particular situation that MySQL? Maybe even
(and this is IMHO a perfectly justifiable reason to pick a technology) you
or your company has more in-house Oracle knowledge than MySQL?

What has drawn me into this thread, however, is criticisms like "It lacks
replication and other enterprise level features". This obviously false --
search on Google for "mysql replication" and the first link that pops up is
to the section of the MySQL manual about Replication.

I'm a big fan of normalized data.

What prevents PHP from being scaled across multiple machines and across
machines of increasing strength to accomodate application load growth?

Greetings!

I have just joined the list and find this topic interesting.  I am a VB/ASP
programmer and have to this point used both in conjunction with MS SQL
Server 7 with successful results.

My company has asked me to develop an accounting package for them and once
it done using CGI or PHP and MySQL (despite the fact that we own a full
license to MS SQL Server) as they are migrating from Microsoft to Linux for
various reasons.

I have many hesitations using MySQL as a back end for an accounting program.
Access to the database will be at a maximum of 3 people at any given time,
so server load should not be too heavy.  Eventually I may have 20 people
connecting to an orders database tied in.

So my question is, aside from the small user loads and performance related
issues, is MySQL reliable for handling such critical accounting data?

Things that scare me are lack of referential integrity, lack of
transactions, backup and recovery.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Anthony

You might not know it yet, but you're very lucky :)

I'm kind of in an opposite situation right now, moving away from PHP & MySQL and towards .NET & MS SQL.

I think the question you need to ask yourself is this.

Are they really trying to migrate as much of their stuff as possible to Linux and MySQL? The reason I'm asking is this. If this accounting package will be a standalone system and not need to communicate with other systems, then you might as well do it using ASP and MS SQL. (though I would recommend using PHP anyway, regardless of the database)

If you will need several systems to talk to each other in the future and there's a trend in the company "for various reasons" to migrate to linux, then you should try to consolidate as many of your systems as possible on linux. This will make communication between the systems much easier and your SQL queries much simpler.

As for your questions about whether MySQL can do the job.. .. MySQL has a very simplistic way of doing things. This is not necessarily inferior. Backups and restores are extremely easy to do and there are multiple ways to do it. (SQL dump vs actual data files). IMO, you are all right as long as you take periodic backups and run a stable kernel on your OS. (I recall something about a data corruption issue with some kernels)

Yes. If you are using more than a P133 for this load, you will be fine. (I
know that sounds sarcastic, but I'm not. It really doesn't need much
horsepower.) To ensure safe handling of the accounting data, use the InnoDB
table type so that you can use transactions and referential integrity.

InnoDB will handle all of this for you just fine. You probably don't need
their fancy backup utility either. What volume of data are you dealing with?
Something like this might be useful:

Talk to different practitioners of different databases. They will come 
up with this type of heresay.  There have been side-by-side comparisons 
fo these databases. MySQL does not do badly. But then, if you want more 
enterprise DB, think PostgreSQL.

Usually, MYSQL is used by people with less means; no hardware 
controller, no fiber, no SAN. Hey, wait a few months. We will have iSCSI 
and sanify if MS comes up with the driver. I doubt it, though.

You give me a database which you replicated successfully.  I doubt you

Support and maintenance is usual weak point for open-source as

MYSQL can handle your load. Consider NOLA and it was originally 
developed for Becktel, one of the largest public construction company.

As someone mentioned, INNODB deals with some of these issues. It should 
be fine. We have done MYSQL support and PG support as well as commercial 
DBs.  It is pretty solid. Only times I saw problems are operator errors 
and having millions of rows and disk filling up.

Some web analytics engine we worked with.

While there were kernel issues, there are still issues with GCC.  This
is why MySQL lists it's source last, and recommends their binary
distributions, as came up in another thread.  Older/newer versions of
GCC fix this, and FreeBSD has never had any problems that I've seen.

No problem - you won't even need persistent connections with MySQL.

It has been with us, with far more than 20 users.

These are not lacking at all.  It all depends on implementation.  I'm
of the idealogy that DBs are for storing data, and that programming
languages are for everything else.  While MySQL does lack some SQL
bells and whistles (which are being addressed in the
not-too-distant-future), it's a different beast than the Oracles and
DB2s of the world.

MySQL is designed for fast and effeceint access and simple maintenance
- as I noted in one of the AMP Intro presentations, a "SQL-enabled
filesystem."  That said, it is used in many large/"enterprise"
situations, with great success:

http://www.mysql.com/press/user_stories/index.html

The yahoo finance story is very interesting, and Jeremy is an asset for
tuning and tips.

So what does thousands of dollars for Oracle/etc get you?

1) Someone to blame, besides your self, when it breaks. ("Hey, I'm
using Oracle, it's not my fault").

2) From a techical standpoint, Oracle is very forgiving.  Bad
applications and implementations can be written, and if given enough
hardware/money, they will run.  Not so with MySQL.

3) MySQL depends on good design, implementation, and in the end,
thought.

4) Most importantly:  When you pay the money for Oracle, you're buying
what boils down to thought.  When you download MySQL for nothing, it's
up to you to do it right.

I've seen Oracle die on 200 connections, and MySQL hum on gigabytes of
data.  And MySQL die with a crazy join and Oracle squeak by with enough
RAM.

They're different animals, better suited for different applications,
but most of the work I've seen, can be done on MySQL with proper
design.  Lastly, don't forget that Oracle has had billions of dollars
and millions of man-hours dedicated to it - MySQL is the new kid on the
block.

Anthony,

How far have you gotten with your development process on the accounting
program?  My team did a lot of works on NOLA (web-based accounting or ERP).
If you want, you can take our newly modified version and see if it suite
your environment.  It's an open-source app.  We might be to co-develop some
new functionality for free.  Let me know if you're interested.

Larry

Greetings!

I have just joined the list and find this topic interesting.  I am a VB/ASP
programmer and have to this point used both in conjunction with MS SQL
Server 7 with successful results.

My company has asked me to develop an accounting package for them and once
it done using CGI or PHP and MySQL (despite the fact that we own a full
license to MS SQL Server) as they are migrating from Microsoft to Linux for
various reasons.

I have many hesitations using MySQL as a back end for an accounting program.
Access to the database will be at a maximum of 3 people at any given time,
so server load should not be too heavy.  Eventually I may have 20 people
connecting to an orders database tied in.

So my question is, aside from the small user loads and performance related
issues, is MySQL reliable for handling such critical accounting data?

Things that scare me are lack of referential integrity, lack of
transactions, backup and recovery.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Anthony

David,

MySQL lacks in quite a few areas.

1) It has poor performance under heavy loads
2) It lacks key functionality
3) Data integrity is currently a big problem
4) Large amounts of data are handled poorly
5) It lacks replication and other enterprise level features
6) Backup and recovery features could use improvement

Just use MySQL for a while and try to do anything like a join on more
than two tables.  It chokes.  Other databases are built to handle real
and heavy processing, whereas MySQL is built for smaller needs.  Some
will argue the de-normalizing data is always the way to go anyway, but
unless you are data warehousing there is no need to do it.  It just
creates poor database design.  You might be able to get away with using
MySQL on some heavier projects, but that doesn't make it the right tool
for the job.  As for your enterprise question, I classify enterprise
level as an application (this is not limited to web applications) that
is currently or possibly going to be under heavy load and needs to be
distributed over multiple machines effectively.  The application needs
to be scalable to decrease the risk of poor application performance with
increasing loads.  As I said this is often misclassified because people
throw the word around without cause.  Most applications don't have
enterprise needs, which makes PHP a great choice for development.

So, Kyle, what is "true enterprise level," then? A billion pageviews per
month? The 800B PV/month Ophir cited at CCI works out to about
300/second,
and I presume that doesn't include images or other static objects.

Tell me, where is the point that MySQL breaks down? Traffic?
Functionality?
I admit, MySQL doesn't have, say, the World's Greatest parallel
hot-failover
technology, but I don't think anyone would classify Oracle's efforts in
this
regard in that way either.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for using the right tool for the job, and
MySQL
or PHP or Linux or Apache aren't each the right tool for every job. But
if
you're going to insist that PHP or MySQL has problems, please point out
actual problems, instead of vague assertions.

Thanks,

David

You should read the database showdown article in eweek:
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,293,00.asp

In a recent database (feb 2002) benchmark test performed by Ziff Davis Media
Inc., the company behind PC Magazine, eWeek and other well-known
publications, MySQL stands out as a winner. MySQL is presented as having the
overall best performance and scalability along with Oracle9i. Also, MySQL
excelled in stability, ease of tuning and connectivity. Considering pricing
and ease of use, this further strengthens MySQL as being the database server
of choice for price-efficient, high-performance web use.

The databases tested were: DB2 7.2, MS SQL Server 2000, MySQL-Max 4.0.1,
Oracle9i 9.0.1.1.1 and Sybase ASE 12.5.0.1.

The main point to note here (which Ive seen noted a few times) is this:

<snip>

MySQL's great performance was due mostly to our use of an in-memory 
query results cache that is new in MySQL 4.0.1. When we tested without 
this cache, MySQL's performance fell by two-thirds.

</snip>

I have not myself used this cache but from people who have I heard it 
makes or breaks the product :-\\

Although http://www.Bookpool.com is vague about its release (simply October

You could email Bookpool or even O'rielly, they might know when that will
be.

Good Friday!

	Just a quick reminder that you might want to Save $100!

	I am actually very psyched for this thing.  I actually
got my generous company (Vermont Teddy Bear Co.) to send me out
there, although I'm paying for the hotel and "incidentals," and
I may not bring a friend.

	The Hotel said even the cheap rooms ("Cabana Deck"; $69)
have internet access; don't know what that means yet, but 24-hour
fun seems likely!

	Also the travel company is making me stay till Sunday; I
have no idea why, and I am not complaining.

	Somehow it would be nice to figure out beforehand, who
else is as juiced as I am to go to this thing!


Best, George.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Scaling LAMP Architecture
Message-ID: <F265zSk2elC4GpACszp000071ae@hotmail.com>

Hi all :)

Thank you for all of yours opinions and suggestions. All have given better 
solution for this problem as they could, and we know this problem can have 
many solutions, and finally depends upon person or company who is going to 
use and in which manner bcoz as it question of $ too J

some of you have suggested using LAMP, or LAOP or LAPgP or .NeT or j2EE and 
many more but still problem remains same. What's correct definition of 
"Scalable" system or architecture?

Well if it's just question of having such a system which can run with same 
speed and efficiency even when total hits increase from 1000 to 1 million, 
or having all above advantages plus having all enterprise features. etc then 
here we r mistaking all. There is no any solution, which can provide all of 
these advantages simultaneously and in which way we need.

So we have to find better rather than best. Here my suggestion is whatever 
tech. is used, it must be able to satisfy the owner and those who r going to 
use. Here "Satisfy" is in general terms, so whatever u think would be ok..

So main thing is not to talk advantages and disadvantage of any existing 
tech. likes comparison btwn MySql and Oracle or PHP and jSp or MsSql vs. 
PgSql or whatever, instead we need to think in diff direction like using 
concept of SDDS
Scalable Distributed Database Server and/or Multiprocessing where client 
requests are divided into small parts or are redirected to other servers or 
processor  thus keeping main server or processor less burdened.

In SDDS, Data and Files are kept on several machines rather than same server 
or 2 servers (i mean many companies use db server and scripting/file server 
as separate to get better output and faster execution). This tech is also 
known as
Client-Agent-Server tech. where u can say there is 1 main server where all 
data is kept and at second level there comes Agents machines/servers 
interacts btwn main server and client. All client servers has replica of 
main servers DB but in diff parts not as whole db so like 4 servers with 25% 
and almost all clients queries are first directed to this Agents only and 
replied/executed by these 4 servers and if needed they are redirected to 
main server and finally records btwn main server and agent servers are 
updated.

This is similar like concept of cache servers in Oracle and Java but this is 
bit new and different. The main diff is all Agent servers acts like as they 
are main servers so at client end u never know where your request is being 
redirected or which server your data is coming from?

This is like a concept of having chain store where u have McDonald's fast 
food available at New York, Syracuse and Seattle rather than all have to go 
to New York only whether u live in Syracuse or Seattle. I hope u all r 
getting what I mean.

So main point is whatever tech (Db, Scripting lang, Servers OS u use) your 
software must have Strong RDBMS, Proper coding style, Robust architecture 
maybe using SDDS tech. an other normal stuffs.

These concept can give u satisfactory solutions, otherwise there is no such 
tech. in this world which can give u all at once without having Distributed 
Database and/or multiprocessing. Also PHP guys will say PHP is best, ASP 
will say ASP is the best bcoz it has these facilities, same with DB and OS, 
ok ok we need to think in diff direction and develop something new using 
existing tech :) not just adhering to existing tools.

Thanks All,

Anirudh Zala

I think you are hitting close to the basic point of "scalable".

Lot of folks worry about "scalabe" because you may not have the 
experience of making your system scalable. Having designed many of 
"scalable" systems and lived with them, there are a lot of assumptions 
one makes. Fail-over and redundant design.... Replication.. 2-tier vs 
4-tier. What is different about 4-tier vs SDDS? Just different jargon. 
Lot of developers would throw lot of these technologies without having 
configured themselves. Having a hot-failover system configured is very 
elaborate. You need to worry about things as basic as ARP table and 
configuring multipath RAID subsystem. Lot of things have gotten easier 
over the years. But I still see many MCSE walking around with a clue of 
how to use ARP.  I have seen only few "scalable" systems over the years 
serving the business owners. It is often "tail wagging the dog" as in we 
tend to use technology as an escape hatch.

I remember seeing architectures of the world's busiest sites and the 
biggest e-commerce sites. Then, I remember being impressed of 
master-slave database servers. Absolutely the textbook case from 
Microsoft land! Over the years, my longview reveals gigantic mistakes of 
these architectures. Techies' idea of "scalable" does not scale business 
or the use.

Nowadays, I am impressed by those architectures balancing different 
objectives such as speed, flexibility and good common-sense of making 
usable systems.

One of the folks mentioned "communityconnect". Here is a good example of 
people who scaled to large traffic. For example, think of problem having 
to serve so many images including resolving multiple includes of banners 
from different web-sites.  It is normal to gain most speed improvement 
from programming practices like improving your database design and using 
index tables.

A well know moutain climber said, "It is not the equipment, it is how 
you use it.".....  If you can scale ASP and MS SQL and run some large 
sites, you can do it with PHP and MySQL. ditto.

This is a very effective way to handle large quantities of traffic, and
is needed with any DB/language/server/OS.  While Oracle supports a lot
of this as a shrink-wrapped package, there are limitations, and of
course price.  I've seen very effective implementations using
replication/MySQL/round-robin, and with a cost of only the hardware.  I
think most sites would be hard-pressed to saturate even two Pentium-4
MySQL servers with proper DB design. And scalability? Buy another
server and add an A record to your DNS.

I think you can buy a pallete of Compaq's on eBay for probably next to 
nothing. Make a cluster + php +oracle or postgres, et al. That would be 
the cheap and easy way to do it. But if you have venture capital, you 
can wow them for months with whiteboards, arcane technical details, J2EE 
enterprise models, etc and stay on the payroll much longer!

:)

Your r right, it's not imp. which tools u use, but it's imp. how effectively 
u use it.

And as i told there can be several solution for this, and may be someone 
will have better solution than i have..Gotcha

Subject: chmod - some files can be viewed, others cannot
Message-ID: <03a001c27358$89964c40$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

I have a directory $DOCUMENT_ROOT/my/images, permission 0755

I have three images in my folder with the exact same permissions: 0755; same ownership, same everything.

The files, viewed on my machine, are fine too.

However, two cannot be seen due to permissions errors; one can be seen.  All three were uploaded the exact same way too.

Anyone want to solve this riddle?  I am stumped as usual.

Thanx
Phil

Message-ID: <03a901c2735a$f51721e0$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

If your directory is set to permissions 0755, and you upload your files to be at permissions 0744, will that change the permissions of the directory?  Whenever I upload a file, even though I have an is_dir check in place for the directory, the file is uploaded with permissions of 0755 and then the file becomes 0744 and then the file becomes 0744, and then I can't view the file!

I am not grasping this whole aspect of file permissions apparently enough to be able to handle file uploading correctly within the framework of PHP.  Anyone out there know what I must do to ensure the directory remains at 0755 and the files at 0744 or 0755 and ensure they can be viewed by all?

Thanx
Phil

hi,

ok, is this an upload using php with a form?  Then files are owned by 
user nobody, which should have viewable permission, HOWEVER you should 
also check out the UMASK  command in Unix. If this an FTP upload, then 
that's another story.  Permissions can be kinda of tricky. You may to 
assume the ID of the user at the command line, create a file, and do a 
basic save, see where it ends up permissions wise. Once you get your 
UMASK set, I think you'll be ok.   No matter what u do permissions wise, 
the UMASK is going to be the default maker of permissions.

-- ed

The default file permissions (umask):
Each user has a default set of permissions which apply to all files 
created by that user, unless the software explicitly sets something 
else. This is often called the 'umask', after the command used to change 
it. It is either inherited from the login process, or set in the .cshrc 
or .login file which configures an individual account, or it can be run 
manually.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Scaling LAMP Architecture
Message-ID: <86713EAB93BD5F40B94A0C8E604C7C91AEB706@index-exchange.indexstock.com>

Hi folk,

Thank you for all the inputs on this subject.  They have been very helpful.
There are many ways to skin a cat.  As my team begins to plug open-source
applications together to build our "ossuite" (tm) package, we compromise on
time, best practice, and efficiency due to restraint on the resource.  If
all conditions exist, specifically resource [time, money, people, place,
etc.], we would have built everything from ground up.  Even with that, the
new app needs to be "scalable" enough to meet the rapidly changing business
requirements - which means ossuite needs dynamic workflow.  Instead, we
decided to integrate existing apps [NOLA and osCommerce] because we don't
want to reinvent the wheel.  It has been a very challenging and exciting
experience.

Soon, we'll integrate Relata and [Relatamail or PHPList] to ossuite.  We
hope SME (small medium enterprise) will enjoy this new free software.  We'll
launch the demo site soon.

We live, learn and share.  Write me if you guys want to collaborate with our
development process.  Upside compensation plan will be available for serious
players.

Regards,

Larry Chuon

Message-ID: <002601c273c6$025292c0$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

Is it possible, w/o using sessionid session variables, to use setcookie to set a cookie that will have two domains or more?

Just curious.  I am having to set a cookie that will go to one domain and then to another domain.  Not sure if I can do multiple setcookie commands and be able to produce the desired results.

I'm not entirely sure I understand your question, but it would be a 
security hole to allow cookies to be set for domains other than the 
originating one.  The website www.foo.com can set cookies for www.foo.com 
(sent only to www.foo.com) or .foo.com (sent to any *.foo.com site) but 
can't (shouldn't be able to) set cookies for cnn.com or any other domain.

That I figured.. which leads to a dilemma:

I can set cookies to *.domain1.com, however, I am having to also set a
cookie value, the same cookie value, to a few remote scripts on
*.domain2.com, and since setcookie can't be used twice (I tried doing that
and only *.domain1.com was set, *.domain2.com was not), I don't know of an
easy solution to set the values of both domains in at least one script?

Setcookie() can be used more than once.  The reason it isn't working is 
that it's a security violation for the website domain1.com to be able to 
modify cookies for domain2.com, and the web browser is refusing 
(correctly) to store the cookies for domain2 that you are sending.

See the cookie RFC, section 4.3.2:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc2109.html

This RFC does not accurately express the current state of cookie-handling 
in browsers (because it didn't consider country code TLD's), but, eh, 
close enough.

You can still transfer information to domain2.com by loading URLs:

http://domain2.com/script.php?yourvariable=value

and domain2.com could then set its own cookies.

yep just as I figured.. which would be a breeze were it not for the wacky
requirements of dealing with ASP, TCL, PHP and HTML files that are all
affected by this query string addition. *sigh*

Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F903341E804@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

	Hello,

	I have been lurking on the list for a while and really enjoy the
discussion.  I have been running LAMP based websites for a couple of years,
but feel its time to address some high level issues with the maintenance of
LAMP based systems.

	I have looked over and read a few books on Apache and PHP and they
really don't cover what you do after you get things running.  Some of the
issues I have run into and am looking for direction on are:

	1. What is the best way to maintain all of the server software
components:

	I bet most admin's servers like mine are much more complicated than
merely apache/mysql/php.  SSL, other database connectivity like ODBC and
TDS, encryption libraries, log readers, site indexers, link checkers,
frontpage, and so on are needed to make a site really functional.

	Some of these components have dependencies which raises issues in
getting the whole shebang working when you change one component.  So, what
is to be done to maintain the server from one generation of daemons and
programs to another? From here, other issues arise as to the best way to
move from one production server to another as in the case of an OS   or
hardware upgrade. 

	2. what is the best way to setup and maintain apache logs? What is
the best log reader?

	If you want to have automated log rotation that dovetails with both
static log readers like webalayzer or dynamic (you can do ad-hoc queries)
like analog.  Or perhaps a better log reader would streamline everything?

	3. what is the best way to setup and maintain a backup "hot"
apache/mysql server? 

	Can this be practically done with standard linux installs and the
capabilites of the OS and server daemons?

	There are many operational and maintenance questions like these
which I am finding a hard time getting answers to.  

	I am not really expecting anyone to answer these questions in
detail.  I know that someone somewhere has figured out this stuff and I
would love to know what that is. Just point me in the right direction. 

	Perhaps some book or online resource is available that addresses
these kinds of questions?  If so, please let me know what it is. I have
looked around on the web and Barnes and Noble, but have turned up little as
my patience and ability are limited.  I know its out there, somewhere.
Isn't everything?

	Thanks in advance for your time and for providing this valuable
forum.

	Mike

The way I do this is first, get two web servers running, configured
identical. Keeping them that way can be a chore, but that's another question.
Use rsync between them to keep your content current. One hole this leaves
is log files, which, to e-commerce sites, may be more important than
content, so I'd look at mysql logging from apache, os that ilk. Mysql
is simple. You can set up 2 replicated servers, but the best way
is to have 3 servers, with the master being where all the writes are
going, and replicated to the slaves, where the reads are done. Now, in
your database code, when you try to attach to your primary slave server,
if that fails, simply try to attach to your 'hot spare' server.

I know this is Perl and LDAP, but it will work the same way in PHP/Mysql.
I just happen to have this code open in my editor:

$ldap=Net::LDAP->new('ldapA.bnl.gov') or $ldap=Net::LDAP->new('ldapB.bnl.gov') or $ldap=Net::LDAP->new('ldapC.bnl.gov') or die "$@";

This way, one call should almost always yield a database connection.

Heya folks,

	Just ran into an odd bit of coding.  I wrote some Javascript
functions to manipulate options to
a dropdown lists from a text field. i.e. function addOption( listObj, option
)

	There seems to be a problem with Javascript and Sessioning when it
comes to accessing the
document object, because when PHP initially sets the browser cookie for the
session the document
object is unaccessable?

Let me give you an example:
	1. I try my page without "session_start()".  addOption() works fine.
	2. I add the session_start() to the page, addOption() generetes an
"Object expected error",
		when I try to use it. I am guessing it can't access document
object?
		using this format: document.form1.elements[i].  (the form
was named to form1)
	3. I reload the page as is, the addOption() works fine again;
		note: I didn't touch session_start() in the code. 
	4. I delete my cookies, reload the page, and the "Object expected
error" returns.

Seems that document obj disappears only when initially setting the session
cookie? Odd.
Anyone can shed some light on this particular situation?

FYI: Using IE6,  I really hate the way IE handles Javascript Errors, Loved
the way Netscape had
a Javascript console for reviewing/locating errors.

Thanks!

-Ed

Yeah, well welcome to my world. :) Take a machine down for upgrades,
have another fail, and the third be unavailable due to a network

I know this is a SQL question, but since most apps deal with SQL, I 
figured I'ld ask here since the app is using PHP and MySQL.

I have a table that establishes an entity that may have a parent from 
the same table.  I would like to display the data in a tree format where 
all items with a ParentID of 0 ( no parent ) are listed with children 
indented under the parent.  The nesting can be infinite, but 
realistically will only be 2 or 3 levels deep.  I can see how to do this 
through a whole series of queries, but can see how the performance of 
such a design could be very poor if there is a lot of items.  Looking 
for any ideas, even if they would require a table design mod to make the 
queries simpler.  The current design is a single table with ID, and 
ParentID and whatever other info needed for the item.

Thanks, Jim

I haven't used GD in a while (last compile I did with it was when the
libs were still seperate) but I think modern PHP versions come with a
bundled version, which is certainly recommended.

Hmm... Are you sure the script is running with the PHP binary/module
you think it is?  Is that the only error it gives?  If it couldn't find
the GD libs properly, you should get a different error (if it would
even compile at all).  But this error seems like PHP doesn't even know
this module is available.  Is PNG specifically enabled?  Do any of the
image functions work (getimagesize(),exif_imagetype())?  Are the
constants defined?  Did you compile it as a dynamic module? Did you
load it with dl() if so?

Also, if the PHP build was done as modules, make sure you
have the gd.so extention loded in the php.ini...

Can a parent by a child and a child be a parent?

Is so, perhaps you could have another table where the relationship is
established.

tblObjects:
objectID
fname
lname
etc. fields

tblRelationships:
relationship  - autonumber
parent
child

where parent and child are the id's from tblObjects.

I could probably be more clear if I knew the specifics of what the
entities you are using are.

There's no easy way to do this now with MySQL. In Oracle, you can use
a CONNECT BY query to return this sort of structure.

The only good news I have about this is that it is on the list of
things that ought to be included at some point:

Jim,

I had to build a tree for a project, and I found that de-normalization worked rather well.  In my case i had a tree of "subjects", therefore i created a "subject path" table with the following fields:

id                      
parent_id              
subject_id_0            
subject_id_1            
subject_id_2            
subject_id_3            
subject_id_4            
subject_id_5            
subject_id_6            
subject_name_0         
subject_name_1         
subject_name_2         
subject_name_3         
subject_name_4         
subject_name_5         
subject_name_6         
narrowest_subject_id   
narrowest_subject_name 
full_name             

also, i had a subject table:
id
name 


I knew that I would never go over 7 levels in my tree, but i could always add more fields to the subject path table if necessary.  Anyway, from the subject table and from the id and parent id fields in the subject path table, i can derive all of the other fields for each row in the subject path table.  (this would be something you can do as a pre-processed script, because you wouldn't want to figure it out during run-time since it would slow your site down.)   And I used these de-normalized fields to create the tree on the website using very simple queries (ex. SELECT narrowest_subject_name from subject_path where parent_id = 5)

Yes, I think if I get your meaning.  The app is a broadbased app for 
managing my business and extending certain parts to involved parties ( 
ie. my clients and sub contractors ).  The specific table in question is 
projects where projects can have subprojects which can have 
subprojects... as deep as you want.  So with my table design you might see:

ID  ParentID  Name
1     0             The greatgrandaddy project
2     1             grandpa 1
3     1             grandpa 2
4     2             pa 1
5     2             pa 2
6     3             pa 3
7     3             pa 4
8     5             child 1
9     5             child 2
10   5             child 3

The results of the query would lead to a display like:

The greatgranddaddy project
     grandpa 1
          pa 1
          pa 2
               child 1
               child 2
               child 3
     grandpa 2
          pa 3
          pa 4

I had thought about using the relationship table, but didn't see how 
that would make the query simpler.

A straight query of my original design will get me all the data, the 
problem is parsing that data so I can lay it out in a tree format.  If 
there were a way within the query where I can order the data on 
greatgranddaddy, granddaddy, daddy, child then it could be done in 1 
query.  But this then also assumes a tree only 3 levels deep ( which is 
plenty for this situation, but I may need this solution in other places 
as well where 3 may not be deep enough ).  This also assumes ordering by 
id's but ultimately I want it ordered by name within each tier.

This idea might hold promise for my needs.  I need to mull over.  I 
imagine I can maintain the "subject path" table at file time of  a new 
"subject" since this is a quick save query so tacking on the added time 
to backwalk the tree for the new "subject" to glean the necessary info 
to add to the "subject path" table would be hardly noticed.  I don't 
know how the sorting would be done with this design though.  If I want 
"subject" ordering within the tier, I may need to add a sortation 
weight.  The other thing would be, this design still needs multiple 
queries, for each level of each branch.

I'm thinking that since my requirements are:
   1. a parent can have many children of which can also have many children
   2. a child can have only 1 parent
   3. the tree query needs to display within an alpha sort on name 
within the tier

I might need to have a sort weight field which factors all these in when 
my entity is saved and generates a value which would allow a sort on the 
weight field to cause the query to retrieve the data in the right order 
with parents immediately followed by their children.  Then it is a 
simple matter durring display to do the necessary indenting as you 
interate through the result set.

Yeah, I think I would rather see subselects before I see tree building 
functionality.  Subselects bring a wider basis of ease.

I'm thinking now along the lines of adding a tierlevel field to my table 
design.  In that way I can do 1 query for each tier. Like:

// get top tier
$oRS1 = mysql_query("SELECT ID, Name FROM Projects WHERE TierLevel = 1 
ORDER BY Name") ;
// get second tier
$oRS2 = mysql_query("SELECT ParentID, ID, Name FROM Projects WHERE 
TierLevel = 2 ORDER BY ParentID, Name") ;
// get third tier
$oRS2 = mysql_query("SELECT ParentID, ID, Name FROM Projects WHERE 
TierLevel = 3 ORDER BY ParentID, Name") ;
// get fourth tier
$oRS2 = mysql_query("SELECT ParentID, ID, Name FROM Projects WHERE 
TierLevel = 4 ORDER BY ParentID, Name") ;

Now as I iterate through $oRS1, display Name, I then look at $oRS2, if 
oRS2.ParentID == oRS1.ID, then dip down into iterating $oRS2 until the 
ParentID == something other than oRS1.ID.  At each level the logic would 
be the same.

This would require 1 query per level, and it would require choosing a 
maximum tree depth at design time.  The code might even be simple enough 
to write through a recursive algorithm, although I have yet to attempt 
any recursing in PHP so I'm ignorant if this would be the easiest and 
cleanest way to do it.

Figuring out the level at the time a Project is saved is simple since I 
have a parent ID, I can walk the tree backwards until I get a 0 ParentID 
( 0 is not a legal ProjectID in my design ).  The number of queries I 
had to do plus one would be the level of this new item.

What think ye all?

I'd wrap a class around the whole thing. Use that class to broker
reads and writes to the tree table. Add a "changed" timestamp to the
tree, and have a read from the class only reload the tree from the
database if it's changed since the last read. Stash the object in the
session for reuse, or serialize it to another table (or file, or
whatever) for quick retrieval.

You don't even have to do that. You can just take the level of the
parent node + 1.

or, if you were really lazy,
you could just have a self-referencing table...

tblObjects:
objectID
parentID
fname
lname
etc...

where parentID is the objectID of this object's parent

what's nice about this is, you could query just one table
to find all siblings -- just search for equivalent parentID's.
similarly, it's easy to find orphans and objects that
came before all others -- where parentID = NULL.

That's what I'm doing now, but in order to build the whole tree requires 
multiple queries with this design. My latest idea is to add a tierlevel 
field so I won't have to issue a query for parentID = 0 ( top level ) 
then iterate this result & generate a query for parentID = the id of the 
row we are on in top level etc. right on down the line.  If I have 4 top 
level projects each with 3 sub projects and 1 of the subprojects have 2 
subprojects this would require issuing 1 toplevel query, 4 2nd level 
queries,  12 3rd level queries, and 2 4th level queries.  All told for 
this simple tree I will have issued 19 queries.  If I have a tierlevel 
 I can issue 1 query per allowable tier which would be 4 queries in all 
for a max 4 tierdepth tree.  This would be the same no matter how many 
items I have in the tree, nor how many children etc.

I don't know about the class thing since it adds a level of complexity 
to the code that I don't know
if it's waranted.  I do like the idea of caching the tree though.  I 
would cache it in the DB so that the
tree does not need to be generated at all when the request to display it 
occurs.  The tree would
be regenerated everytime a change occurs to the underlying data ( which 
is a low volume data set )
This may not be a good idea for items that have a higher change velocity.

Hi Hans,
Yes, it is the only error that we get in our little
script im.php: 

"Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imagepng()
in im.php on line 9

 We tried using getimagesize() and some other
gd_functions and they were found by php. 

I do not exaclty understand what you mean by enabling
PNG? We specified PNG directory with the option
"--with" when configuring php. 
What constants should be defined?

Thank you again,
Genevieve.

You can do this without the tierlevel by building dynamic queries of
the form:

(sorry, I forgot your table/column names)

# get the top list first

select node_id, name from tree where parent_id = 0;

# get the results and build list x,y,z of those nodes
# then query for the nodes which have those nodes as parents

select node_id, parent_id, name from tree where parent_id in (x,y,z);

# and so forth.

Those of you (if any) from a manufacturing background will see this as
the way a Bill of Materials (BOM) is built for a product. A product is
built from subassemblies, which are built from either other subs or
individual components (greatly simplified). This is a tried and tested
way of building trees.

I would argue that this will actually make the majority of your code
simpler, because you're encapsulating the complexity. :)

I'm the first to admit that classes aren't appropriate for everything,
but they're the right approach for this kind of stuff.

I'd do something like this:

class tree {
      var nodemap;
      # and whatever else you want

      function tree () {
      # maybe some init code
      }

      function get_tree () {
      # check if tree has changed or isn't populated yet
      # if yes to either, get tree from db
      # otherwise, maybe get tree from intermediate storage if you're
      doing that

      }

      function save_tree () {
      # write tree to db
      }

      function store_tree () {
      # write tree to intermediate storage
      }

      function render_tree () {
      # if tree isn't populated, get tree
      # output tree html or tree values or whatever
      }
      
      function get_tree_values () {
      # return raw node data for the tree
      }
}

Then, in your page:

$mytree = new tree();
$mytree->render_tree();
or
$mytree->get_tree_values();

While I wouldn't advocate this approach for something that changes
once a minute or so, if it changes less than once an hour, this will
probably still result in a performance gain, and it will be easier to
maintain.

As pointed out Oracle has this with the CONNECT TO method.  Alas, this
is one of the biggest misses in MySQL (IMO).

Sure, multiple queries would do it, and depending on the environment
may be the best way.  I've had to tackle similar problems, and found
that a single dynamically generated SQL query is often best.  If you
form the joins properly (LEFT JOIN table ON something=somethingelse)
you can match much of this functionality (I even use it for subselects,
and have only ran into a wall once).

In a for loop, bascially just join the table to itself (or to another
for that matter) with an incrementing aliased name and then set the
criteria at each level in the WHERE clause.  This is all Oracle's
CONNECT TO is doing behind the scenes - you can even maintain a counter
so you know how far each row is "indented."

Here's some code totally ripped from context that probably won't help
at all:

for( $i = 1; $i < count($keys); ++$i) {
   $tag = mysql_escape_string($keys[$i]);
   $select .= ",m$i.mid,m$i.R_mid,m$i.file,m$i.tag,m$i.title";
   $from .= " LEFT JOIN psite.map m$i ON m$i.R_mid=m".($i-1).".mid";
   $where .= " AND m$i.tag='$tag'";
}

$result = mysql_query("SELECT $select FROM $from WHERE $where", $DB);

True, but then I would have to parse the result sets twice each, once to 
get the id's for the next level, the second time to
build the output display.

Yes, I've worked with manufacturing apps, more from the repair 
parts/refurb/warranty repair side.
The database we were working with back then wasn't SQL though it was 
relational.  This allowed
for some interesting permutations you can't do in SQL for trees.

The other reason for avoiding this is my Host Provider would croak if I 
build too much in memory thus hogging the memory shared across many 
sites.  I avoid as much memory use as I can so when I really need it 
it's available.

Well that's a good sign at least.

--with-gd=/path/to/gd  and  --with-png-dir=/path/to/png

(again, I haven't done this in ages, at may be dated info).

Do other image formats/more intensive functions work?  imagejpeg,
imageline, imagegd?

> What constants should be defined?

IMG_PNG, IMAGETYPE_PNG, etc

http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php

Also, are things linked properly? I'm not sure off the cuff how Solaris
does all this, but ldconfig/nm/objdump/ar runs on libphp4.so or php the
binary might show something.

Seems reasonable. I don't know how much memory overhead the class
implementation adds. I wouldn't think too much. Anyone?

Even session variables aren't stored in memory though - they're
written out to temp space on disk (at least, that's how I read the
docs).

I wrote something similar to what you are describing for a personal 
project a while back. On the SQL side it's a pretty simple layout,
every record has a parent id, and from that I can figure out all the 
children by making a quick and dirty index before hand.

Check out (sorry if the url offends) 
http://www.fuck.org/~max/traverse.phps for the example
and http://www.fuck.org/~max/traverse.php for the output.

Sorry if the code is a bit dirty, it's kind of old. =)

This looks to be a simple answer, question is how much memory does it 
consume when dealing with larger amounts of data.  By being able to draw 
the list directly from the result sets, the only memory you are 
consuming is the result set cache's which should not be the whole 
resultset, and the memory for caching the resulting page.  With this 
solution you have all the results held in memory twice, once for 
manipulation, the second for the display cache.

The other thing is for my use, the manipulation would also need to 
include a sort so that your data would display as:

Servers [ID 7] 
- Development [ID 8] 
- - Home Directories [ID 11] 
- Live [ID 10] 
- Staging [ID 9] 
Websites [ID 1] 
- mySQL.com [ID 3] 
- PHP.net [ID 2] 
- - Manual [ID 4] 
- - - Comments [ID 6] 
- - - Functions [ID 5] 

I'll have to look at this further, see if it might be the solution, or part of it.  Thanks.

Agreed that session variables aren't stored in memory between pages, but 
they are fully in memory for the life of every page while the session 
variable exists.  And as a session variable, the space would be consumed 
for each page currently being processed, so for 5 active connections, 
you would have 5 copies in memory.  I've seen discussion of a static 
memory area that can be used to simulate application scoped variables, 
but from what I've seen so far, that solution doesn't seem ready for 
primetime.  By storing the tree in a table, I eliminate the memory 
requirments, It would only be in memory when I need to display the tree 
& will build the display.  The table version of the tree would also be 
very simple since I don't need any linking information, just a key field 
to ensure the proper sortation, and depth indicator so I know how far to 
indent or what graphics to display etc.  

Lastly, from a memory standpoint, I have been burned too many times by 
knowing I work within a constrained environment but then design with 
false assumptions.  Here the assumption is that the memory for the class 
is not that much and that the total size of the tree will not be that 
great.  The first assumption could be answered by the php team, or 
someone else familure with the php memory model and therefore would no 
longer be an assumption.  The second assumption cannot be answered 
without putting a limit on the number of total items to be handled. 
 Putting a limit then creates the next assumption and that is choosing a 
limit everyone can live with for the life of the app ( with the 
assumption as to how long that life is ).  All these assumptions scare 
the crap out of me as a professional software developer because Mr. 
Murphy will screw me in the end.

Please don't take this as a flame, I think you have a great idea, just 
not an idea I think will fit in with what I am comfortable with.

I wouldn't say it's useless ( at least not yet ;-)  ) I just don't have 
the mental capacity left after a day banging on my keyboard, I'll have 
to look at this with a fresh brain ( how do you get one of those anyway? )

My initial knee-jerk response is how do I get what I want through JOINS? 
 That may allow me to connect records together, but in my case I'm 
looking to order the data in a strange ( at least to SQL )way. Unless 
you are looking to create a derived record which contains a string 
encapsulating the whole branch.  If that's the case, then I question 
what the performance would be to parse the results into a displayable 
format.

What did you use to generate the source listing?

Yeah, your right.  Sometimes though encapsulation can be a bad thing 
though when it hides too much and you have to pull your hair out later 
trying to figure out what the heck you did.  There's still too much 
procedural coding in my blood that avoids OOP unless I have to ( as is 
the case with Java ).  In the case of Java and C++, I preceive that the 
performance of the VM/runtime would be better if you were to drop the 
OOP and just go with good old procedural code.  Granted procedural code 
can be messy, but an experienced coder should be able to write modular 
proc code to rival OOP.  Just my own old fart ( 19 years in the business 
I guess qualifies for old fartism in the IT world even though I'm only 
37 ) biased opinion probably not worth admitting!

	Thanks Tim for the insight.  I can see that this is going to take
some re-architecting of my sites.  Perhaps there is a php library around
which does the database abstraction along with checking for redundent
databases in case of primary failure.  I will look around and see what I can
find and post back to the group if anyone is interested.

The way I do this is first, get two web servers running, configured
identical. Keeping them that way can be a chore, but that's another
question.
Use rsync between them to keep your content current. One hole this leaves
is log files, which, to e-commerce sites, may be more important than
content, so I'd look at mysql logging from apache, os that ilk. Mysql
is simple. You can set up 2 replicated servers, but the best way
is to have 3 servers, with the master being where all the writes are
going, and replicated to the slaves, where the reads are done. Now, in
your database code, when you try to attach to your primary slave server,
if that fails, simply try to attach to your 'hot spare' server.

I know this is Perl and LDAP, but it will work the same way in PHP/Mysql.
I just happen to have this code open in my editor:

$ldap=Net::LDAP->new('ldapA.bnl.gov') or
$ldap=Net::LDAP->new('ldapB.bnl.gov') or
$ldap=Net::LDAP->new('ldapC.bnl.gov') or die "$@";

This way, one call should almost always yield a database connection.

I updated the code/source to show a small fix I made which basically
allows you to add a SQL restraint for ordering. So by adding ORDER BY name
ASC it will return the results you said below. How much data are you
talking about? If memory is that big of an issue you may look into caching
the results of your script and only update it when changes are made.

Because there are no application scope variables or the like, I don't
think the decision of whether you do this with classes is mutually
exclusive with the above. You could wrap a class around it, and
serialize/deserialize the tree class to the database as easily as you
could (more easily, in fact, since PHP includes an object
serialization routine, if you wanted to go that route) with straight
db access. Anyway, I think we've beaten this one to death. Good luck!

I don't know what kind of query optimization mysql does, but I'd
suspect not. Even still, you have some extra processing in PHP between
the queries.

However, if performance is your goal, I'd say you should be looking at
HTML caching instead, and not generating the page afresh on each view.

I've been concentrating recently on building reusable components and
frameworks. While this is doable with procedural code, having object
handling makes some of it much easier. In PHP, the lack of private and
protected entities makes this more a syntactical issue than true
encapsulation.

I do, however, find that even the illusion of encapsulation tends to
encourage better code organization.

Subject: displaying a tree defined by one table
Message-ID: <OE52LTrpwACkWHZqYW8000015ba@hotmail.com>

the trees thread made me realize it was a topic near and dear to my heart, since way-back-when i had devoted pretty much an entire day's research-and-development effort towards devising a method of not only creating an arbitrarily-deep tree structure using a single self-referencing table, but also be able to traverse such a structure with relative ease...

my development environment at the time was a windows nt box running coldfusion and access as a db -- so recursion was NOT an option, not only because coldfusion doesn't even support recursion, but also due to the total lack of resources on that puny development box...

call me crazy, but i actually Enjoy developing iterative algorithms for problems that usually lend themselves to recursion, especially when even brainstorming such an iterative solution would send most developers screaming out the door in search of fresh air and daylight.

anyways, porting my coldfusion script to php proved extremely rudimentary.

i created a basic table for this exercise, called "test"
it has three fields -- id [int], parent_id [int], and name [varchar(64)]
there's an index on id (primary) and parent_id

contents of "test":

id, parent_id, name

3, 0, primary1
2, 0, primary2
1, 0, primary3
5, 3, secondary1
6, 3, secondary2
4, 1, secondary3
7, 5, tertiary1
8, 4, tertiary2
9, 4, tertiary3


my assumption here is that
a top-level item's parent_id is to be zero.
(i could have just as easily used NULL.)


the code to display this tree:
----


<?php

$mc = mysql_connect("localhost") or die("!mysql_connect");
$md = mysql_select_db("mysql",$mc) or die("!mysql_select_db");

$mq = mysql_query("SELECT id, parent_id, name FROM test ORDER BY name") or die("!mysql_query");
$nrows = mysql_num_rows($mq);

$data = array_fill(0,$nrows,NULL);
$n = 0;
while($mfa = mysql_fetch_array($mq,MYSQL_ASSOC))
 $data[$n++] = $mfa;

mysql_free_result($mq);
mysql_close($mc);

$id_list = array();
$row_list = array();
$depth_list = array();

for($n = 0 ; $n < $nrows ; $n++)
 if($data[$n]["parent_id"] == 0)
 { array_push($id_list,$data[$n]["id"]);
  array_push($row_list,$n);
  array_push($depth_list,0);
 }

while(count($id_list) < $nrows)
{ $id_temp = array();
 $row_temp = array();
 $depth_temp = array();
 for($i = 0 ; $i < count($id_list) ; $i++)
 { $id = $id_list[$i];
  $row = $row_list[$i];
  $depth = $depth_list[$i];
  array_push($id_temp,$id);
  array_push($row_temp,$row);
  array_push($depth_temp,$depth);
  for($j = 0 ; $j < $nrows ; $j++)

SQL deals in result sets and is unfortunately not a good tool for working 
with directed graphs, of which trees are one such data structure.  I've 
been working casually on this for a couple of years without much 
success.  There are alternative methods of representing trees in SQL as 
nested sets, or at least it's possible in Oracle.  But it's not 
pretty.  Here's a Joe Celko article I've archived, which is the best I've 
found on the topic of generating trees with SQL:

performance isn't my goal other than the general attempt to choose the 
best performing solution within all the other constraints. When I was 
project lead on many projects at my old business, it saddened me to see 
how many programmers forget that performance needs to be a thought in 
everything we do lest we produce a great solution but a cludge on 
resources and performance.  Without performance as a backthought in all 
your decisions, you can also produce a great solution in testing but 
performs horibly when put under load, or when the load grows as most 
businesses hope.

So far, the performance of my app is stunning, and this is over the web. 
 I've been very happy with the performance of PHP when it comes to page 
building.

reusable modules are always your best candidate for OOP.  In this 
situation, the implementation details are only important at the time of 
module development or improvement.  For the consumer of the module, the 
interface is all that matters.  And yes, your right, this can also be 
done with procedural code, you produce your module as a seperate file, 
each procedure's call interface clearly documented, all data passed as 
procedure arguments.

There's also no argument from me that OOP encourages better code 
organization.  With procedural code you can make a real mess, OOP 
provides the organizational framework so your potential for a mess is 
lower.  I don't want to sound all doom and gloom on OOP, but I don't 
think it really is all that it's hyped up to be.  If I could get the 
same performance out of OOP code as I can out of proc code, I wouldn't 
care.  It just seems that OOP has become the be all and end all of 
development in most developers minds without even questioning it's 
benefit or seeing it's downside.  I also don't like a half implemented 
OOP.  I was first introed to OOP in the early days of PowerBuilder.  I 
had an acedemic understanding of OOP from C++, but PB was where I got my 
feet wet.  I initially produced some pretty nasty code, mostly because 
PB allowed both proc code and OOP.  It took a while for me to realize 
that with OOP, the more OOPish my code, the more I would reap the 
benefits of OOP.  By the time I got into Java, I had it down pat, and 
loved the fact that Java forced me all OOP so I couldn't get careless 
and go back to the half breed code I was originally producing in PB.

I guess in the case of PHP, as with ASP/JavaScript/VBScript, I don't 
like the OOP/proc mix.  I guess I also don't like a half implemented OOP 
where key features of OOP are missing.  I've only been working with PHP 
for about a year now and only the past 6 months or so with real 
development.  I also don't have any paying projects yet in PHP so my PHP 
time is only a fraction of my dev time.  I have yet to really dive into 
the OOP side of PHP so you never know, I might find I like it and flip 
all my stuff over to OOP.  I do know that I have some stuff in my 
existing app that could really benefit from inheritance.

Hey, thanks, I recalled reading the Celco articles on trees years ago, 
didn't know they could still be obtained, thanks.  This may be my best 
bet yet.  Celco can be deep reading, but worth it in the end.  Just a 
perusal of this article and the ensuing 2 shows that Celco put a lot of 
thought into it which allows doing this tree stuff at the SQL Server end 
in standard SQL without burdening the application.  Just grab the data, 
iterate for display.  This is the kind of solution I was looking for. 
 Thanks big time.  Now if I can just understand all the in's and out's 
of Celco's stuff...

Subject: RFC: I'm building a data management framework
Message-ID: <20021017171046.GJ1146@eye.surgam.net>

The following is a high level description of a general system I'm
currently building. I'd love to get some feedback on whether such a
thing is interesting to you, and what features you'd like to see.

----------

Starting from a user perspective, there are a few levels, and at each
level you define the behavior of the system with an XML file (or
generate one from some interactive choices).

At the lowest level, you define datasets, which are made up of fields,
each of which has a data types. Each data set corresponds to a table
in the database, and each field you want to manage must be listed in
the description. I've imposed some restrictions on the structure of
the tables (this makes things a lot easier to dynamically manage, and
corresponds to my style in making relational databases, and I don't
think it's too restrictive, but I'm open to suggestions) :

- currently, you must use mysql. This will change eventually.

- each table must have an autogenerated primary key, named
"<tablename>_id"

- each table must have an integer field called "status"

- foreign keys must have the same field name in both tables

- if you want to support versions, each table must have a
corresponding table called "<tablename>_updates" with id, object
(blob) structure.

Field types correspond to commonly used html structures - text,
textarea, select (you can either specify the options in the definition
or specify a table to read name/value pairs from), date (which pops up
a calendar), image (which gives you a file choose box and saves the
uploaded file on disk).

Relations to other tables are handled in two ways - there's a field
type called "contains" that takes a data set as a parameter. Also,
data set types are supported - currently, I support "item" and
"relation". Item datasets represent single-item tables, which may
reference other tables with contains fields (1:n) relations. Relation
datasets represent n:n mapping tables and must contain references to
exactly two item datasets.

There's a script which will read the xml files and output the db
creation SQL (or connect to the database directly and just do
it). 

So... you've got all these datasets, which represent a relational
database structure. The system defines ways to operate on the
datasets, which are represented currently either by a single-screen or
a two-screen form and form handler. It doesn't currently support field
validation, but because of the structure, it would be fairly easy to
add. So for editing, all you do is hand the renderer a dataset name,
an appropriate mode, and an id for an existing item (unless you're
adding a new one), and it gives you a dynamically generated form for
doing so, based on your data definition. It also lets you do some
traversal of the relations to edit other connected items.

There's a dynamic display component as well, but the details are in
progress.

Any thoughts?

Message-ID: <OE45HkidcDjoYAPNXRP00001ada@hotmail.com>

the trees thread made me realize it was a topic near and dear to my heart,
since way-back-when i had devoted pretty much an entire day's
research-and-development effort towards devising a method of not only
creating an arbitrarily-deep tree structure using a single self-referencing
table, but also be able to traverse such a structure with relative ease...

my development environment at the time was a windows nt box running
coldfusion and access as a db -- so recursion was NOT an option, not only
because coldfusion doesn't even support recursion, but also due to the total
lack of resources on that puny development box...

call me crazy, but i actually Enjoy developing iterative algorithms for
problems that usually lend themselves to recursion, especially when even
brainstorming such an iterative solution would send most developers
screaming out the door in search of fresh air and daylight.

anyways, porting my coldfusion script to php proved extremely rudimentary.

i created a basic table for this exercise, called "test"
it has three fields -- id [int], parent_id [int], and name [varchar(64)]
there's an index on id (primary) and parent_id

contents of "test":

id, parent_id, name

3, 0, primary1
2, 0, primary2
1, 0, primary3
5, 3, secondary1
6, 3, secondary2
4, 1, secondary3
7, 5, tertiary1
8, 4, tertiary2
9, 4, tertiary3


my assumption here is that
a top-level item's parent_id is to be zero.
(i could have just as easily used NULL.)


the code to display this tree:
----


<?php

$mc = mysql_connect("localhost") or die("!mysql_connect");
$md = mysql_select_db("mysql",$mc) or die("!mysql_select_db");

$mq = mysql_query("SELECT id, parent_id, name FROM test ORDER BY name") or
die("!mysql_query");
$nrows = mysql_num_rows($mq);

$data = array_fill(0,$nrows,NULL);
$n = 0;
while($mfa = mysql_fetch_array($mq,MYSQL_ASSOC))
 $data[$n++] = $mfa;

mysql_free_result($mq);
mysql_close($mc);

$id_list = array();
$row_list = array();
$depth_list = array();

for($n = 0 ; $n < $nrows ; $n++)
 if($data[$n]["parent_id"] == 0)
 { array_push($id_list,$data[$n]["id"]);
  array_push($row_list,$n);
  array_push($depth_list,0);
 }

while(count($id_list) < $nrows)
{ $id_temp = array();
 $row_temp = array();
 $depth_temp = array();
 for($i = 0 ; $i < count($id_list) ; $i++)
 { $id = $id_list[$i];
  $row = $row_list[$i];
  $depth = $depth_list[$i];
  array_push($id_temp,$id);
  array_push($row_temp,$row);
  array_push($depth_temp,$depth);
  for($j = 0 ; $j < $nrows ; $j++)
   if(($data[$j]["parent_id"] == $id)
   && (array_search($data[$j]["id"],$id_list) == NULL))
   { array_push($id_temp,$data[$j]["id"]);
    array_push($row_temp,$j);
    array_push($depth_temp,$depth + 1);
   }
 }
 $id_list = $id_temp;
 $row_list = $row_temp;
 $depth_list = $depth_temp;
}

print('<pre>');
for($n = 0 ; $n < $nrows ; $n++)
 print(str_repeat("----",$depth_list[$n]) . $data[$row_list[$n]]["name"] .

I was playing around with this awhile back also. I always thought that 
you could send XML back and forth, and when it landed on various 
servers, it would create the database's for you. Sort of a viral-db 
thing...  But of course then I became unemployed... :-)

Message-ID: <20021017185045.GA12191@eye.surgam.net>

This is one of those really easy questions that's difficult to search
for because the search terms look like everything else.

Is there an easy way to do simple variable interpolation on a string?

For example, if I have:

$one = '1';
$two = '= $one';

Is there a way to get $two to equal '= 1' (or whatever $one happens to
contain, obviously)?

To clarify, I don't want $two to equal $one. I want $two to equal some
string that has a bunch of other characters and the value of $one. So
if the original $two string was:

'this string = $one and that is it'

I want it to be:

'this string = 1 and that is it'

after processing.

I believe

 $two = "= " . $one;

will do it.

    Good luck

It does. But it assumes I don't already have the string literal value
of $two. Suppose I want to read in a string from a file or db that is
stored as "= $one" and I want to interpolate it after reading it?

How do I do that?

Hm.. "= $one" is not a variable.. I don't know how you would treat it as one. I think you might be able to do something with 'variable variables'.

Just to make sure everything is clear to Adam:

Only strings inside double quotes get evaluated.  Strings inside single
quotes are taken literally.

So:

 $one = 1;
 $two = "this string = $one and that is it";
 echo $two;
 [results:  this string = 1 and that is it]

 $one = 1;
 $two = 'this string = $one and that is it';
 echo $two;
 [results:  this string = $one and that is it]

I didn't find anything useful in there.

However, this works. It's not particularly elegant, but it does what I
want:

--------------
$i = 0;
foreach (explode(' ', $test) as $word) {
  if (substr($word, 0, 1) == '$') {
    $newstring[$i] = eval ("return $word;");
  } else {
    $newstring[$i] = $word;
  }
  $i++;
}
print join(' ', $newstring);
--------------

Assuming that $test is my source string.

Yes, I'm fully aware of that. That was not my question.

That is also not my question. I don't want to know how to assign a
string such that variable interpolation happens. I want to know how to
take an existing string and perform variable interpolation on it. I
posted my solution already, but I'm still wondering if there's a
better way.

For completeness sake, here it is again (this does what I want, given
an existing string):

$i = 0;
foreach (explode(' ', $test) as $word) {
  if (substr($word, 0, 1) == '$') {
    $newstring[$i] = eval ("return $word;");
  } else {
    $newstring[$i] = $word;
  }
  $i++;
}
print join(' ', $newstring);

Oh.  I didn't understand your question.  Guess I was too busy working on 
other things to really pay attention to the whole thread.  Max was on 
target with eval().  So, continuing with my example...

  $one = 1;
  $two = 'this string = $one and that is it';
  $three = eval($two);
  echo $three;
  [results:  this string = 1 and that is it]

Now, BE CAREFUL about using eval().  You could do some really nasty things 
if the incoming string is corrupted by nasty persons.  Please read the PHP 
manual about eval() to make sure you're being safe.

That actually wouldn't work, in order to do eval() you must pass it a 
valid piece of code, so at runtime your code would return a parse error 
as it would be the same as a line of code that said 'this string = $one 
and that is it', where as '\\$string = $one;' would parse.

Earlier I gave the answer:

$one = '1';
$two = '$one';
eval("\\$result = \\"$two\\";");
echo $result;

Which would work fine, but you are very correct about the safety and it 
is a bad idea to eval anything coming in from user input without a huge 
load of data integrity checking.

Why explode and rejoin instead of just one eval?

$foo = eval("return '$foo';");

You might need to addslashes() on $foo first:

$safe = addslashes($foo);
$foo  = eval("return '$safe';");

This is one of those really easy questions that's difficult to search
for because the search terms look like everything else.

Is there an easy way to do simple variable interpolation on a string?

For example, if I have:

$one = '1';
$two = '= $one';

Is there a way to get $two to equal '= 1' (or whatever $one happens to
contain, obviously)?

Oops, those should be doublequotes inside the eval:

$foo = eval("return \\"$foo\\";");

and

$safe = addcslashes($foo,'"');
$foo  = eval("return \\"$safe\\";");

Oh, dear.  You're right.  I so rarely use eval() I forgot about that.  
Once again, haste makes waste.

Kris,

Yes, it was received.  Sorry I didn't comment on it, been busy with trying
to make some money and the Celco solution seemed more like what I was
looking for.  Your solution puts the work burden on the application, Celco's
on the DBMS.  I've found in most cases, if it can be done through a query,
do it through a query, that is usually the best performing, least resource
intense aproach.  It also scales well as the tree grows both in items and in
depth.

Jim

PS.  I see your in Hoboken, wish I could offer you a job, but I'm still too
small at this point.

If you're on the WWWAC list, I'd also suggest talking with Andrew Gideon of 
TAG Online.  He and I had a fairly extensive offline message discussion on 
the subject of SQL and trees last year.  He has something like the Celko 
solution already running with some threaded discussion software he wrote 
and I believe he's the guy who referred me to those Celko articles.

ah, ok.
thanks!

yeah i'm kinda curious myself how my solution would scale...
i've used it in the past (when it was a coldfusion script) with as many as a
hundred nested categories linked data items, and pretty successfully, but
haven't done any stress-testing.

anyways glad the list got the message - it's definately handy for use on
dbms' that aren't that great at handling many queries at once (i.e. Access -
ugh :)

actually...

Yes, but I am persuing the design proposed by Celco since it is a mostly DB

The sections you'll need to focus on there are A.7 (checkout), A.8 
(commit) and A.16 (update).

Hey, what a coincidence, I just started using it and like it a lot. 
CVS is quite nice, but you really need to wrap your mind around it.

I have bought the O'Reilly Pocket Reference on CVS and it helped me 
to figure out CVS.

I got an interface project, but I never be an interface programmer, I think a lot of people out there could know this or could give me some hints, here is my problem:
I have one text field and a button,  if user want to ask for another text field, user just simply click on the button, then another text field will be generate right after the previous text filed,  user can generate unlimited fields, this function should work for both IE5.0+ and Netcape4.0+.
like this:
                                         -------------------------          ----------------------------------------
 Enter your account    :       |                         |         |click if you have more accts|
                                         --------------------------          -----------------------------------------
when user click on "click if you have more accounts", another text filed will be generate right on the next line. 
I know it will use Javascript, also some knowledge about windows DOM structure, I didn't find some similar website, could you give me some hints? or give me a website using this kind of text fileds.
sorry it is not a PHP question.
Thank you for your help!

My experience with javascript is when you click a button to execute a
javascript function to output HTML it will refresh the page.

You could try creating the page with multiple textboxes with only the
first one visible and if they want to add more then add it by making the
next one visible; this would also include the text as well.  Not sure if
text can be switched between visible and not visible (visible = true /
false), probably though would use the text color as long as the background
was a single color.

Of course the drawback with this method is that you would have to have a
finite set of textboxes . . .  but you could always add another button
that would allow the user to enter "more".

Hope this helps.  I'm just trying to give a quick answer based on what I
can remember.

Mark,

    Everytime the button is pushed send the form back to a PHP script on 
the server and have it rebuild the page with another text box. You might 
also want to store the first text field in a "hidden" variable in the 
page and also print the name to the screen as text. You can continue to 
add features in the php script depending on what is submitted and how 
fancy you want to get.

    There is probably an easier answer but this way you do not have to 
worry about the client's js abilities, other than displaying the form.

    Good luck,

        Russ

I have lots of places where I need this functionality, but I perform it at
the
server via whatever my server technology is.  When the "ADD" button is
detected on the server, it recreates the page with the form data, with 1
extra line of data entry.  This allows for an unlimited number of lines and
eliminates the cross browser issues.  Since I know this page will be
reloading multiple times, I attempt all the page performance helps I can
add like use of a seperate CSS and hand optimized HTML.

In Explorer 5 and Netscape 6 you can actually create elements on the fly
and insert them anywhere in your document. I've done this successfully
with tables and table rows. I'm not sure if this works for all html
elements, but give it a try.

This is a way it works with tables:

Let's say I have a div tag in my html document like this:
<div id="placeHolder"></div>

With JavaScript I can create a table element like this:
var newTable = document.createElement("table");
newTable.width = "300";
newTable.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
newTable.border = 1;

I can then append the table to the html document like this:
var x = document.getElementById("placeHolder");
x.appendChild(newTable);

Of course, with tables I also have to create and append all the table
elements.

hope this helps,
Jose

Thanks for all, actually I can't use hide fields since there is a number limit, also I can't use server side script since there are heavy loads on servers, I know server side is safe and will work absolutely, but I try to resolve it on client side.
Hi Jose, 
Could you give me one or more websites using the way you said here? I think that is the way I am looking, I remembered one was on Ebay, but it was removed recently.
Thanks for all!

Hello Mark,

As the others have pointed out, there are basically three ways of adding 
form elements to the page:

1) The first one is an immediate addition to the page of a certain 
element. This can be accomplished in version 5.0 + browsers (IE 5+, 
Netscape 6+)  using the W3C Document Object Model specification and 
JavaScript. This page by Peter-Paul Koch explains how to dynamically add 
a table row ( tr ) to a table. 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ppk/js/tablefun.html  . I am sure a similar thing 
can be accomplished with form input  and select | option elements. In 
this case, you are really adding or removing elements from a page. A 
good introduction to the DOM and its uses can be found at mozilla.org : 
http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_intro.html . Although adding 
and removing elements this way can be tedious, it is one way of doing it.

2)You create, say, 10 form elements on the page, and "hide" 9 of them, 
by using a snippet of JavaScript which will set those 9 to be invisible. 
So, for example, you could have something like (I left the lesser than 
and greater than signs out)
  input class="elem0" value="something 0"
  input class="elem1" value="something 1"
  ...
  input class="elem8" value="something 8"

and then on your page you link the stylesheet mystyle.css in the head 
section, whose contents look like this:

input.elem0 { display:inline; }
input.elem1 { display:none; }
...
input.elem8 { display:none; }

thus all elements except the first are hidden when the page loads. Then, 
using a JavaScript snippet, you can selectively make others visible.
I have only tried this with paragraphs ( the P tag) so I am not sure if 
this wil work.

The code for hiding and unhiding elements can be found here:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ppk/js/blockinvi.html

and also:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~ppk/js/display.html

The important difference between hiding elements here is that there are 
still there - you just can't see them. In the first example, with the 
DOM you can really remove the elements, so they are gone.

3) Another solution - and appropriate for this discussion group - is 
using JavaScript to redirect your page (and the chose elements) to a PHP 
processing script, which will figure out what the user has chosen so 
far, and build extra form elements to the page, before submitting it 
back. The benefit of this is that older browsers (such as Netscape 4.x) 
will be able to use the form you made, because they cannot handle the 
advanced DOM add/remove of elements, and can barely handle the hiding 
/unhiding stuff.

I hope this helps. If you need more specific code, please let me know.

Kind Regards,

- Jay

Hi Mark,

I put together a page that I think does what you need:
http://www.third-frame.com/toolbox/dynamic_fields.html

I tested this on IE6 and NN6. I think it should also work on IE5. It
definitely doesn't work on NN4.

for contract work starting immediately. Initial project is a dynamic backend 
for an existing front end, involving media downloads/uploads and
database connectivity. Must have 2+ years of experience, and more 
specifically, must be highly proficient or at least knowledgeable in the
following issues:
- best practices for connecting to a database and performing database
related logic;

procedures);
- methods of authenticating clients before allowing downloads, as well as
accepting uploads;
- audio processing via PHP modules;
- connecting to third party HTTP services via PHP.

Additionally, candidates must have had experience building related projects
for massively scalable and robust implementations, and must have
well-organized and commented coding techniques. Candidates should also be

Subject: Programmer needed
Message-ID: <20021024222103.11293.qmail@web40312.mail.yahoo.com>

The company I'm working for is looking for a contract programmer in the
New York area.  The project will begin next Wednesday, by all
indications, and will involve PHP and mySQL programming.  They're using
Postnuke for a CMS and want to create customized sections that tap into
Postnuke session variables, so familiarity with the inner workings of
that CMS is a big, big plus. Some light travel within the NY area is
required but will be fully reimbursed, and they tell me that the pay
will be competitive.

Reply to me off-list with relevant links and any information you wish
to pass along.

Thank you.

Subject: Executing from the command line
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210260325440.12326-100000@www.1hp.net>

Hello,
I'm trying to run a program from the command line using the passthru()
function. I'm using phptriad on an NT machine. I can get the passthru()
function to execut basic DOS commands like "dir" etc, but as soon as I try
to execute a program, my browser spins. I'm adding an extra layer even, by
running the program through a c command line parser that I wrote. Still no
good. The command line argument is executed, but it starts a rogue process
or something because the programs are running in my task manager, but the
browser never comes back.

So this is quite a situation for me now... I'm wondering if anyone has
experience running command lines from a PHP page.

Thanks a lot!
Clay

For your reference, here is my php code:

<?php

print("Click the button to execute SilkTest locally<br>");
print("<form action=\\"test.php\\" method=post>\
");
print("<input type=hidden value=1 name=go>\
");
print("<input type=submit>\
");
print("</form>\
");

if($go == 1){
	//execute local c program
	//$command = "sys_run.exe
c://progra~1/Segue/SilkTest/partner.exe";
	//$command = "/apache/htdocs/pats/sys_run.exe
/progra~1/Segue/SilkTest/partner.exe -r
/apache/htdocs/pats/pats_individual_template.t > output.txt";
	$command = "/apache/htdocs/pats/sys_run.exe
/progra~1/Segue/SilkTest/partner.exe -q -resexport -r
/apache/htdocs/pats/pats_testplan.pln";
	//$command = "/apache/htdocs/pats/sys_run.exe
/progra~1/Segue/SilkTest/partner.exe";
	//$command = "/apache/htdocs/pats/sys_run.exe dir"; //works
	//$return = exec($command);
   //$return = system($command);

	//$return = exec("c://progra~1/Segue/SilkTest/partner.exe -r
c://apache/htdocs/pats/pats_individual_template.t");
	print("<pre>");
		passthru($command);
	print("</pre>");
}

?>

and here is my c program sys_run.c that is using a system() command with
the parsed
arguments in argv[]:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
	int a, b, c;
	char CmdLn[5200];

	if(argc < 2){
		printf("please specify a system command (with optional
arguments) as an argument");
		return 0;
	}

	printf("argc = %d\
", argc);

	for(a=1, b=2, c=argc; b<=c; a++, b++){
		if(b == 2){
			strcpy(CmdLn, argv[a]);
			strcat(CmdLn, " ");
		}
		if( (b > 2) && (b < c) ){
			strcat(CmdLn, argv[a]);
			strcat(CmdLn, " ");
		}
		if(b == c){
			strcat(CmdLn, argv[a]);
		}
		printf("loop: CmdLn = %s\
", CmdLn);
	}

	//"c://progra~1/Segue/SilkTest/partner.exe -r
c://apache/htdocs/pats/pats_individual_template.t"

	printf("final: CmdLn = %s\
", CmdLn);

	system(CmdLn);

	return 0;
}

Good evening,

Last week's presentation material from Daniel is now online at
http://nyphp.org/presentations/

If anyone notices any errors, please let me know.  Also, there were
several good links and points made during the presentation, and I
noticed some people were taking notes as well.  Please send me any
useful notes and I'll add them to the presentation so others may see
them.

Thank you,

Subject: unserialize_callback_func
Message-ID: <20021028021648.GF14105@eye.surgam.net>


I'm trying to use unserialize_callback_func to set up an autoloader
function to be called if an object is unserialized and the class
hasn't been defined yet.

However, it doesn't seem to work - the callback function isn't getting
called.

I tried ini_set and setting the value explicitly in the php.ini, but
it doesn't call the function.

Drawing on the example from the docs:

-------------------
function __unser($class)
{
  die ("Callback");
}
ini_set('unserialize_callback_func','__unser');
$serialized_object='O:1:"a":1:{s:5:"value";s:3:"100";}';
print_r (unserialize($serialized_object));
-------------------

should print "Callback", but instead, it prints (as expected without
the callback) "Array ( ) __PHP_Incomplete_Class Object (
[__PHP_Incomplete_Class_Name] => a [value] => 100 ) ".

Has anyone used this successfully?

Also, assuming there's a way to do this, does anyone know if this
callback can be a class method for a singleton class instead of a
regular function?

Does anyone know a good hosting company with php and mysql support.
It should be either free or cheap since I am a student. I need to use it

jtlnet.com has pretty decent prices and a very high speed network which makes it ideal for small sites.

I have a freind who runs www.hostvelocity.com which provides quite cheap
hosting with php and mysql support.  Check it out, and if you sign up, let
Stephen know that Jim Hendricks with Biz Computing made the recommendation.

No problems with their service. They will even create a custom plan for

Thought you all would get a hoot out of this:

So, how many of you who are LAMP are also Java as Sun seems to think?

I'll start by saying I'm a Java programmer who has added LAMP/WAMP to my

Start at $5/month. I've been we cornerhost.com for six months and I'm 
more than satisfied.

Now that we've heard all (1) of the realy cheap places to host your AMP
site (2), does anyone have recommendations for ISPs that are good for
fully or partially managed servers?  co-location?  I work for a small dev
shop, and we are constantly shuttling between all of these little
companies to fine a good deal.  

I've been trying to persuade the group to invest in a managed or a colo
server recently.  One of our clients has a managed server with AT&T.  The
service is impeccable, but the price tag is close to $5k/month which is a
little high.  I would appreciate all of your responses.  I've done some
research myself, but all of these companies say they do the same thing
with a varying array of pricing structures.

So tell me your experiences with these guys. 


Thanks in advance,

Jim Bishop

As always, the right tool for the right job. PHP and Java are >not<
competitors. I'm finding that PHP is, in addition to being a decent
open application platform, an appropriate tool for rapid prototyping
of Java applications. As long as you use classes, it's not terribly
difficult to port PHP apps to Java.

This would be made much much easier with two features which PHP lacks
(which have just become my top two feature requests):

1) Server-side request forwarding.

2) Private and protected instance variables.

I believe www.hostvelocity.com does co-lo, but I don't know what his prices
are etc. for that since I go with just the hosting service.  I also know
that Host Velocity also does service reselling so if NYPHP wanted to provide
hosting service, they could be a Host Velocity reseller and not have to
worry about the majority of the headache of managing the hosting.

A client of mine uses Pair for a dedicated server.  They've been pretty 
responsive.  No major snafus.

I work for Datapipe.. (www.datapipe.com). Although we do colo, it's not our specialty. We do provide dedicated, security managed (we apply all security related patches without you having to do anything), and fully managed ( you tell us what to do and it will get done immediately).

We provide both Unix and Windows based solutions and have very knowladgeable support personnel for both. (I was one of those hehe).
Anyway. Let me know if you have any questions or would like a contact name from our sales department.

I found the problem. Apparently, this setting doesn't exist in
versions prior to 4.2, and the documentation listing applicable
versions is wrong.

Yeah, I'm using this right now.  The example looks like it should work,
however consider a couple things:
  -- Drop the underscores from the function's name (use a plain-jane
function name initially for testing).
  -- Instead of die() in the callback, use trigger_error(), as dieing
might not act as expected when within a callback.

Not sure, but I can't think of why not.

Can you tell if the program is ever getting executed?  Maybe you have
some path/permission problems?

I'm not sure about NT so much, but popen() and proc_open() may work
better for you.

If the program expects input from stdin or output via stderr/stdout
you'll need to write/read, otherwise it will hang with either an empty
or filled buffer.  This is where popen() might be good, or better yet,
proc_open() if available.

i use ControlQuest (www.cqhost.com) to host my site (krisgale.com)
and i haven't even begun to tap all the features they offer...
for $12.50 a month you get 100mb storage, a mysql db, and
support for just about every scripting language + platform
you can imagine...  php (4.22), jsp (resin 2.14 and jdk 1.4),
asp (chilisoft + spicepack), frontpage extensions, coldfusion (mx),
and php (4.22)... you can use all of these interchangably from
the same shared volume - i honestly don't know how they got
all six coexisting peacefully on the same config but it does make
for one hell of a development/test suite...
besides the $12.50 a month "cherokee" server, they have
plans ranging from there for more corporate purposes...
it's been my experience that they respond to trouble tickets
Quite rapidly, and are even technical enough to read YOUR
source code to offer help and possible solutions to problems...
i recommend them without hesitation.

Subject: CQHost and JSP vs. PHP
Message-ID: <F188luLCTaogxLDp7mv0000011e@hotmail.com>

I had an extremely bad experience with CQHost.  Poor uptime, poor 
communication.  My site was down for days at a time.

I was drawn to CQHost by the JSP support (and, in fact, I'm writing a JSP 
version of LiquidClassifiedsXML right now - and have nowhere to host it, now 
that I'm letting my CQHost account expire).

Ever wonder why PHP support is widely available while JSP support is offered 
by relatively few hosts on hosting plans that cost less than $15/month? 
(even though JSP appears to be far more popular with employers)

CQHost blamed its uptime problems on Resin, which it said was causing 
resource utilization problems.  This seems plausible enough to me - I can 
see that with client-side apps that Java tends to be a memory and processor 
hog, and I believe that it behaves similarly on the server-side (see 
http://www.chamas.com/bench/index.html and look, especially, at the red bars 
indicating memory usage).

But I don't want to give the appearance of claiming that PHP is good while 
JSP is bad.

My belief is that PHP tends to be better suited for small websites/companies 
while JSP/servlets/EJBs tend to be better suited for large 
websites/companies, particularly ones for which data loss or downtime can 
have catastrophic implications.

I would use JSP/servlets/EJBs if I needed things like failover and message 
queueing - probably important if I am processing trades.  I wouldn't want to 
lose a few Soros Fund trades just because the server went down temporarily 
(rather, I'd like them to go into a message queue, to be processed later 
when the server comes back up).

I would use PHP if I needed to make a quick and cheap website that primarily 
serves information as opposed to processing financial transactions.

But this is just my opinion; no doubt, lots of people on this list will 
disagree with me.

And I'll note, before other people point this out, that at least one large 
company appears to be adopting PHP: 
http://public.yahoo.com/~radwin/talks/yahoo-phpcon2002.htm

But as far as I can tell, the major Wall Street firms are big 
JSP/servlet/EJB users rather than PHP users.

Large companies may choose JSP simply because Sun is a publicly traded
company that sells enterprise scale servers with JSP included and provides
active support for their products.  Brand name goes a long way in the
corporate world -- "What company is behind PHP?  Trust our sensitive data
and transactions to an open source product? We should stick with what we
know."  In trying to convince a company to migrate to a LAMP server I was
recentky asked those very questions, so until IBM, Corel and the other "big
names" make some headway in their Linux campaigns, big business as a whole
may not be ready for PHP.

Hi folks,

This isn't so much a problem with PHP, but I hope someone can help out
with some JavaScript issues I'm having.

With IE6 (this app only needs to support IE6) I have Window 1 (main
browser window) and Window 2 (popup).  The user enters some information
into the popup and submits the form, which PHP then processes and sends
a header('Location: http://somewhere/whatever'); back to the popup.

The problem is, I need to get the parent window (Window 1) to be
redirected, while the popup (Window 2) closes.  Any ideas on how to
either:

1) Have the popup send it's new location (from the PHP form processor)
back to it's parent.

2) Or, have the parent see where the popup would be redirected to, and
redirect itself?

3) Or something else.

I've looked at MS's JScript and DOM/etc pages, but I don't see anything
useful.  If this isn't possible (I suppose it could be a security
problem) I'll have to figure some other way of doing it.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, as I'm about to go back to
text-based browsers :)

Thanks,

H

It's not worth all the support calls for less than $15 :)
Seriously.. you mentioned that JSP/Servlets is more popular with employees. My observation is that people who want to deal with JSP/Servlets/Java are ready to pay the price for it. Because you actually do need faster hardware and much much more support.

I don't know if I follow your problem correctly, but if I do, here's what I
do:

I never have a popup submit to the server, the form button on the popup
always passes the data from the popup form to the parent window form
through hidden fields, then submits on the parent and closes itself.

Is this any help?

Jim

I use this for reloading the base window and closing the popup. I
can't think of any reason why you couldn't use something similar to
redirect the base window to another url.

Basically, I have a generic save page that detects if it was called as
a popup (right now, I pass this value in, but I should probably
ultimately be getting it from the browser). If not, it reloads itself
to some other appropriate url (I'm working on a system for carrying a
stack of jumpback urls through a window thread - it's not quite there
yet). If yes, then it does this:

  print '<script language="javascript">';
  print 'opener.location.reload();';
  print 'self.close();';
  print '</script>';

Or were you looking for something else?

Have you tried something like writing some javascript to the popup page when it reloads that redirects the main window and closes the popup.  Something like: 
  
window.opener.location.href  = '<new_location>'; //sends window1 to new location 
window.close(); //closes window2

Hi folks, 

This isn't so much a problem with PHP, but I hope someone can help out 
with some JavaScript issues I'm having. 

With IE6 (this app only needs to support IE6) I have Window 1 (main 
browser window) and Window 2 (popup). The user enters some information 
into the popup and submits the form, which PHP then processes and sends 
a header('Location: http://somewhere/whatever'); back to the popup. 

The problem is, I need to get the parent window (Window 1) to be 
redirected, while the popup (Window 2) closes. Any ideas on how to 
either: 

1) Have the popup send it's new location (from the PHP form processor) 
back to it's parent. 

2) Or, have the parent see where the popup would be redirected to, and 
redirect itself? 

3) Or something else. 

I've looked at MS's JScript and DOM/etc pages, but I don't see anything 
useful. If this isn't possible (I suppose it could be a security 
problem) I'll have to figure some other way of doing it. 

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, as I'm about to go back to 
text-based browsers :) 

Thanks, 

H

Well, it certainly seems like it would solve the problem (ie, the
parent window would be doing the actual submitting to the server, and
thus would get the redirect properly).  However, I had no idea that you
could submit one window to another :)  By chance could you post (attach
a text file if it'd be messy in an email) a quick example?

Thanks Jim,

You could do something like:
<body onLoad="opener.location.href = [result location URL];self.close();">
in the result page sent to the pop-up.  This would only work, of course, if
you can just get the href, and not the entire header (leaving off the
"Location:" chunk).

here's some ideas that will work with browsers as ancient or as fresh as you
choose to use...

as someone else suggested (deleted the message already or else i'd give
credit where it's due), you could duplicate the form fields somewhere in the
parent as hidden fields, and create an onsubmit handler in the child that
does nothing more than copy the .value's of its form fields to the parent's
hidden ones, does a .submit() of the form in the parent, and closes itself
via self.close().

OR

if you are determined to have the popup submit itself, and then redirect the
parent as needed, you could still do that...  have the parent pop up the
child window, as usual, the form in the child submits as any other form
would (i assume with a php script as the action=), and the script that acts
on that form could include a very basic html document with a bit of
javascript that is an onload handler for the body tag...

[html]
[head]
[script type="text/javascript"]
function allDone()
{    parent.location = "newlocation/fortheparent.php";
      self.close();
}
[/script]
[/head]
[body onload="allDone()"]
&nbsp;
[/body]
[/html]

either method will work well, but the second route doesn't require the
redudant hidden fields and whatnot.
hope this helps!

I'll have to try and find some of my source for this.  Don't get me wrong, I
don't submit the one window to the other.  The submit button on the popup
executes a java script which does:

opener.someform.somehiddenfield.value = mypopup.someform.sometextfield.value

for each field.  Then opener.someform.submit();

Just call this from the pop up window, to reload/refresh your parent window
with a new url
      window.opener.location= 'http://your_refresh_url'

another function that is usefull is
      parent.reload();

this will reload the parent window

Two things about this:

1) You often won't want to hardcode the name of the form or the field
- you can pass these values to the popup window (via PHP) to make your
life easier. I randomly generate the name of every form (again, using
PHP) so I can do this using multiple forms and fields and every popup
knows which form and field it goes with.
 
2) As a point of interest, you can absolutely put the results of a
form in another window.

You can do this by setting the target attribute of the form, either
directly in the form tag or with javascript - it's a property of the
form object.

document.someform.target = 'formtargetwindow';

or some such. When you submit the form, the results will appear in
formtargetwindow.

Now that we've heard all (1) of the realy cheap places to host your AMP
site (2), does anyone have recommendations for ISPs that are good for
fully or partially managed servers?  co-location?  I work for a small dev
shop, and we are constantly shuttling between all of these little
companies to fine a good deal.  

I've been trying to persuade the group to invest in a managed or a colo
server recently.  One of our clients has a managed server with AT&T.  The
service is impeccable, but the price tag is close to $5k/month which is a
little high.  I would appreciate all of your responses.  I've done some
research myself, but all of these companies say they do the same thing
with a varying array of pricing structures.

So tell me your experiences with these guys. 


Thanks in advance,

Jim Bishop

Hans,

I'm currently using this script myself for that purpose:

>From a link:
  <a href="javascript:closeNewURL(this,'new.html')">Go</a>
>From a button:
  <input type="button" onclick="closeNewURL(this,'new.html')">


// Close the popup and go to a new URL in the parent.
function closeNewURL (winPop, strURL) {
	winPop.opener.location.href = strURL;
	winPop.close();
}



I've also got a library of functions for this same project available here:

this is ABSOLUTELY *NOT* a cross-browser solution...
only things that work in all browsers without any issues
are either copying values to a set a hidden fields in the parent
and having the child submit that form in the parent and then close
itself, OR to have the child redirect the parent then close itself
using an onload handler as part of the script that deals with the
submitted form...  i *wish* setting the form target (either
dynamically with javascript or statically using the target=
attribute of form) but it isn't support unequivocally,
and it's not likely that it ever will be.

Hans,

Sorry, this one may be more useful.  You can set the flag by putting 
"submit=true" in the form action if you are POSTing, or in a hidden form 
field if you are GETting:

Call:
<body onload="submitClose(this);">


// Check the URL for the submit flag, close the window, and reload the 
parent window.
function submitClose (winPop) {
	var strPath = location.href;
	if (strPath.search("submit") > -1) {
		closeReload(winPop);
	}
}

Interesting. It's part of the HTML 4.01 spec.

http://www.htmlref.com/reference/AppA/form.htm
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/frames.html#h-16.3

What browsers don't support this?

it's common knowledge that browsers often don't conform to specs :)

i recall having difficulty with form target'ing in netscape 3 and 4...
dunno if this is fixed with the advent of the most recent mozilla.

not sure about others...  opera, aol browser, etc.

Too true, but I was under the impression that all of the modern
browsers had come up to speed on HTML 4.01. Unless demanded by a
client, I've pretty much given up on trying to get any real
functionality out of older browsers and will generally settle for
"degrade gracefully". At least on the delivery side. On the editing
side, you can usually dictate browser platform.

Don't know. I don't think it should really be a surprise that old
browsers don't have the same capabilities as newer ones... :)

> not sure about others...  opera, aol browser, etc.

Opera 6 claims to, although I haven't tested it:

Wow, thanks for the all the responses.

After picking bits from each post, I've finally done something like:

-- the PHP script that handles the form POST prints this to the popup:

<script language="JavaScript">
   if( opener ) {
      opener.location.assign('<?=$next?>');
      opener.location.reload(true);
      window.close();
   } else {
      window.location.assign('<?=$next?>');
   }
</script>

where $next is where I want the main browser window to go.  I had
considered passing the next URL in through the JavaScript call to
create the popup (and this does seem to give the most flexibility), but
really wanted to maintain my redirects from the server (I have a DB of
"if posted from there, you now go here" that changes frequently).  This
isn't as direct as sending a HTTP header, but heck, it seems to work
(and still covers non-popups).

Ideally, I would have wished there was a way to read the HTTP headers
sent from PHP into JavaScript/JScript and then act on them.  Supposedly
there is
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/constants/response_headers.asp)
but as with so much client-side, I could never get them to do anything.
:)

Thanks again,

H

I have one further enhancement to suggest, drawn from a function I use
elsewhere. In the latter case, if the headers have not yet been sent,
you'll want to use PHP to generate a redirect header for you instead
of loading the page and redirecting with javascript. This is basically
what I'm thinking, although I have yet to test it to see if it works
consistently:

--------------------

function REDIRECT ($url) 
{
  if (substr($url, 0, 7) != 'http://') {
    if (substr($url, 0, 1) == '/') {
      $url = 'http://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].$url;
    } else {
      $url = 'http://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'/'.$url;
    }
  }
  if (!headers_sent()) {
    header('Location: '.$url);
  } else {
    print '<script>';
    print "location.href='".$url."';";
    print '</script>';
  }
}

I got most of the functionality of my session-based jumpback stack
working today. Don't know if that'll help you at all.

Originally I had been using this technique, and of course it works
great.  However, when the headers are sent back to the popup (which is
where the form submit happens) I can't find a way to detect that in
JavaScript and use the new URL to refresh the main window.  As far as I
could tell, all the obvious stuff doesn't work, ie: when executing from
the popup, document.location.href always refers to the originally
requested URL.

Sure, I'd be interested in seeing it.

It's frustrating, after reading the above link, that there's no way to
see the "Location" header that gets sent to a window.  If you run into
anything else I'd be curious.

I use no-ip.com and very happy with it.  They also let you use your own domain

I use no-ip.com and very happy with it. With redirect service you can route to 
any port you are listening on. They also let you use your own domain 
name for $24 a year.

Can anybody recommend a good Inventory Management software ? Specifically for servers/computers and related spare parts. 

I've been searching freshmeat and the web and the best I can find is IRM  ( http://irm.schoenefeld.org/ ).  It doesn't seem to do parts. Only configured systems.

Anybody know anything better?

Thanks.

Hello Oktay,

Have you heard of the new open source ERP company, Openmfg ? Their solution may be a little too elaborate, though, for just a simple inventory system.

I'd be interested in something like this too. Would really help with a 
project I've been thinking of. There are a couple of other projects that 
 came up on Freshmeat when I searched. What did you think of these?

phpInv is a small yet highly configurable inventory script written in 
PHP with a MySQL backend. It features unlimited categories, unlimited 
depth of sub-categories, customizable columns per category, an 
administration control panel, access permissions (user and group), easy 
configuration, a template system, and searching.
http://freshmeat.net/projects/phpinv/?topic_id=66%2C92%2C129%2C253

PgWebInventory is a complete home inventory database and interface. The 
declarations for the tables are included along with the PHP interface 
scripts. Once installed, the database can be accessed and updated via 
any Web browser.

Try NOLA from Noguska

It is good for Bechtel and should be good enough for many.  It has got a PDF
generation so that your system is not tied to any printer, important thing
in outdoor and warehouse situation.

Look around for whether the package has been around long enough.. Good way
to know if it has been used.
Good luck.

Yes. I've come accross these too.
'phpInv is small [...] inventory script'. Well. it's too small for our purposes. 

the other one.. PgWebInventory " is a simple way to inventory your books, movies, and music at home. ", and no it doesn't look like it would work if customized it.

In short.. everything that is out there for free seem to be too simplistice. The best of the lot is IRM.

I will still keep looking at the software, but I wanted to let you know that their license is NOT open source. They might call it that but it does not comply with the open source definition. It's definetely *NOT* free software either.

True. I've been pairing this with another redirector page that tests
if you're in a popup, and then doesn't do this for popups.

Any idea if there's an OS tool to put out slides like that, or is

Hello Adam,

While I was writing a JavaScript based slide show tool, I searched on 
sourceforge.net and came up with many different php powered slide show 
tools.

I wrote a small, simple  JavaScript slideshow script which works 
differently from (complex) php / database driven ones: First place the 
index.html for the slideshow page in your slideshow directory: e.g.: 
www.yourname.com/slides/index.html; then just put pictures named image0, 
image1, image2 and so in an "images" subdirectory, e.g. : 
 www.yourname.com/slides/images . Then change the number of total slides 
in the script (a variable), edit a series of paragraph tags in the 
index.html, and you're ready to go.

 I have been thinking about releasing this script under the GPL license 
for some time now - because it might be of use to other people.

Regards,

- Jay

We also might be able to improve your code. Then you'll benefit :)  

To Adam:  OpenOffice has an HTML export feature in their Powerpoint
replacement, though I haven't played with it much.
