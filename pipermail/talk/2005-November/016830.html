This language sounds very instigative to me, and I'm not sure if this is an appropriate post for this particular forum.

However, having had to wade through numerous 'NetObjects', 'Dreamweaver', 'Visual Studio' and other 'assisted' created pages, I'd say that having the most atomic knowledge of your code is best, from a technical perspective. Now if you're a project lead or Exec. I could see the draw of such products, being as it will allow you to shave costs on not having to hire more technically savvy coders. IMHO, educating them to use Eclipse with the hundreds if not thousands of different plugins would be a much wiser choice.

There is something to be said of the increase of deployment speed, and the comparative decrease of stage-time. Visual Studio does seem to lend to developing applications quicker. But then again so does Ruby. Or the proper usage of various frameworks, such as QCodo or Mojavi. I guess in an enterprise facility it all depends upon what you want to standardize on.

For PHP, I tried the ZEND app, which was neat, but still some things to be desired. I use Eclipse alot, however, I always find myself back in old Homesite+ inevitably... I guess some of us are just made to swim through code.

  Hey, guys, nice to hear your responses.  However, there's always 2 sides to an argument, and I do not agree with you.  Somehow men think that only hard work is how things get done.  With women, they know it's finesse that works.  And I believe Visual Studio has finesse and class (sorry for the pun).

    This is exactly what was going through my head when reading that post.

    So, are you saying that you like MS products better because they relieve 
    the need for you to perform as a responsible individual and write your 
    code portable and generic so that it can be used in many different projects?

    I don't think I am interested in any platform which pets you and tries 
    to define good coding as not putting forth the initial effort yourself.

    &gt;&gt; I used to program in VB and C++ and loved the graphical programming

    &gt;&gt; objects that I knew in VB. I tried PHP with Dreamweaver, but the code 
    &gt;&gt; Dreamweaver created was not &quot;clean&quot; code that could be easily tweaked.

    &gt; Then you arent really a programmer, you are an Excel user..
    &gt; You know, there is a &quot;write .class once, copy paste into new apps many 
    &gt; times&quot; paradigm..
