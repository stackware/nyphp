The problem is that you cannot accurately identify different 8 bit 
encodings from each other. Latin-1 (iso-8859-1) and Latin-9 
(iso-8859-15) text may contain identical byte sequences and still 
different content so you have no way to know which one user intended 
to use.

Some 8 bit encodings have different *probabilities* for different 
byte sequences and you could make an educated guess which encoding 
the user agent really used. That would still be just a guess.

The way I do it is that I send the html with UTF-8 encoding (I also 
have &lt;form accept-charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ...&gt; in case some user agent 
supports that, most user agents just use the same encoding the page 
with the form used) and I check that the user input is valid UTF-8 
byte sequence. If the user input isn't a valid UTF-8 sequence then I 
just take it as a fact that the real encoding is iso-8859-1 and I 
blindly convert from iso-8859-1 to UTF-8 -- I've yet to see an user 
agent which does support different encodings AND doesn't support 
UTF-8 AND defaults to any other charset but iso-8859-1.

So far, this has worked perfectly. Or should I say, almost 
correctly... I'm pretty sure that some windows user agents send 
incorrect unicode characters that are technically correctly encoded 
as UTF-8. I believe that those invalid characters are meant to 
represent code points from windows-1252 character set and user agent 
doesn't correctly translate from windows-1252 to UTF-8. Expect to 
see such input if user, for example, copies text containing &quot;smart 
quotes&quot; from MS Word to text area.

&gt;<i> Naturally mangled input is not what I want, so I guess it's okay that 
</I>&gt;<i> mysql didn't destroy the data. :o) What I really want is that if 
</I>&gt;<i> $_POST['usertext'] == &#22823;&#38442;&#24066;&#28010;&#36895;&#21306;&#12398;&#12510;&#12531;&#12471;&#12519;&#12531; [wow, how does that look 
</I>&gt;<i> in your mail reader?] then the app will know it and tell the user 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;please enter only characters in the Latin-1 set&quot;.
</I>
Those japanese characters work just fine because your mail used 
UTF-8 encoding.
