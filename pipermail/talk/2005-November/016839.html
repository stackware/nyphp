<PRE>I just finished taking a class on ASP.NET and I was impress.
I was an ASP programmer back in 2000 using Visual Studio.
I like writing code using 'vi' and I am all for PHP programming
but ASP.NET  is impressive.  I am playing a bit with a Creator and JSF.
Sun's Creator is trying to do similar drag and drop that ASP.NET offers.
Althought my current job is as a C/Unix programmer I missed the PHP/WEB world.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey, guys, nice to hear your responses.  However, there's always 2 sides to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an argument, and I do not agree with you.  Somehow men think that only hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work is how things get done.  With women, they know it's finesse that works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  And I believe Visual Studio has finesse and class (sorry for the pun).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a long-term resident of Seattle in the last decade, I remember
</I>&gt;<i> delivering several projects on the initial platform (then called
</I>&gt;<i> Visual InterDev 1.0 IIRC). My experiences on that platform were, that
</I>&gt;<i> as long as you stuck to commonly-needed functionality and standard
</I>&gt;<i> widgets, you were good to go. The second you deviate from the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the herd, unfortunately, meant you would have to forego the comfy
</I>&gt;<i> controlled confines of the graphical environment and dig manually
</I>&gt;<i> through thousands and thousands of poorly formatted, generated code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, it was excellent if you were developing the same exact appls
</I>&gt;<i> that everyone else was needing to develop. If you needed something
</I>&gt;<i> unique or uncommon you were at a great disadvantage, as the
</I>&gt;<i> development environment was not friendly to the do-it-yourself
</I>&gt;<i> approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My wife is the smartest person that I know, and she once explained the
</I>&gt;<i> difference of the environments (and their impact on me personally)
</I>&gt;<i> most succinctly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You know, back when you were on Microsoft stuff you spent the entire
</I>&gt;<i> day swearing at your computer. Now that you are back to open source
</I>&gt;<i> you spend the entire day swearing at yourself.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have never heard a more profound observation of my work habits than
</I>&gt;<i> that one sentence, and it couldn't have been more correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that in mind I suppose it is irrelevant what your gender is, but
</I>&gt;<i> more important who/what you want to be the cause of your
</I>&gt;<i> limitations/frustration at the end of the day. And I'd rather be mad
</I>&gt;<i> at myself for not figuring something out the first time, than be
</I>&gt;<i> trapped in an environment that I cannot fix.
