<PRE>Since we're in the market for a SAN at NYBG I was all set to attend this fine sounding event.

Something's come up and I cannot attend.

Apparently there are about still about 10 spaces.  If you are in a decision-making type role at your job and you're in the market for storage solutions this will interest you... Hopefully you can get away for a few hours and check it out.

cheers, J.

To help you learn more about protecting and optimizing your storage environment, FalconStor Software &#151; the industry leader in BCDR and VTL&#151; cordially invites you to an exclusive event on Thursday, November 17 at the hip W Hotel in Union Square, New York. There was a time when data protection just meant backups. They didn't work all that well, but everybody accepted that as the status quo. Now times have changed, with exponentially damaging effects for companies whose backups fail. The good news is that the storage industry is addressing the issues. A powerful panel of experts &#150; including W. Curtis Preston, VP of Data Protection at GlassHouse Technologies; Ken Male, founder and CEO of The Info Pro; Wayne Lam, co-founder of FalconStor, and John Lallier, VP of Technology at FalconStor &#150; explain the problems plaguing today's data centers, and follows with the facts about solutions available for all of your most challenging data protection issues.

First-person enduser success stories will be presented by executives from Hartz Mountain, the largest privately held real-estate firm in the US, and Skadden Arps LLP, one of the country&#146;s top corporate law firms.

Gourmet lunch and dessert from Todd English's renowned Olive's restaurant will be served.

Cocktails to follow seminar.

Bonus
You will receive a FREE evaluation of your storage environment, and qualify to win the cool new portable Archos&#174; DVR everyone wants. Plus, you will be eligible to receive a special discount on FalconStor products reserved exclusively for attendees of this event.
