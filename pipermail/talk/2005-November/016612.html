<PRE>The developer section is somewhat buried. See this:
<A HREF="http://developer.authorize.net/">http://developer.authorize.net/</A>
 

authorize.net has a nice developer section and PHP development code. You
can get a test account to debug the transaction flow:
<A HREF="https://test.authorize.net/">https://test.authorize.net/</A>  Many resellers work with them. Rates seem
to be pretty good.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] pharma merchant processor



I would prefer to not use paypal and offer my client less charge per
transaction. I already have the software setup, I just need to tell it
where to point to.  Using paypal would mean restructuring my whole
admin. 

Any other suggestions?

I know there have been talks about online merchant processors, but can
anyone

recommend one that will handle pharmaceutical related products?  My
client says

he will just be selling home health care products and not prescriptions,
but

seems to keep getting his applications denied.



I need one that uses Auth.net, or will sync up to it. (I've only done
one other

online store before)



He even had someone deny him on the basis that there is a graphic in the
design



 



    

Someone on the list mentioned Paypal Website Pro earlier. If you don't 

HAVE to use auth.net, Paypal is currently letting anyone apply and there


is no monthly fee until 2/1/06. The new paypal feature doesn't require 

the end user to have a paypal account or even know that paypal is in the


background doing the processing. It's pretty much like Verisign payflow 

pro (which, BTW, Ebay acquired recently). They also have a virtual 

terminal so you can enter transactions in by hand. The downside is that 

paypal charges 2.9%+30cents/transaction where as many other auth.net 

merchants accounts charge roughly 2.1%+25c/transaction. Oscommerce and 

miva both support the new paypal pro api. I was thinking of writing a 

generic interface for use with Zencart and other shopping carts over the


next few days.
