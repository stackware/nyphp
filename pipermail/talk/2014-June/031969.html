Likewise I could claim that it is incorrect to conclude that just because you 
have an FB account everyone else has or should have one, too. Some sites 
insist on using only FB accounts or publish info only on their FB page that 
requires an FB account to view.
Yes, that is their prerogative, but a pretty dumb move if the point is to get 
people to use your services. And given the security track record of FB I am 
not so sure if I'd call that securing anything.

Landlines and dialup are still the only means of connectivity for many, 
especially in rural areas. Of course, if that is not part of the target 
audience then feel free to ignore it...and load up the pages with images and 
video.
The numbers only slowly go down in favor of satellite or cell service.

</I>Neither are you...my point is that by picking very specific 3rd party services 
to be used you exclude a good number of folks. If that matters is a case by 
case decision.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> accounts most likely only need complex passwords[based on potential damage

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, for these things, you almost certainly want a second layer of

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the relatively small cost.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree, but in best US fashion the industry miserably fails at agreeing on

</I>Agreed, the gummibear trick showed that nicely. Which brings me back to the 
point that if something is so hot that it needs utmost security then the 
public web might be not the place that should be accessible through.
