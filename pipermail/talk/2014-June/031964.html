</I>
Sorry, I respectfully disagree. Of the several I mentioned, you claimed 
to only have one. You can offer the 'create your own account', but users 
should be encouraged to use some other account and use something like 
OAuth to provide user authentication.

The notion of &quot;I don't have FB, therefore nobody should force FB auth&quot; 
is equivalent to saying &quot;we must absolutely positively backwards support 
IE6&quot;. This is 2014, sorry, if you don't want any social media accounts, 
that's your prerogative, but the vast majority of everyone else does.

&gt;<i> And offer more options for the second factor. For example, I do not 
</I>&gt;<i> have a smartphone (yes, saves a lot of money every month). So unless 
</I>&gt;<i> you can figure out how to send an SMS to my landline forget it. In 
</I>&gt;<i> 2014 it should be possible to dial my phone and use voice recognition 
</I>&gt;<i> to confirm a pass phrase.
</I>In fact, Sprint will do text-to-voice if it detects a voiceline (or at 
least it used to). But once again, we shouldn't aim towards supporting 
IE6 forever. We're also not optimizing the user experience for those 
using lynx...
Remember that you are not the world.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> accounts most likely only need complex passwords[based on potential 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> damage
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of a compromised account...if a site manager can give out refunds and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> credits for an e-commerce site, obviously you want to add extra 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> security!]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, for these things, you almost certainly want a second layer of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authentication atop the ones above. For these, little crypto keyfobs are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great. If the potential financial loss is large, the client should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not balk at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the relatively small cost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, but in best US fashion the industry miserably fails at 
</I>&gt;<i> agreeing on a standard here. Then again, with any of these fobs you 
</I>&gt;<i> are authenticating the fob, not the person holding the fob. For that 
</I>&gt;<i> you'd need biometrics which is yet another can of worms.
</I>Indeed: you are assuming that the user has both something-you-know and 
something-you-have. Biometrics isn't foolproof either, vis 
<A HREF="http://bbc.in/1oQshE4">http://bbc.in/1oQshE4</A> (link is SFW).

&gt;&gt;<i> More and more people just use &quot;I forgot my password&quot;, and deal with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way. Either you've exchanged the password for a security question, or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access to a user's email.
</I>&gt;<i> That's because passwords suck! As do password managers which end up 
</I>&gt;<i> being the single point of failure (I do use them anyway). As mentioned 
</I>&gt;<i> above, it is sad that after over 50 years of client/server computing 
</I>&gt;<i> there is nothing better than and as accepted as user names and passwords.
</I>User authentication is hard. Let's go shopping!
