We might add that interfaces can be useful for type-hinting in your method
signature, possibly saving you some extra defensive-coding and checking what
was passed in.


public function doSomething(Fooable $fooable) {

        // you can count on $fooable implementing Fooable
       //  or you won't get this far w/o a fatal

Great idea.

I've been thinking  (following our long thread about Verizon FIOS,
technology etc.) that we could use a OffTopic-Sig for the same reason, i.e.,
there's a lot of stuff that isn't On Topic that one enjoys discussing with
these list-people.

Message-ID: <865a7acf0906021311l3b560e67w2936eda5fa899e3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm interested in hearing what kind of classes, packages, solutions
the professionals on this list use to protect their sites against spam
in relation to comments.
For example, users commenting on other user's pages like Facebook or
any social networking site.

I am not using WordPress, Drupal, or other CMS, blog software,
frameworks, so plugins for those won't work, but maybe I can learn
something from them.

Basically, I'm interested in hearing opinions on different options to
block comment spam.

Currently, I'm only using a visual CAPTCHA, but I'm afraid that that
is easily defeatable.

I've also heard of using hidden form fields, and checking if they're
filled in or not on the backend when the form is processed.

Any other ideas?

Thanks,
Konstantin

Zend Framework has an akismet service component that you might find
useful:

Akismet helps my wordpress blog stay pretty much 100% free of comment
spam, though I do get occasional spam user sign-ups...

Comment spam is pretty similar to email spam -- there are a bunch of
tricks you can use to slow down dumb scripts, but then the scripts get
smarter and you're back to square one. Hidden form fields, randomized
form field names, and even captchas can all be defeated once the
spambots get smart enough.

Akismet takes a different approach -- it basically acts as a global
spam filter, though as the risk of false positives.
http://akismet.com/

You could do the same thing by running all of your comments through a
GMail inbox. The idea is to use the powerful tools that have already
been developed for email spam, and also to make it "someone else's
problem" so that you don't have to spend any more time on it.

Konstantin,

You might consider looking at http://akismet.com/.  This is the data/API
provider that the WordPress plugin uses.  You can get a key and then access
their API using your application.  You will have the opportunity to check
your comments against a HUGE database of comments from WordPress blogs and
other sites all over the world. Plus, if you choose to, you can contribute
to the database by classifying the comments as spam or not as you approve
them.

I believe there are other technologies that offer comparable services,
however I am not as familiar with them.

Warmest regards,
Hans Kaspersetz

Cyber X Designs, http://www.cyberxdesigns.com, builds promotional websites,
ecommerce websites, and portals with open source technologies for companies
world wide.

you can also create a "hidden" input  not type="hidden" use CSS to hide it, that never gets filled out by people visiting the site...but spam bots tend to fill out all visible inputs :)

    No matter what technological measures you use,  you'll need a user 
interface to make hand edits.  For instance,  my site at

http://spoonriveranthology.net/

    uses Disqus for comments because I didn't have time to develop a 
good commenting system for that site.  Disqus is a service that runs on 
a central server that transcludes comments into your site with 
Javascript:  it gives you a pretty decent threaded commenting system 
with an admin UI,  spam defense and other good features.  There's a 
similar service from IntenseDebate,  which is also pretty good...  I 
just picked Disqus because I had to pick something.

    When I first made that site,  I had a comment system that was packed 
as a symfony plug-in.  I had a battle with a spammer:  I found it easier 
to delete his crap with the SQL monitor than with the UI that came with 
the comment system.  I managed to stop him by filtering on certain words 
and blocking any attempt to post links,  but it wasn't a good answer.

    Recently I switched to Disqus comments.  This has increased the 
average # of pages per visit on the site from 8 to 10.  It took about an 
hour to Disqus.

    Today,  the main problem is that that site appeals to a teen 
audience.  Some of the comments are brilliant,  but some are absurdly 
stupid and I delete them to keep the discussion readable.

    I was able to get Disqus integrated with my site in about an hour.  
Disqus has a good API for getting your comments in and out, so it's not 
a roach motel like the Facebook or Google Friend Connect Comments.  I 
could import my old comments into Disqus,  but I haven't gotten around 
to it.

You should also make sure your comment system is using rel="nofollow",
and doesn't have any XSS issues.

If you aren't using rel="nofollow", and the site has page rank, then
it will be worth the spammer's time to manually defeat your form.

Agreed, using Disqus is easy. I use it for my blog, which I don't
really expect comments on.

I would not use it long term if comments were really important to me,
for three reasons:

1) Requires javascript, which pisses off smart people
2) Introduces visual clutter
3) Your comments are now split from your content

Reason three is probably the most important, long term. If Disqus goes
away, or messes something up all of your comments are gone. If you
change the URI of the page, all that page's comments are gone. Also,
Google doesn't index your comments with your site.

It's a great service, but balance that against the potential
consequences before you use it.

If only that was true.

I've had rel="nofollow" in my comments froms since 2003 and I still
get dumb spammers who either don't know or don't care.

Wow, I am impressed.  Google announced nofollow in 2005, and you
already had it implemented for two years. :)

Fair cop. But that's still four years worth of spam with rel="nofollow".

A quick aside to the nature of IntenseDebate

They give you access in a database to all your comments - during the beta I had it setup to autobackup the comments once approved to my blog.

Thanks guys for the info and links.  I will check out akismet and Disqus.

mollom.com looks interesting because they also offer a dedicated
high-availability solution whereby you can host their service on your
own servers, especially if you've got the traffic.  Thanks for that
link!

Basically, I'm looking into Akismet and Mollom at this point.  Very
interested in the dedicated, high-availability, and high performance
solutions for comment spam.

For those of you that want to join my browsercam.com group, I have space
available.  There's 2 of us, so I have 10 slots open.

 

It's roughly $40/mo for a regular membership.  It's like $60 bucks for a one
time temporary use.

 

To join my group it's like $50/year.  I'll look up the specifics later.
Like $50 give or take a buck or two.

 

What can you do with browsercam? View screen shots of your developed
websites in browsers you don't have installed on your computer.

 

I don't need it right now.  But, even if you only need it once a year, you
already have a membership, so you don't have to sign up and you save $10
bucks, so when you're busy working it will save you time in getting on with
the development.  How many times have you thought, "I wonder what it looks
like in IE6?"  So, join a group now.

 

Email me directly if you're interested.

I don't want to rain on your parade, but isn't that something a VM and the IE 
package from Tredosoft can do? Does browsercam do something that the regular 
IE instances can't do? When I test browser based apps at work I have one 
Windows VM and a Linux VM with all the popular and not so popular browsers 
including IE from version 3.0 up. That covers all rendering engines and about 
all OS (after all Mac OS X is just a window manager on top of BSD, but I also 
got a Mac for testing). I recently transferred those VMs from Workstation to 
Server 2.0 so that I can run it one a different box. And with the free TechNet 
accounts that Microsoft gives out I could even run the IEs natively on yet 
another set of VMs.

I've never seen an Abobe product for free.  I can't afford abobe, wish I
could, but when development's finished, I'd guess it will be outside of my
budget.

Don't work you aren't raining on my parade.  It's more like a trail of tears
for me.  (If you don't know what a trail of tears is then you can Yahoo!
It.)

I've had problems with running virtual machines on my computer.  The last
time I tried it failed on me and I didn't have more time to look into it.

Using this website saves me from having a ton of more software loaded on my
one overloaded ancient pc.

I don't need it extensively so it's a good solution for me.  If I was doing
more heavy css testing I might have to consider something else, but it fits
my needs of periodic testing.  If you have a group subscription then the
price is nominal.

Plus, I don't test one at a time.  I select many browsers at once and in
renders them all about 15 minutes later, while I'm doing something else.

If there's a specific problem, then I can put my attention to it.

yeah you just missed it. :(

However, word is, it's not going to be very expensive, and it will have 
plugins across the adobe suite.

Adobe Actionscript(Flash), Flex/MXML and AIR are free, you can find the 
compilers on adobelabs.

This has to be easy but I'm so pre-occupied with other stuff that I

I have an array, let's say 12 elements. I want to remove element 7. I 
could array_slice out the first 6 and also the last 5 and then combine 
those resulting arrays but that seems like a very tedious way to do it. 
There has to be an easier way????????

Nope, because that'll unset the eighth element!

You want unset($array[6]) :P

And then if you want to re-key the array: array_slice($array)

I think you want array_splice, rather than array_slice

array_splice($arr,6,1);

unset() will work, but won't reset the numerical index, which is the only
thing array_slice is being used for; if he needs the index in the same
order, unset() is a better option as it's faster, but if he needs a
re-index, we'd have to benchmark :]

This is just my exceptionally small irreverent dos centavos on this
topic. 

For about two years now, it seems one has been pretty much able to
develop almost anything desired using virtually any CSS and any
JavaScript (and using big heavy image files to boot) in 1000+ pixel wide
designs and its all good. 

And at this time, if one were to find that one needs to spend too much
hard time reviewing browser compatibility issues, then it is almost
axiomatic that the code itself is not sufficiently or democratically
"cross browser and platform independent" enough in the first place.
Essentially: a) don't use any IE specific code; b) don't use any code
that does not run in IE; and c) especially important, don't use any code
that don?t run in IE Mac. Just not ever. Do something else. Use some
Flash gadget. If you don?t do a, b or c; all the code vets itself and
will be browser independent and automagically run on old browsers too
boot going way back. 

Lastly, try to use <doctype> XHTML "Transitional" to be easy on yourself
and all your friends. You'd be surprised how many "browser"
compatibility issues are actually and simply <doctype> issues. "Strict"
breaks a lot of CSS and indirectly the JavaScript code.  And that
heartache is simply not necessary. 

Then browser compatibility issues seem to just vanish.  

Warmest regards, 
?

Don't work you aren't raining on my parade.  It's more like a trail of
tears
for me.  (If you don't know what a trail of tears is then you can Yahoo!
It.)

I've had problems with running virtual machines on my computer.  The
last
time I tried it failed on me and I didn't have more time to look into
it.

Using this website saves me from having a ton of more software loaded on
my
one overloaded ancient pc.

I don't need it extensively so it's a good solution for me.  If I was
doing
more heavy css testing I might have to consider something else, but it
fits
my needs of periodic testing.  If you have a group subscription then the
price is nominal.

Plus, I don't test one at a time.  I select many browsers at once and in
renders them all about 15 minutes later, while I'm doing something else.

If there's a specific problem, then I can put my attention to it.

There's a few ways to skin this cat but Eddie is right. Based one this
email's title I think using unset() should suffice.

Hi Michele

I really like what you are doing. Some tools are just to expensive for a 
casual programmer/designer.
But if anyone is looking for a free tool take a look at: 
http://browsershots.org/ it has some ads on the page but it does the job 
done as well.

So you suggest don't use:
#some_div {
  width: 100px;
  padding: 2px;
  margin: 1px;
}

I don't see anything IE/Firefox/Opera/Chrome specific but check the results
and some resource:
http://www.ozzu.com/website-design-forum/firefox-interpret-css-padding-differently-t32917.html

Cross browser compatibility has been a problem since they came up with 
netscape and IE and will never end.

It'll end when Google succeeds in taking over the internet and we all use

I do not write ie or ff specific css.  As a matter of fact all of my
css/html works on any browser once debugged.

If you are writing specific browser code then your code is wrong.  I could
write a doc on tips for cross-browser css/html compatibility.  Like using
top and left instead of padding or margin.

Javascript is an exception.  There is necessity for browser specific, but
that can be streamlined somewhat.

But, to find all of your css/html bugs you have to test in all the browers.
I've found Opera to be the best at finding bugs.  But, every now and then
something in my html/css crops up in IE6.

It took me 3 months to figure out the right ways to code css/html without
specifying browser and cut that slop out.

Some doctypes seem to restrict javascript.  I've found that to be a problem
when the javascript in necessary.

I need my javascript and html/css to all work.  I like my php to work too.
;)

Browsershots restricts daily usage.  I also paid for extended use of like
$15.  That money was out the window.  I got nothing.

I tried it.  Then I joined browsercam.

I guarantee all of my css/html works on any browser when I'm finished
without browser specific code.

Uh, Oh.

Besides, we are talking $50/year, even that is affordable to the casual
designer/programmer.

That's why you join a group and not by yourself.

Now, me I don't guarantee anything (especially not in writing), but I do
use words such as code is "targeted for assured compatibility with" blah
blah.

As far as I can tell, speaking with one handy broad paint stroke, as
long as the JavaScript code in question is always addressing everything
in the DOM via the general and proper "getElementById()" method
including XML=like child elements (and nothing in any older style), then
this JavaScript code is current, correct and sufficiently "cross
browser, platform independent" to work in all relevant and
widely-distributed browsers. If this type of modern democratic
ECMAScript breaks in any old browser, then it is very likely that that
browser is TOO old and is likely a security hazard to code down to in
this day and age. And so I wouldn't bother to do that and I would tell
the client so. And that gets the "old browser compatibility" albatross
off the table too. Yeah, nice.

And so once again, I find that Opera, IE, Safari and FF can all play
ball just by coding to clean modern standards.

I don't use layouts that stretch to 100% page width. That is a CSS
control nightmare. I make one master relatively positioned outer div
container of a fixed width of 900 - 1100 px and then every other div is
an absolutely positioned child div inside the master div.

What does this mean:
"But you can run browsershots yourself.

Great Post Artur, my CentOS box will be running this in the next ten
minutes!"

Browsershots would not let me run more more than say every 1/2 an hour.  How
can you debug a website like that.  What do you tell your client?  I'm
billing you for all of the half hours while I wait for browershots to run
again because I don't want to pay a $50 annual fee for a non restrictive
tool?

Browsershots will not let your run more than like every half an hour or so.
I don't remember exactly, but I followed someone's suggestion tried
browsershots and I was sorry.

Join my group or not.  I really don't care.  I'm paying for a subscription
either way.

One closing thought:

I think in the analysis of the importance of "browser compatibility"
issue(s), it would be better that we get unfocused from the "older"
browser compatibility issue and bury that and get freshly focused more
on whether our websites are compatible with iPhones and Smartphones and
other tiny devices instead.

Now, me I don't guarantee anything (especially not in writing), but I do use
words such as code is "targeted for assured compatibility with" blah blah.

As far as I can tell, speaking with one handy broad paint stroke, as long as
the JavaScript code in question is always addressing everything in the DOM
via the general and proper "getElementById()" method including XML=like
child elements (and nothing in any older style), then this JavaScript code
is current, correct and sufficiently "cross browser, platform independent"
to work in all relevant and widely-distributed browsers. If this type of
modern democratic ECMAScript breaks in any old browser, then it is very
likely that that browser is TOO old and is likely a security hazard to code
down to in this day and age. And so I wouldn't bother to do that and I would
tell the client so. And that gets the "old browser compatibility" albatross
off the table too. Yeah, nice.

And so once again, I find that Opera, IE, Safari and FF can all play ball
just by coding to clean modern standards.

I don't use layouts that stretch to 100% page width. That is a CSS control
nightmare. I make one master relatively positioned outer div container of a
fixed width of 900 - 1100 px and then every other div is an absolutely
positioned child div inside the master div.

You know, I'm not even on the frontend list. I missed that.

CSS/PHP MENU

This URL: http://www.giba.us

...is a simple but elegant PHP website I designed and built that has an
example of a very simple CSS one-level menu that also uses PHP to grab
the page name out of the URL request and changes the CSS class on that
matching menu item from "regular" to "hot". The web pages are named
literally: webcams.php or tolls.php to match the CSS menu titles and CSS
style names too.


JQUERY

This URL: http://www.capehazeinsider.com

...is also a bigger busier PHP website that I designed and built and
this site uses jquery on literally every page for: image effects,
show/hide/glide divs, manage external links, create popup overlays, page
scrolling, tabbed content...

I highly recommend the jquery code products which are just awesome and
have super high degree of "cross browser" compatibility. 

I even hauled out the jquery big guns to create one single show/hide div
effect in the Tolls section of the above noted GIBA website. 

I have two websites in development now that will use jquery for quite
nice image effects and content scrolling. 

___________________________

I don?t believe that I am using any browser specific code just generic
things like: border-left, padding-bottom, margin, width and z-index. But
you know I do use some more rare CSS like: line-height, letter-spacing
and white-space; and well they work quite accurately in so many browsers
that I use them all the time. 

There are so many high quality CSS multi-level menus already online that
are made from nothing but nested ordered lists and styled with some
tasty but very generic CSS. You can start at www.alistapart.com

Heya,

So, I have this script that does the following:

1.  Requests jpeg from origin CDN via cURL
2.  If file doesnt exist... log error, continue.
3.  Write jpeg to temp file
4.  Resize original image (GD lib) to temp file. FTP to directory on  
new CDN.  Create directory structure if not present.  Repeat seven  
times per image.

Not sure how many, but we're talking about 10k; maybe 15k images.

The script works, but problem we're running into is the memory limit.   
We got about 31% through the images, and hit:

PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 524288000 bytes exhausted  
(tried to allocate 41760 bytes) in /web/lib/php/populate_images.php on  
line 135

Maybe it's me, but if we have to allot more than 500 MB of memory,  
something is wrong.

Any ideas?  Maybe sleep the script after each image?

We're running the script in shell.

GD needs to operate on raw data so even if the jpegs are smaller than  
your 500mb limit, when it expands it, it will go over.

A couple ideas... exec ImageMagick convert instead of using GD for the  
resize.

Sorry guys.  iPhone prematurely sent that.

The other idea is to buffer the download of the file. You can use  
fopen/fread/fclose to make sure you only keep say 1mb of data in php's  
memory while you download the file.  Usually urls can be treated like  
files via php's url file wrappers unless those have been disabled.

Or you can just
ini_set('memory_limit', '1500m');
Or however much memory you have available for the script and see if  
you can get by.

Really though, there's no reason a script like this needs to use so  
much memory.

Sometimes when running batch scripts, i've seen memory usage continue  
to rise through the iterations for unknown reasons. In that case, I  
split the script so there's a master script that manages the queue and  
another script that I exec to run the operation. That way it's a  
separate process and memory is always cleaned up.

Good luck,
Rob

You are not releasing memory somewhere. Using sleep is not going to
help in clearing memory. Monitor your memory usage (memory_get_usage)
and see if your memory usage keeps climbing or if it's just 1 big
image that is causing the problem.

Alternatively, fork your script for each image if you are running it
from the command line, and on unix.

$maxForks = 20;
while ( $files2process ) {

$processFile = getNextFileURL();
for ( $i=0; $i<$maxForks; $i++ ) {

$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) {
  die('could not fork');
} else if ($pid) {
  // we are the parent
  $childPIDs[]	= $pid;
} else {
  ...process file...
 exit();
}

// Wait for all the children to finish
foreach($childPIDs as $pid) {
	pcntl_waitpid($pid, $status);
	echo '*** '.$pid. " ENDED\n";
}

}

Then a single image won't stop the whole process, the one image will
just cause one child process to exit. This would also speed things up
considerably since you can process multiple images at once. There are
obviously holes in the script, but they should be easy to fill.

Be aware that the system you are on may not have forking enabled. In
which case, forget my whole response.

Just noticed you said the images are only 15k. Weird. Well, even  
without seeing the code, I think the suggestions of switching to  
imagemagick or splitting up the script will solve it.

Nope, because that'll unset the eighth element!

You want unset($array[6]) :P

And then if you want to re-key the array: array_slice($array)

 wow, awesome brent, i like the forking idea.

question:
how are you getting $files2process.? i'm assuming you're reading a directory if it were local, but can you get this number remotely from cURL?

thanks

You are not releasing memory somewhere. Using sleep is not going to
help in clearing memory. Monitor your memory usage (memory_get_usage)
and see if your memory usage keeps climbing or if it's just 1 big
image that is causing the problem.

Alternatively, fork your script for each image if you are running it
from the command line, and on unix.

$maxForks = 20;
while ( $files2process ) {

$processFile = getNextFileURL();
for ( $i=0; $i<$maxForks; $i++ ) {

$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) {
  die('could not fork');
} else if ($pid) {
  // we are the parent
  $childPIDs[]  = $pid;
} else {
  ...process file...
 exit();
}

// Wait for all the children to finish
foreach($childPIDs as $pid) {
    pcntl_waitpid($pid, $status);
    echo '*** '.$pid. " ENDED\n";
}

}

Then a single image won't stop the whole process, the one image will
just cause one child process to exit. This would also speed things up
considerably since you can process multiple images at once. There are
obviously holes in the script, but they should be easy to fill.

Be aware that the system you are on may not have forking enabled. In
which case, forget my whole response.

My guess is that you are not calling imagedestroy() after you are done
with the image handle.  You have to manually free the memory with GD.
This generally isn't a problem with web processes, because everything
is cleaned up at the end of the request.

John Campbell

We're destroying each handle after we're done with it, so I'm not  
exactly sure where the leak is, but it looks like it was introduced  
after we added the resizing methods.  Might as well give ImageMagick a  
whirl.  (I'd post the script, but have to edit it significantly first.)

I had a similar problem and I  added some old fashioned debug code  
using "echo" and "memory_get_usage" to see where the leaks were.

It really helped, and it's very educational. (and fun...)

That's one of the "holes" in the script. You can make it an array, a
function, a counter, whatever. Some way of processing your list of
files. Change it from while to for loop if needed. You just need some
way to go through the list of files, assigning the url of the next one
to the $processFile variable, which the child/forked process will
process.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] updating code from php 3 to 5.2.6: pity me!
Message-ID: <721f1cc50906051137v71766b6bm1dc4a3678cdf159c@mail.gmail.com>

Just want you all to feel sorry for me for a second.

Once upon a time, in the days of PHP3, someone coded a site (ok, it was me).
Besides being a poster child for some of the world's worst practices, this
code presumes register_globals and does a  lot of other long-deprecated
things. At long last, I am migrating to  a new host and updating to PHP5.
And discovering, for example, that there's no such thing as HTTP_POST_VARS
any more.  I am also introducing a nifty new language construct knowns as
'foreach.' Gonna to be doing a lot of grepping and perl -i -p -e '/bad
code/good code/g' today.

End of whine.

Not sure if you're kidding or not, but just use $_POST instead.

And btw I also found a copy of cgi-lib.pl lying around. Raise your hand if
you're old enough to remember cgi-lib.pl.

Egads!!! It's time to throw the whole program out and start from  
scratch. It would probably be quicker, easier and more stable in the  
long run just to start over.

I have a Yahoo! Pipe set up for just this purpose, if you want to use 
it. Just json_encode() your array, POST it via cURL to the appropriate 
URL, and parse the resulting RSS feed.

Greetings,

Any recommendations for a class to handle CSV files?  Import CSV file,
header parsing, and CSV file output required - exception handling preferred.

What sort of exceptions? Do you expect to be able to provide some sort of
schema for the CSV columns and expect it to do type checking? What do you
mean by CVS output? Do you want to alter some of the columns of the data,
provide some sort of enrichment and write a new file? Do you want to make
CVSs from another data source?
You are being quite vague.

Hi Justin,  I should have left exception handling out (it is the least
important, though I'd like some handling around file access errors).  

 

I want to import CSV files for a given month (file formats are identical),
concatenate their contents (without including headers from each file), and
output the concatenated CSV file to disk.  I do not need to alter data in
the files, nor perform any type checking.

What sort of exceptions? Do you expect to be able to provide some sort of
schema for the CSV columns and expect it to do type checking? What do you
mean by CVS output? Do you want to alter some of the columns of the data,
provide some sort of enrichment and write a new file? Do you want to make
CVSs from another data source?

 

You are being quite vague.

Ladies and gents,

What's the latest greatest best practice for setting up an SSL-encrypted
area of a site? Do we recommend creating a subdomain like ssl.example.org or
secure.example.org, to emphasize to the users that they're accessing an
SSL-secured site? Or is it not really necessary? Pros and cons?

That approach can minimize long-term costs -- funneling all secure
traffic through one subdomain means that you only need a single
commercially-signed certificate. That server can act as a reverse
proxy for other internal servers with self-signed certificates if
necessary.

Message-ID: <a304e2d60906081108r7e8520e8lab928133f6f0b285@mail.gmail.com>

People,

I have a directory /home/vlieu set to 754 permission and inside that
directory I have a
file with permission of 744.
drwxr-xr--  4 vlieu  www   4096 Jun  8 10:19 /home/vlieu
-rwxr--r-- 1 vlieu vlieu 1023 Jun  8 10:19 /home/vlieu/bid.csv


When accessing the bid.csv file  using a php program the function
is_readable()
fails.  I guess because the apache server runs the php file as user
'nobody'.

If I make the directory 755 (drwxr-xr-x) user nobody can read the bid.csv
file but if I make
the permissions 754 (drwxr-xr--) user nobody can not read the file.  WHY?
In a 754 permission all users still have read permissions...what am I
missing?

Thanks,

Nestor

Directory read only gives permission to see file names within the
directory, not to find out anything else about them (such as whether
they, themselves, are readable), or even to read them.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Basic_Permissions

The execute bit must be set on a directory in order to access files within it.

Directories need x permissions in order to be traversed. That's the
difference.

I've used it before...it's pretty good, but had some minor issues,

Hey,

Have you searched for exploits for this 3.7 version? Who knows, maybe 
something is public and hasn't been patched yet. Also, I'd do a little 
research
and see if someone is distributing some kinda vBulletin pwnage attack 
suite or similar. If you can find something, dig through the source and 
I'm sure you can
secure against such attacks.

I can't imagine there are tons' of 0days for this type of stuff sitting 
around...its got to surface sooner or later.

Also, maybe you could log all SQL queries (if you feel its SQL 
injection) - You'll quickly find the offending query. However, I find it 
hard to believe that
any modern, up to date web application is not using binded queries. But 
who knows. I have zero experience with vBulletin.

Another option would be to setup a honey pot with vBulletin on it. 
You'll find the exploit with that, probably rather quickly, but this 
does require a good amount of effort
if your new to honey pots.

Good luck - and let us know,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Header()  Redirect!!
Message-ID: <20090611.183128.2471.0@webmail08.dca.untd.com>

Hi everybody!
I need help in redirecting my link to a different page within my website. I read the manuan on "Header" function and it stae:
Remember that header() must be called before any actual output is sent, either by normal HTML tags, blank lines in a file, or from PHP. It is a very common error to read code with include(), or require(), functions, or another file access function, and have spaces or empty lines that are output before header() is called. The same problem exists when using a single PHP/HTML file. 
<html>
<?php
/* This will give an error. Note the output
 * above, which is before the header() call */
header('Location: http://www.example.com/');
?> If this statement is true, then how do you use header() function in any script that does not contain any "normal HTML tags" since you typically have to output something, whether before or after the call to the header()? It seems to me that type of rule is basically narrows the scope of the script to a very limited thing you can do, such as you can output the registration form to browser to allow the users to fill out the form, which is what I'm trying to. To be specifically, when a page is open, I present (output) a registration form to the users to register and when the user is finished with the form and I validate it and redirect that information to a different page sending those information along. That's all I'm trying to do--redirect from one page to the next without the end-user ever have to click on the link. Thanks in advance! Paul

You should place all of your PHP code that validates/redirects in the
beginning of the HTML/PHP file, BEFORE any HTML is spit out.

<?php
code to validate....
?>
<html>
<form>
...

</html>

Correct,

Have the page POST to itself, validate the form input in PHP and while 
still in PHP, redirect.
Otherwise, if you have errors, generate the applicable HTML.

Here's some pseudo code:

<?php

if (isset($_POST))
{
    //check data
    if (good) location('...');
    else
       echo "<FormWithErrorMessages>";
}
else
{
    echo "<DefaultForm>";
}

Hi everybody!
Sorry, I deleted the last thread about the page redirection. This is the guy that needs help with the page redirection.
Here is an abreviated code that I wanted to accomplish:
<?php
if ( !isset($_POST['Username']) && !isset(_POST['Password']))
  {
   <form action="<?=$PHP_SELF?>" method="post">
   <table>
   <tr><td>Username</td><td><input type="text" name="Username" size="30"></td></tr>
   <tr><td>Password</td><td><input type="password" name="Password" size="30"></td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td><input type="submit" value="Log in" id="submit"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
  </form>
    }
else
    {
     // Handle the incoming Post array from Login form above
     $LoginName     = $_POST['Username'];
     $LoginPass     = $_POST['Password'];
    //Validate code here
    //If OK, 
   header("Location: http://www.example.com/myPage.php");
  exit;
 }
?>
Is there something is wrong?
I tested it and it didn't give any error, but didn't redirect the page either.
Any help?
Thanks!
Paul

The way I use header redirects is by first having a script that generates 
output and includes some sort of a form (can even be a static page). That form 
gets submitted to a script that evaluates the parameters and values passed and 
based on that redirects to other scripts that generate particular content.

So yes, there is a good possibility that the script using the redirect never 
generates any output. BUT, some craft their applications using only a few 
files that each are a huge switch statement with various blocks of code. In 
those cases the first block can very well generate output whereas the second 
block has the redirects. It is just that when the second block gets called the 
first block is not executed. So it doesn't matter what comes first within the 
script, but what ultimately gets sent to the browser first.
By the time the browser displays something it already got the header. So since 
the header is already sent you cannot modify it any longer. It's like trying 
to sign a check that you mailed yesterday and that the recipient already received.

hi,

    Include the class in the file and use classsName::functionName(). I hope
it helps..

You can also use output buffering for some interesting behavior

[ http://us3.php.net/manual/en/book.outcontrol.php ]

<?php
ob_start()
?>

<html>
 ....
</html>

<?php

if ($success)
{
  header("Location: /success");
}

ob_flush_clean()
?>

I prefer to set headers at the end of the script because it is at the end of
processing
a request that you are best able to do content-type negotiation and status
based redirection.

Assuming the class definition is in memory b/c the defining file is loaded
(require, include, auto-load),
you can call the method by either:
a) instantiating an object instance of the class and then calling the method
b) calling the method statically (having no object).

    Formalize this and you've got the paradigm that is (mis)-named MVC.

    Most web apps should (i) process input,  (ii) think,  then (iii) 
display something.  The thing that gets displayed is called a "view",  
and one of the jobs of the "controller" is to display a different "view" 
depending on what the application thought in stage (ii).  In a good 
system,  the controller is able to surround a "view" with a "layout" 
(visual shell:  all of the chrome that goes at the top of the page,  on 
the side and on the bottom) or be able to do a redirect,  or suppress 
the "layout" in case we want to send back,  say,  JSON or 
comma-separated text as an output.

    I think the roles of the controllers and views are non-controversial 
at this point,  but the role of the "model" is more controversial.  I 
like to call this architecture CAV (Controller-Action-View) since it 
reflects the organization of the code from the controller's viewpoint:  
the controller decides which action code to run,  the action code 
recalls data from the database,  changes data in the database or both,  
and then the controller displays a view.

    Although frameworks like Rails,  Symfony and CakePHP have promoted 
these ideas,  they may have also slowed the understanding of these 
ideas.  (We think they're a property of a specific,  complex,  product 
rather than a self-evident truth.)  A "micro-framework" that implements 
a powerful and complete controller can be implemented about 50 lines of 
PHP;  you don't even need to use objects.

    As David mentions,  you can also implement a "controller" by using 
switch statements or conditionals:  there the "actions" and "views" are 
chunks of code that are inside the switch blocks.  You can get the 
functional benefits of the CAV architecture this way,  but the trouble 
is that your actions and views are mixed in with the controllers in one 
big file,  and often it gets hard to maintain.  In a mature CAV 
architecture,  actions and views can be packed as individual source code 
files,  or as individual functions,  classes,  or methods.

    "MVC" frameworks add all kinds of bells and whistles to this idea,  
but this is the heart of how they work.

I know that web crawlers doen't execute javascript when indexing webpages.

 

Does the php get evaluated when indexing?  I'm thinking I does.

Your PHP code could definitely factor into SEO, take for example the  
difference between

http://somedomain.com/1/1/2/useless/17/article.php?id=567

versus

http://somedomain.com/articles/meaningfulname/specificstuff/page/2

The URL that is used to access your content could make a major  
difference. I'm not an SEO expert, but that is the difference between  
"search engine friendly URL" and it's opposite.  CMS usually include a  
"Search engine friendly" feature, you might want to consider making  
your URLs friendly.

As a server-side scripting language, PHP is evaluated by the webserver (on
the server) in response to a URI request.  PHP code never makes it to any
client (if the server is configured properly.)  (Generated) HTML (and other
content types) are returned to the browser or automated user agent.  Some
automated user agents do interpret javascript.

It looks like Michele's original snippet had the method marked as private.
That means by definition that the method can only be called from within the
class itself -- $this->somePrivateMethod()

As for static vs instance methods, I believe the best PHP5 practice is to
mark a method as static if you intend to call it statically, ditto for
instance methods, i.e., don't make them static. Offhand I forget which
transgressions are fatal and which are warnings, but I think the best
practice is well established.

Sorry I spoke too soon. I see Michele was talking about invoking dbConnect()
from within the private method (duh). On a second look it seems there may be
some confusion between procedural vs OO.

Yeah.  I was thinking since the server evaluates the page when it's
requested all it's getting is the resulting html.

 

If I can't get the php without it being evaluated, then I was getting the
search engines couldn't either.  I don't know why I bothered asking.  I
knew.

 

This is great for my client's client.  I was thinking javascript and then I
got off the phone and realized all was good.

No.  There was no confusion between procedural and OO.  I was calling a
procedural function from an OO function.  I was in a hurry to customize a
class with some queried data not from a database class, which I could have
been using, but from some old procedural code that I had written.  Everyone
is always in a hurry and want me to produce immediately.  Whether or not I
integrate a db class into the code or use procedural database code is not an
issue.

 

I thought I was missing something in doing that other than writing
procedural code in the OO.  I had a typo in my include.  I wasn't getting a
php error, though.  I was getting nothing, so I was running through the
possibilities of problems.  I wasn't quite sure what was going on.  It took
me a few minutes to find I typed $_SEVER[, not $_SERVER[.  I figured it out
right after I posted.  I typed require, too and also didn't get an error.
Usually, I get an include or require error.  That's why I was confused for a
second.

 

I've been planning on doing more OO code.  There really hasn't been much of
an opportunity, but I ran into some weird issues with a xajax class for more
than one object, so I thought for a NY minute that there was a weird issue,
but their wasn't.  I want to do more oo, but I don't really see the
advantage even though I know the argued advantages.  I think oo is just
hipper.  Now, Sir Francis Bacon's Four Idles would argue against this kind
of motivation, but that's my only real motivation.  Hipness.

 

My bad for posting.  Sorry.  I really don't need you guys for much anymore,
but sometimes I think if I run into a seeming problem I'll consult y'all.
In the past, y'all have been very helpful, but I'm maturing a little in my
development.  I'm really getting to be more independent.  Sorry, for the
silly posting.  I still sometimes want to post here, even though I don't'
need to much anymore.  For any silly, little issue, I think "I'll ask the
guys".  But, thanks for your consideration.  It is great that you guys are
here in case a person is in a real bind.

It looks like you are not actually displaying the PSD on the webpage.
The class just converts the PSD into a JPEG and then displays the JPG
to the browser. If you have Photoshop, I feel you might as well do
this yourself before uploading the image. Uploading JPGs versus PSD is
much faster and saves space anyway.

I guess it's cool that there is a class with these abilities, but I
can't see this being terribly useful. It's cool in those emergency
cases where you only have the PSD version of a file.

I could see this being really useful for designer websites or tutorial
websites where there is often a PSD available for download. No sense going
through the trouble of exporting a JPG if this can do it automatically.
One way or another, cracking the PSD format makes for fun code. I'll have to
try it out... and put some sort of caching on that example script, because
re-rendering it each request can not be fun.

This made the rounds of the internets a while back, but it's a bit related:

Paul, have you found your solution yet? (Yea, my reply here is quite  
late . . . have not been checking mail.)

Anyway, if you haven't the solution, here's the correct code . . .

<?php
   if (!isset($_POST['Username']) && !isset($_POST['Password']))
   {
?>
   <form action="" method="post">
   <table>
     <tr><td>Username</td><td><input type="text" name="Username"  
size="30"></td></tr>
     <tr><td>Password</td><td><input type="password" name="Password"  
size="30"></td></tr>
     <tr><td></td><td><input type="submit" value="Log in"  
id="submit"></td></tr>
   </table>
   </form>
<?php
   }
   else
   {
     // Handle the incoming Post array from Login form above
     $LoginName     = $_POST['Username'];
     $LoginPass     = $_POST['Password'];
     //Validate code here
     //If OK,
     header("Location: http://www.example.com/myPage.php");
     exit;
   }
?>

Hope this helps.
jc

My company or me is available for a regular part-time gig.

Preferably 20 hours a week.  No more than 30 hours a week.  (On occasion, I
could make exception and work more hours, but not on a regular basis.)

My company charges ridiculously low rates, plus I pick-up all the payroll
taxes.  Now that's a good deal.

If I were an employee, I have an unusual fringe benefit requirement, but my
salary request would be lower than scale.

So, if you need regular work but don't need a full-time employee or company,
I'm available.

The skill set is typical: php, javascript, html, css, ajax, wordpress,
zencart, a little Joomla, a little smarty and a little framework.

I've got about 2 years experience, but I do all the work on my websites and
am hired regularly to fix other websites.

I am available to work on site if below 42 street or in Jersey city.

If I seem to have a lot of demands for someone looking for work that's
because I already have work.  I'm just putting my feelers out.

Bloomberg won't give me a reference, but in my six month review all that had
to say was "Where do you get your integrity?"

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Trying to decide between MDB2 and PHP PDO
Message-ID: <8632023a0906251302n32706267p1ee4fead4449823f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to decide whether to use MDB2 or PHP PDO. I am sort of leaning
towards using PHP PDO at the moment, but I'd rather ask some experts on
their opinion. Just fyi, I am using PHP 5.2.6-1+lenny3 and mySQL on a Linux
server, I have created a table of about 20 fields and loaded 20,000 rows of
data into the table. I then ran a select with a where clause and an update
on every row, while testing performance of MDB2 and PHP PDO. I also tested
whether a raw statement query to the server would be faster than forming a
prepare statement and then executing using both MDB2 and PHP PDO.

In my tests I found that using raw statements in MDB2 and PHP PDO is faster
than using a prepare statement and then executing it for each row (raw
statement was much faster using MDB2 and only slightly faster using PHP
PDO). To capture the times I issued a microtime() just before the
query/execute and just after.

For processing 20,000 transactions:

Here are my results for the MDB2 raw Select php program:

-  ran for 10.1 seconds vs 17.7 seconds for the prepare. The MDB2 raw update
ran for 12.3 seconds vs 20.3 seconds for the MDB2 prepare.

Here are my results for the PDO raw Select PHP program:

- ran for 8.3 seconds vs 8.3 seconds for the prepare. The PDO raw update ran
for 5.78 seconds vs 5.92 seconds for the PDO prepare.

I have pasted two of my programs' source code: the first uses prepares and
MDB2 and the second uses prepares and PHP PDO.

****I was told that using a prepare is much faster then using raw sql but my
test results prove otherwise. Why is the prepare and execute method is
slower than building the statement manually and querying the server?
Shouldn't the prepare and execute method be faster since you only need to
generate the prepare once as opposed to generating the statements within a
loop?

 From the result of your benchmark, I think I need to trace the PDO, MDB 
source.
It is very possible PDO and MDB doesn't do MySQL server side prepared 
statement, which
will increased the performance. PDO and MDB may just emulate JDBC doing 
fake client
side prepared statement, which will not increase the speed for each query.

But I guess until I look a PDO and MDB, my answer is just a guess.

The "prepare is faster" lie was started as a conspiracy to trick the
idiots into using prepared statement for security reasons.  Prepared
statements are typically twice as slow because you have to talk to the
database twice, and in your case, they are about the same as not using
a prepared since you are doing repeated queries.

>From your data, it looks like MDB2 is probably doing something stupid
under the hood and possibly re-preparing in each iteration.

I think MDB2 and PDO offer some sort of "Emulate Prepared Statements"
mode, and I would re-run your tests using that.

Personally, I find PDO pointless, and MDB2 overkill.  Any reason you
are ruling out mysqli?

Wait, are you advocating //against// prepared statements?

It's a pretty well known fact, or at least I thought so, that MySQL
doesn't cache prepared statement opcodes and must re-compile them
every time ::execute() is called, whereas a better RDBMS (correct me
if I'm wrong, I believe postgres does) will cache the prepared
opcodes; granted, you're not going to see some great huge speed
improvement unless you're running ridiculous queries that ought to be
stored procedures anyhow.  I still don't understand the hate for
prepared statments, as they are inherently more secure and allow a
greater flexibility with data type checks, as well as making your code
look a whole hell of a lot cleaner if deployed properly.

And why the hate for PDO?

Hi, I work with Kevin. Our application needs to run on both mySQL and Oracle
so we are looking for portability. We currently are using PEAR DB and we are
looking into moving to MDB2 or PDO so we thought it would be a good idea to
test performance before we make a decision. Amazing what you find when you
dig ...

Thanks for the ideas and perspective

Not at all, but when using mysql, you should emulate them.  I am
actually all for "prepared" style queries, if I ever see
"mysqli_real_escape_string" in someone's code, I immediately write the
person off as clueless.

> And why the hate for PDO?

I don't see what it offers.  It is too verbose for my taste:

I like to be able to write:
$posts = $db->sql("SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT ?,?",$offset,$length)->fetchAll();

To achieve this, I have to wrap whatever I am using, and I have found
PDO to be slower and more buggy than mysqli.

John Campbell

Clearly you're working a few levels above where I am, which is not 
saying much, to be fair.

What techniques are we talking about here that make this function obsolete?

Thanks,

a.k.a. prepared statements?

Okay, got it.  Thanks much for the clue.  Got some reading to do now...

i'd recommend adodb as your php db interface library:

Mainly b/c of it's variety of supported query types.  it's quite nice.
Notice the seamless and consistent parameter escaping as well.

If you actually do expect to need agile portability between databases, the
application level programming interface is secondary.  Really think about
your schema (column types, return types, constraints, etc) and queries (join
behavior, optimizations, transactions, limitations, etc).

Most performance impact will come with the right indexes/queries/etc. and
retrieval/storage strategies - not a couple of function calls here or there.
Plus, it's generally much easier to scale up web servers than databases, so
that'll be the first pressure point to worry about.

For a "database abstraction" layer, write a simple class and interface to
wrap the database's native drivers.  In 2 hours you can write a lightweight
class around mysqli and OCI that fits your application perfectly, gives a
consistent interface, actually increases application flexibility and overall
portability, and gives your code a solid code base to be built on top of.
Plus it'll probably be faster.  There's not really a lot of sense in my
opinion to put another layer of code between what your application wants to
do, and what the database actually can do.

What's so clueless about using mysql_real_escape_string()?  I would be
interested to find out.

Nothing in my opinion.  Prepared statements can be a benefit in various
situations, with those benefits being largely dictated by the database in
use.  With MySQL, prepared statements often are an actual drag, rather than
benefit.

Consider:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/c-api-prepared-statements.html

A key statement being:

"Prepared execution is an efficient way to execute a statement more than
once."

Most statements aren't executed more than once in a typical web
application/request/response cycle.

Cases where I would use prepared statements:

-- batch processes where the same queries are executed numerous times with
varying data

-- dealing with large data storage (blobs, etc.)

If, and this is an enormous if, you properly build your application
around persistent connections, you ought to be able to take advantage
of the erm, advantages of preparing your statements.  AFAIK, the cache
for prepared statements (which I'm not entirely sure MySQL even
bothers to build and use, I've heard that it doesn't and after several
hours of searching have given up looking for a conclusive answer)
exists on a per connection basis, so the persistency of your
connection ought to preserve that gain.  As a general rule, I use
parameterized queries with named parameters (a huge advantage PDO has
over MySQLi) in all my queries, because I can afford the extra wait if
the query only runs once on that connection and it's far too easy to
rely on mysqli_real_escape_string and forget to use it once and have
everything come crashing down around you.  As far as portability is
concerned, one thing I've had some level of success with is storing my
queries in XML and fetching them to be prepared, then binding and
executing, which makes it a whole hell of a lot easier to write
queries for two different databases (in my case, PostgreSQL and MySQL)
than try to implement some sort of rewriter, generator, or some other
language that gets compiled into SQL (think Doctrine).

Regarding have another layer between your code and your database
(driver), I would have to disagree (and Hans and I have had a back and
forth off list about this very thing).  Consider PDO:
PDO call -> PDO -> driver -> database
Now consider a userland implemented DBAL:
DBAL call  -> DBAL -> driver -> database

They look exactly the same! The primary difference being whether the
extra layer of abstraction is implemented in C or in the userland and
Common Wisdom has always (as far as I know, once again) suggested that
it's very rare that userland code will outperform something with the
same functionality written in C.  I think the OP's benchmarks agree,
but once again, do a few milliseconds really matter that much when the
actual query is going to steal most of the time? Probably not, unless
you're choking on CPU time, rather than I/O queue, which is very
rarely the case.  And as far as the native driver thing goes, the
difference is how the driver is implemented, but in the end it's the
same driver being used.  The main argument against PDO that I've heard
is that some of the quirks and non-standard behaviors that the various
RDBMS's offer isn't handled, but in writing portable apps, consider
whether or not using database-specific behavior is really a good idea.
 I personally don't think it is.

tl;dr: I'm a PDO fanboy

Kevin already stated that he has a need for MySQL/Oracle portability so 
the following does not likely apply, but this 3 year old article is an 
interesting read:

http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/08/13/four-types-of-database-abstraction-layers/

What are your thoughts on the following paragraph?

"I generally dislike Type 3 software, and I think anyone who?s ever 
written serious applications that require real performance from a 
database system will probably agree, for fairly obvious reasons. For one 
thing, platform-independent SQL is a myth. Easy and/or painless 
conversion between different database systems is, too. It does not exist 
in the real world. And I don?t agree with those who assert it?s a common 
requirement, or that it would be a good thing. I think porting from one 
system to another is generally rare, and trying to write ?portable? 
systems when there?s no clear need is going to cause nothing but problems."

Hi, have you already considered an ORM tool to deal with it for you?

Your situation seems to reflect the exact need for it.

Here is the list of some:
Doctrine
Propel
Outlet
dORM
Lumine

Personally I use Doctrine. It's the most complete of all. That's why  
in 2007 I onboarded the project! :-)

Cheers,

String interpolation (using double quoted strings) is inherently
dangerous.  All it takes is forgetting to call
mysql_real_escape_string, *once* and you have a nasty vulnerability.
It also makes for really bloated code.  To fix the problem, you just
have to stop using double quoted strings.

consider this:
$sql = "SELECT title from posts WHERE YEAR(posted_at)=$year"

Looking at the above code, you have no way to know if that is safe or
not.  You cannot reason about it unless you trace the "$year" back to
its source.  Are you sure it can't become:
$sql = "SELECT title from posts WHERE YEAR(posted_at)=2008 UNION
SELECT id as title from sessions";

Now an example without string interpolation:
$sql = sqlf('SELECT title from posts WHERE YEAR(posted_at)=%d',$year);

We know the above code is safe regardless of the value of $year.  The
internals of this 'sqlf' function may call "mysql_real_escape_string",
or it may use prepared queries, but the point is that we can reason
that this style of coding will never let us down.  If you want a good
"sqlf" type function, see wordpress,drupal, or pretty much any open
source project that uses a database.  They all write their queries
this way.

If I am looking at someone else's code and it is loaded with
"mysql_real_escape_string", I must just blindly trust that they
haven't made one mistake anywhere in the code.

To me the issue prepared, vs. non prepared.  It is that escaping
strings + string interpolation is inherently prone to mistakes.

John Campbell

Subject: [nycphp-talk] oci8 bind error
Message-ID: <A972109D0D5B45B39250BF76CC5B65D0@Libby>

I'm getting the following error using oci_bind_by_name(). 

Warning: oci_bind_by_name(): ORA-01036: illegal variable name/number in
/appl/wideacc/CustMast/in/OCIpreptest.php on line 23

 

As you can see by the commented out bind lines, I have tried many different
parms in the bind and I tried the insert with the field names and without

 

I was getting the error on a "real" table so to isolate the issue I created
a test table with one field in it (the field is a varchar(25) and called
TESTNAME)

We are running php 5.2.2 with oci8 1.2.3 (rev 1.269.2.16.2.32),  against
Oracle 10g rel 10.2.0.2.0 on SunOS ver 5.10

 

What makes this even stranger, if I do not "die" on the failure of the bind
the oci_execute() returns true but no row is inserted into the table.

I can get this to work with PEAR_DB and MDB2 but we are doing some
performance testing so we want to see how using oci direct without any DB
layers performs.

Below is the test code I'm running;


//Connect to the Database 
$dbUser  = 'c1'; 
$dbPSWD  = p1'; 
$db = 'db1';  
$con = oci_connect($dbUser, $dbPSWD, $db); 
if (!$con) die ('Connect to DB failed'); 
//$insSQL = 'INSERT INTO KB_TEST (TESTNAME) VALUES (:TESTNAME)'; 
$insSQL = "INSERT INTO KB_TEST  VALUES (:TESTNAME)"; 
$insSQL = strtoupper($insSQL); // upper case since ORACLE prefers upper and
we know we do not have a case issue
echo "SQL is $insSQL \n"; 
$stmt = oci_parse($con, $insSql); 
if (!$stmt) die ('Parse for insert failed'); 
//oci_bind_by_name ($stmt, ":TESTNAME", "ERIC", 25, SQLT_CHAR); 

//oci_bind_by_name ($stmt, ":TESTNAME", "ERIC");

//oci_bind_by_name ($stmt, ":TESTNAME", "ERIC",-1);

//oci_bind_by_name ($stmt, ':TESTNAME', 'ERIC');

//oci_bind_by_name ($stmt, ':TESTNAME', 'ERIC',-1);
$val = 'ERIC'; 
$bindVar = ':TESTNAME'; 
if (oci_bind_by_name ($stmt, $bindVar, $val)) { 
        echo "Bind Successful \n"; 
}  else { 
        oci_close($con); 
        die ("***** Bind Failed ***** "); 
   } 
if (oci_execute ($stmt)) { 
        echo "execute was good \n"; 
} else { 
        echo "excute FAILED \n"; 
  } 
oci_close($con);

Wanted to post my results.  I have successfully created a zip code  
radius function on my site, similar to a store locator.  Here's a  
brief recap:

1)  Geocoded around 31,000 addresses sitting in my database, using  
Google Maps API (http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=80200&topic=11364 
).  Modified the goodle sample code to fit my needs.  One important  
thing to note, I was getting lots of bad responses from the API.  I  
was able to fix this by adding "&oe=utf8" to the end of the request url.

2)  Downloaded and modified this free zip code radius class (http://www.micahcarrick.com/04-19-2005/php-zip-code-range-and-distance-calculation.html 
).

3)  Downloaded the 1990 census bureau list of zips and geo coordinates  
(http://www.census.gov/tiger/tms/gazetteer/zips.txt) to use as a start  
point for the range lookup.  More info on the census lists here (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html 
).

4)  My code currently produces a text list of locations.  I would like  
to add the visual google maps display with place markers.  It's not an  
essential feature and I'll add as time allows.  Will post results on  
that later if it happens.

Thanks for everyone's helpful suggestions!  Much appreciated.

-Aaron

I would like to add spell check to a <textarea> field in one of my  
forms.  I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for a php class  
and/or javascript/ajax function that they liked?

I did some quick searching for php and/or javascript spell checkers  
and found a bunch of results but would like to hear if folks have  
experience or recommendations to share.

Thanks,

Adding the maps display with google is pretty easy.  At this point you
probably would have fun building this out on an iPhone with the new 3.0
Mapkit.  You can get pretty crazy with all the geocoding features in Xcode.

Drop zillions of Google "Pins" out of the sky, it's can get crazy.

PS.  here's +90 links for mapping I've been collecting, lots of code to
experiment with:

Many of the wysiwyg textarea tools (tinyMCE, Xinha, etc) support spell- 
checking (via pspell on the server)

You could use one, either stripped down, or as inspiration to roll  
your own.

Well, Firefox comes with a spellchecker for form fields, but you can add a 
special editor like TinyMCE. I did that once a long time ago and it was very 
easy to do. That may be a bit too much for just getting spellchecking on a 
textarea.
