<PRE>Paul,

First of all, thank you for sharing all this information

In this case it seems like a client is already using SalesForce and asking
about doing some changes. So after this i've been asked about how many time
it would take for a developer to get into the platform

My first guess was a week, then i downloaded the manual (with &gt; 300 pages)
and i started thinking in two weeks, but if it's Java i don't think we'll be
able to take it. We are doing PHP mostly, also FB apps, ASP, AS, but not
Java

&gt;<i>From what you are telling me, it seems like we might need to develop in
</I>Java, not in PHP, is this correct?


best,
Fernando

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    I haven't made &quot;Salesforce pages&quot; (public-facing web sites that run on
</I>&gt;<i> the SF platform) but I have done some work with the API and I made it to
</I>&gt;<i> Dreamforce last year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   From a technical point of view,  you can develop public and private
</I>&gt;<i> facing SF applications with a system that's very similar to modern MVC
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks like CakePHP or symfony,  but you'd do coding in a language
</I>&gt;<i> called APEX,  which is derived from Java,  and the database is somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> between SQL and NoSQL.  There's a Web UI builder in the IDE for it,  so you
</I>&gt;<i> can build simple pages with very little coding -- I saw a demo aimed at
</I>&gt;<i> marketing people where they were able to knock up a form in the builder in
</I>&gt;<i> about five minutes.  Particularly looking at the API I see a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> similarities between the SF platform and the Facebook platform,  but SF is
</I>&gt;<i> really optimized for classic OLTP applications and doesn't have the
</I>&gt;<i> specializations for large social networks that you see in sites like FB or
</I>&gt;<i> LinkedIn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   That said,  I find the business of Salesfore puzzling.  I like building
</I>&gt;<i> web sites that are supported by advertising,  so think in terms of eCPM,
</I>&gt;<i>  which is typically between $0.25-$5.00 for the sites I make.  Pages hosted
</I>&gt;<i> on the SF platform cost $1.00 eCPM to host,  which would eat an unacceptable
</I>&gt;<i> amount of my profits...  Particularly when the costs of a more conventional
</I>&gt;<i> system (MySQL/PHP,  or MSSQL/ASP.NET) is probably 1/100 that assuming
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable scale and utilization.  SF has an ARPU of around $1000 a year...
</I>&gt;<i>  If it wasn't possible to provision a similar kind of service for 1/1000 the
</I>&gt;<i> price,  it wouldn't be possible for Facebook to exist.  You'd think,  given
</I>&gt;<i> the prices they charge,  SF would have good margins,  but according to what
</I>&gt;<i> they file with the S.E.C.,  Salesforce.com's margins are much much smaller
</I>&gt;<i> than those of Amazon Web Services!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In the back end,  SF has several big clusters that center around an
</I>&gt;<i> instance of Oracle 10g,  and they buy lots of gold plated hardware.  The
</I>&gt;<i> reliability of SF is excellent,  and performance is really good for OLTP
</I>&gt;<i> work,  but the platform is weak for analytics,  network analysis and
</I>&gt;<i> anything that doesn't fit into its paradigm...  They charge something like
</I>&gt;<i> $1K / month/ GB for database storage,  which is just nuts...  They could be
</I>&gt;<i> storing it in RAM for what they're charging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Overall,  if your company is already using SF and you want to build
</I>&gt;<i> applications that communicate with your SF database in an OLTP manner,  SF
</I>&gt;<i> pages are a reasonable way to go.  If you don't already have a commitment to
</I>&gt;<i> SF,  I'd stay away.  They like to recall the days that they were a
</I>&gt;<i> disruptive upstart,  but I think 10 years from now they're going to be seen
</I>&gt;<i> as an over-the-hill high cost provider.
