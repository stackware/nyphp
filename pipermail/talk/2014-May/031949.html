I'm still not convinced. Imagine you're making a calendaring
application and use local storage like you describe to draft events.
Then imagine a scenario where a user tries to schedule an appointment
while they're on the train and the internet cuts out. The appointment
is not actually scheduled until they visit the site again which by
then the event time may have already passed. Or maybe they used
another device. A lot of people have multiple devices now.

I think there certainly are cases where it is ok to store data on the
client. But it should not be anything someone would get remotely upset
about losing. And if it has to do with money, it's probably something
someone would care about.

Putting something in a shopping cart is a sort of transaction. You're
saying I am willing to purchase this particular item at this price. At
any point after that moment the item and/or price could change. The
item could sell out. A sale could expire.

Have you ever tried to buy plane tickets and a price changed on you
while you're sitting at the computer fiddling with times trying to
satisfy everybody's schedule? I think the airlines actually change
prices depending on website activity for particular flights. Bastards!
