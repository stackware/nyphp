I'm going out on a limb here, but I think generally "anything" is supported.

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-get-transports.php
http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-get-wrappers.php

I believe will list what's available by default, and you can register your own wrappers, which entails various behaviors on send/recv etc.

Hello

I'm trying to learn to set up MySQL database replication with two boxes on
which I have sufficient privileges to play, one that would be master is
Win2K running 3.23.51-max-nt-log; the would-be slave, a RH 7.2 box running
3.23.52

I follow the directions in Paul DuBois' MySQL [4] book verbatim. (He says,
match server versions, like use 3.23.x with 3.23.x but he doesn't say
anyting about not trying it cross-platform.) I set up the master and
restart and it seems ok. I set up the slave configuration thus

[mysqld]
# stuff snipped
# slave config
server-id=2
master-host=mintzd.nysd.circ2.dcn
master-user=slave
master-password=deep.secret

and I get a lot of this:


Number of processes running now: 2
mysqld process hanging, pid 23568 - killed
/usr/bin/safe_mysqld: line 262: kill: (23568) - No such process
030701 17:57:52  mysqld restarted
/usr/bin/safe_mysqld: line 273: 23593 Segmentation fault
$NOHUP_NICENESS $ledir/$MYSQLD $defaults --
basedir=$MY_BASEDIR_VERSION --datadir=$DATADIR $USER_OPTION
--pid-file=$pid_file --skip-locking >>$err_log 2>&1

Number of processes running now: 1
mysqld process hanging, pid 23596 - killed
030701 17:57:54  mysqld restarted
/usr/bin/safe_mysqld: line 273: 23617 Segmentation fault
$NOHUP_NICENESS $ledir/$MYSQLD $defaults --
basedir=$MY_BASEDIR_VERSION --datadir=$DATADIR $USER_OPTION
--pid-file=$pid_file --skip-locking >>$err_log 2>&1

This goes on and on until I kill it.

So I comment out the slave configuration lines and try again, and all is
well. I've repeated this several times, and hypothesize that it doesn't
like being enslaved, but I can't figure out why.

Any clues greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I'm not too surprised it bombed on Windows, but under RH it should have returned something, I'd think.  Any luck trying the other stream_get_* functions?

OS platforms shouldn't matter, but try bringing the MySQL versions up to 4.0.13.  According to: http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Replication_Problems.html it may help.

Message-ID: <46DAC58F-ACA6-11D7-87DB-003065569500@xylophage.com>

Hi all,

I have a question about user session id's showing up in apache access 
logs. We're trying to do some more in-depth analysis of our traffic and 
sessions came up, of course. My understanding of how PHP manages 
sessions is that it will propagate the ID in the URL if the browser 
doesn't support cookies. So how does a user session become apparent in 
the access logs when the visitor's browser does support cookies? I 
apologize if the answer to this question is painfully obvious...

Thanks in advance,
Winston

Just a thought, but I know Apache can log the username of the client, if
you use HTTP authentication. I know when I look at logs for parts of my
site which use Apache authentication, it does log my username in a
separate field. The relevant variable is $_SERVER["PHP_AUTH_USER"]. The
problem is that you may have to get users to authenticate themselves...
someone who has a deeper understanding of HTTP authentication should
comment here.

Well, that did get me thinking about environment variables -- I might 
be in danger of answering my own question, but is it as simple as 
disabling session.use_cookies in the .ini file?

Are you trying to log that session ID if using cookie-based sessions?

Here's an example from my httpd.conf file for the log format that includes
cookies:
        LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" \"%{Cookie}i\"" combinedcookie
...which simply adds \"%{Cookie}i\" to log the stock combined log format.
You'll get all cookies stored by your site, but at least you have the session
ID there for use.

I should also mention that if you're using Apache 2.0, you can log a specific
cookie value with %{cookiename}C ... See:
    http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats

Is it possible to batch print an entire mysql table in detailed view with php?

My work wants to be able to batch print the entire day's orders with a few clicks (in the detailed invoice view) and I don't think I can do it without getting all the invoices forwarded individually to say outlook and then have them batch printed there.

thanks,

Anyone here have any experience with bandwidth testing? Basically, I'm
looking to determine a website visitor's connection speed so I can direct
them to an appropriate media stream.

Looking for a PHP solution but an Javascript/applet one will work just fine.

Thanks!

This is probably old news for many of you, but I figured I'd pass it on.  I'm seeing a flurry unknown/unauthorized hits on our sites here at work, but the 'contestants' haven't proved anything yet.

Anyway, enjoy the 4th,

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030707220949.00b37300@mail.optonline.net>

Help!  I can do this stuff blindfolded in PHP but now I am forced to do 
some work on a windows server using ASP.
I hope you don't mind my imposing on you all for a tiny bit of help.

I have photos and legends for them in an array.  I pass a variable for 
which photo and legend to a display
script with no problem for the photo, but how do I pick up the variable for 
the array element?

Here are the relevant lines from the display script:
==========================
<img src="../images/chicago2003/<% =Request("which")  %>.jpg"><br />
<% response.write legend(2) %>
===========================

In the second line I have hard-wired element 2 just for testing, but 
obviously I want the ASP
equivalent of $legend($which).  Maybe I could figure out how to do this 
eventually, but I know
somebody out there can tell me how in 15 seconds.  TIA, and again I 
apologize for this OT question.

I know there is an asp list out there somewhere; if somebody can point me 
at that, I'll never have to
bother any of you with this stuff again--I hope.

It all depends on what your interests are actually.
Look for researches that the faculty are doing and see
if you want to be part of it. The websites of the
school department is a good start. Look also into the
tools and technology these researches are using. Stick
to the open source technologies.

Math expertise or the lack of it will factor in
depending on the specific field you want to go into. I
guess what I am saying is you have to know where to
start and proceed from there. It will also determine
if you want to get "married" into it.

Hope this helps.

My ASP's a bit rusty, but this may be what you need.

<%
Dim w
w = Request("which")
%>

<%= legend(w) %>

Quote from the article:
"Three years later, most of the hopes behind the .Net initiative have not
been realized," Helms said, adding that .Net has now almost vanished from

Message-ID: <IJELJIKLMLIOAJFOEKKFKEFLCEAA.wheelie@acedsl.com>

Hey All,

I'm working on a site and the client has made the username and password for
members of the site a combination of their ID and lastname. I know, it's
terribly unsecure, but none the less that's what I have to work with. So, a
username looks like 123456GLENN and the password (which is also their ID)
would be 123456. The ID of a member needs to be passed in the URL on
occasion and I was thinking of using some sort of encryption on the ID in
the URL. However, after looking at the different encryption methods I'm a
bit confused and wondering if anybody out there has a better idea.

Thanks,
Josh

If you really need to make your auth process virtually hack-proof, you
should use SSL. I've never used PHP's OpenSSL functions, but you might want
to check into it if that type of security is warranted.

The username/password scheme that has been chosen is just adding to the
probability that unauthorized access will occur, but maybe you want to
create a system where users can modify their own passwords, or use another
service to authenticate against a more secure user database. For example,
permissioning a group of users to access an FTP directory, then trying the
connection using PHP's FTP functions against the FTP service. On NT, this is
nice because you don't have to maintain another user database, and users can
change their domain passwords whenever they want (and it would filter down
to your app automatically).

As for passing user id's around, why not use sessions? They are easier to
work with and provide a little more security in that the user's credentials
aren't floating back and forth (although it doesn't address session
hijacking).

Hope it gives you some ideas.

When I have to auto-gen passwords, I typically base them off of some
other required information and encrypt/encode them one way or another
(and use a substring thereof) (depends if I need to be able to decrypt
them or not).

Like this, or some variation:

$passGenStr = $ID . $firstName;
$generatedPassword = substr(base64_encode($passGenStr), 3, 12);

at least this way it's (nominally) harder to figure out which part of
the base64_encoded string you've used.

Of course, somebody could figure out some way to decode them or reverse
engineer the process.

I would certainly never store them in the database without some form of
encryption/encoding (again, it depends if I need to be able to decrypt
them or not) regardless of what method I used to auto-gen the password
in the first place.

I would certainly advise against the method described in your original
email as it is far to easy to figure out.

Still, there is the issue of interception, but that's something else
entirely.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Proper File Downloads Across Browsers
Message-ID: <3F0C34E1.3060509@nyphp.org>


Hey all,

I've written a file/report manager for our Intranet, and it entails mostly of presenting a directory listing, some meta data, and then allowing the user to download the file, or if it's a zip, to browse it online.  Things have worked out smashingly, but I ran into some oddities when presenting a file for download.

I currently have something along the lines of:

      header('Content-type: application/x-download');
      header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename={$meta['filesaveas']}");
      readfile(DATADIR.$meta[FILE]);

This causes both IE and Mozilla to properly present the Save As dialog box, and save the file without munging the extension, etc.  However, I realize that application/x-download isn't a valid MIME type, so it's basically working by default, rather than by design.

I had originally used application/octet-stream for the Content-type, which worked with Mozilla, but IE 6.0 insisted it was a WinZip file and would append .zip to my prepared filename (which is generally .rpt for Crystal Reports).

If anyone has any best-practice ideas for the proper MIME type to use, I'd appreciate it.  To be safe, I'll need to support Netscape 4.7 and IE 5.5 or better versions of either.  I'd like to avoid browser detection if possible, but if someone has a surefire Browser Version => Content-Type mapping, I would toss get_browser() into the mix.


Thanks,

H

The header combination I've had the most luck with looks like:

> Content-Length: 181041
> Cache-Control: private
> Content-Type: application/x-zip-compressed

I still have some users who have to right-click and choose Save Target As.

I don't know of a magic MIME-type that works for all files, I thought
application/octet-stream was it, but if IE has associated that with zip
(or any other filetype) in the past, then good luck.

In other words, the MIME-type is more of an associative hint to the
browser-- if you use application/x-crystal-report, and instruct your
users to associate that with the proper application, then it will work
from there. If the reports are plain-text or html, then use the
appropriate mime type -- of course IE may act broken and try to suggest
a filename suffix that it will understand later when it doesn't have the
benefit of a content-type header to guide it. It's frustrating, but you
can see why they made it that way.

AFAIK, you can't create your own, true, superglobals.  Thus, there'd be no way to specify the variables_order for an userland var like $_XML (since it's not really a superglobal)

Yeah, but even an auto_included file is much later than when the real superglobals get created.  To emulate user defined superglobals at runtime, I've done the nasty:

$_SERVER['XML'] = array('new','york','php');

function foo() {
   echo implode('-',$_SERVER['XML']);    new-york-php
}


Which keeps an array named XML out of the global namespace; otherwise, $GLOBALS is probably best.

Since PDF is just text, why not gzip, bzip2 or even zip?  For example,

$compressed = `/usr/bin/gzip -c something.pdf`;

[those are backticks]

And I think newer versions of PHP support this type of thing internally via http://us2.php.net/zlib

I forgot about the Content-Length;  that's probably a good call in general.

I can? :)

In my situation, the user won't have a registered application for the file they download, so my best bet will be to force a download.  Oddly enough, I've found if you put application/lalala (gibberish) as the MIME  sub-type, all browsers will download it.  So, by default, not design - ahh, good ol' MIME

Thanks,

I know I wasn't specific enough, when I said "compress".
Raw PDF format is just text. However contents of a PDF file can be optimized (compressed). I'm not looking to create a .zip or .gz file (that would be a nobrainer). I want to compress the PDF file "internally". Most PDF's created with Acrobat/Distiller are already compressed.
If you download this PDF:
http://www.tax.state.ny.us/pdf/2000/wt/nys45mn_100.pdf
and open it in a text editor, you'll see that some parts are binary.
Those are FlateCoded content streams.
 
The file I'm working with was created with Adobe Illustrator and saved as raw PDF (text only). I need raw PDF to use it as a template (by preg_replacing some "variable text").  The problem is that the file is 700Kb (way too big for this web app).  When I open it and save optimized in Adobe Distiller, the size is reduced to 195Kb, but the compressed file can not be used directly as a template anymore.
I could take two different routes:
1) use the raw PDF file as a template > preg_replace some text > compress the new PDF > send it to the client
 
2) use an already compressed PDF file as a template > fetch and uncompress the FlateCoded streams > preg_replace some text > recompress the modified content > send the new PDF to the client.
 
I know I could also use PDF4PHP to create a compressed PDF file from scratch but for performance reasons I really wanted to stick to using a template file. I searched the web but could not find any ready code specifically for what I want to do. I'm looking under the hood of the PDF4PHP class (it support FlateDecode compression) to get an idea how to uncompress the compressed streams. Any suggestions, pointers or code would be greatly appreciated.
 
Cheers,
Jerry

Total newbie question. I'm trying to create a web page that will include a 
complete secure page from page from a site where I am an affiliate. My 
goal, eventually, is to put this secure page in a table on one of my pages. 
As the first step, I've learned to embed using Yahoo as an example. But 
when I change the URL from Yahoo to the secure page, I'm getting error 
messages.

The example below (url_test04.php) substitutes XXXs for the affilaite ID 
code but in reality I'm using the right code and it opens normally in my 
browser.

here's what works:

QUOTE

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

<?php

$theurl='http://www.yahoo.com';

  if (!($fp = fopen($theurl, 'r'))) { echo 'Could not open URL'; exit; } 
$contents = fread($fp, 1000000);

echo $contents;

?>

</body>

</html>

END QUOTE

But when I change to:

$theurl='https://secure.onlineaccess.net/cart/manage.php?ID= XXXXXXXXXX' ;

I get the following errors:

Warning: Unable to access 
https://secure.onlineaccess.net/cart/manage.php?ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXX in

Could not open URL

Suggestions greatly appreciated regarding what I'm overlooking.

I presume you realize that the manage.php script/page must be on a machine
that's set up to handle SSL?  From the error message being thrown it appears
this might not be the case.
 
Hope this helps

Subject: [nycphp-talk] embedding one web page in another


Total newbie question. I'm trying to create a web page that will include a
complete secure page from page from a site where I am an affiliate. My goal,
eventually, is to put this secure page in a table on one of my pages. As the
first step, I've learned to embed using Yahoo as an example. But when I
change the URL from Yahoo to the secure page, I'm getting error messages.

The example below (url_test04.php) substitutes XXXs for the affilaite ID
code but in reality I'm using the right code and it opens normally in my
browser.

here's what works:

QUOTE

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

<?php

$theurl='http://www.yahoo.com';

 if (!($fp = fopen($theurl, 'r'))) { echo 'Could not open URL'; exit; }
$contents = fread($fp, 1000000);

echo $contents;

?>

</body>

</html>

END QUOTE

But when I change to:

$theurl='https://secure.onlineaccess.net/cart/manage.php?ID= XXXXXXXXXX' ;

I get the following errors:

Warning: Unable to access
https://secure.onlineaccess.net/cart/manage.php?ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
<https://secure.onlineaccess.net/cart/manage.php?ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXX>  in
/home/virtual/site1/fst/var/www/html/url_test04.php on line 13

No such file or directory in
/home/virtual/site1/fst/var/www/html/url_test04.php on line 13
Could not open URL

Suggestions greatly appreciated regarding what I'm overlooking.

Thanks for the response and I apologize for yet another newbie question.

What does "manage.php script/page" mean? I'm still learning the 
terminology.  Is it a way of saying that the secure page I'm trying to 
reach must be on my server?

I'm not sure if it's such a newbie question as it's not something I've
ever tried. Anyone else? How about you, Hans? You seem to have been
through a lot. :)

Wouldn't you be creating an insecure page by attempting to embed an SSL
page into a non-SSL page (assuming url_test04.php is in a non-secure
location)?

Are you certain that you compiled php with OpenSSL?

Sorry, that's still terminology beyond my expertise.

All I can tell you is that I created a page that calls up Yahoo. Then I put 
in on the server and it worked. When I created and installed another page, 
identical to the first except for an HTTPS URL, it returned errors saying 
the secure page couldn't be found.

Yet entering the identical secure URL into the browser's address field 
bring up that page.

I'm sure there's a logic for it but it escapes me.

I truly appreciate the help here.

Thanks again . . .

Do you know about phpinfo()?

create a page called

info.php

with the contents of

<?
phpinfo();
?>

view the page... it should have some mention of OpenSSL being enabled, etc.

as others here may advise, don't leave that page up and open to the public.

Joe,

You use this line of code:

 if (!($fp = fopen($theurl, 'r'))) { echo 'Could not open URL'; exit; }
$contents = fread($fp, 1000000);

According to the manual, (http://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php), with
regards to the fopen() and other simialr functions:

<Quote>
Note: HTTPS is supported starting from PHP 4.3.0, if you have compiled in
support for OpenSSL.
</Quote>

So....sure you can get to https:/somepage in your browser, BUT in PHP, you
need to have OpenSSL support enabled in order to use https in an fopen() call.

You might not know what OpenSSL support means, just know that everyone's PHP
engine can be different, and you need this OpenSSL component to do what you
want to do.


HTH

needs to be at least php 4.3

I think you should upgrade for security purposes as well.

I'm using 4.4.2 and OpenSSL appears to be enabled.

So far, I seem to be doing that and I seem to be compliant in all respects. 
Further advice will be greatly appreciated.

You said in an earlier post that you were using 4.2.2 -- which would not be
sufficient.

OOPPS - I transposed the version. I wrote 4.4.2 at one point and then did 
the right way later. Sory about that.  I am definitely running 4.2.2.

But the point is, do you think if I upgrade to 4.3 that will resolve the 
problem?

I run the site on a Rackshack dedicated server that I manage. Is upgrading 
as simple as uploading and overwriting the older PHP with the latest 
version or is this going to get hairy and play havoc with the sites I'm 
hosting that are built with 4..2.2?

Let me revise my question.

I note that 4.3.3RC1 has been out for more than 3 weeks and PHP 5.0.0 beta 
1 has been available for a bout two weeks. Should I upgrade to just 4.3 or 
the RC or the 5 beta?

Or maybe wait for the full 5 release? Any idea when that's due?

Same questions stand about how daunting and risky a task it is likely to be 
for me to try my own upgrade.

Thanks

Is upgrading as simple as uploading and overwriting the older PHP with the
latest 
version or is this going to get hairy and play havoc with the sites I'm 
hosting that are built with 4..2.2?
=======================================
Yes, it is that easy to upgrade, but make sure you test everything first. We
ran into an issue with 4.3.1's mssql_bind function not working properly, but
it was fixed in 4.3.2. Just make sure you have a plan to revert in case
things don't go as expected.

I'm not sure which version started defaulting to register_globals being OFF,
but if things do not work properly, you can try turning them on in the .ini
file as a temporary solution (that's if your sites do not all use
superglobal references). Just note that having them on is less secure, and
you should eventually try to clean up any existing code to use the new
method. If there are a number of people publishing to this box, there is a
good chance some sites are using the old, ugly method. Something to keep in
mind...

Well for upgrading PHP I would say that you should go to the stable
release if it is on a production server. If it is something that you dont
care if it goes up and down, then I wouldnt use it. (like 5.0 beta:D)

Another thing is that if you fopen a php script, does it open up the
source, or the compiled html? If it opens the source, than that would not
work properly, at least i think... :D

If you are talking about opening a remote url with fopen,
It works the same as if you opened the url in web your browser.

You get whatever the remote web server sends you in response to your HTTP(S) request.

Negative on going with the 5 beta, unless you want to develop/test it.  Go with 4.3.2 to get things off the ground, and then hit 4.3.3 when it's released.

Months...

The server fairy tells me that you're probably using the Ensim control panel, and making your own upgrade *might* be problematic, especially if you haven't done it before.  It's unfortuneate, since 4.3.x is very nice, but depending on your environment (the level of mission criticalness/time you can spend on it/) swaping in a non-Ensim component may cause you grief.

Simply, HTTPS is a very differant animal than HTTP, and using curl in this case may be your best bet:  http://us2.php.net/curl

Which, after a check of your phpinfo() output, should show that it's SSL enabled.

HTH,

Ahh, I knew it seemed too easy.  I'm sure you've been over http://us2.php.net/pdf

Wish I could help more; to me, it's better to receive a PDF :)

Joe,
While you need at least PHP 4.3.0 to make https requests using the fopen() function,  you may use the CURL functions to open https urls in PHP  4.0.2 and newer.  Just look for --with-curl in your phpinfo() output, and if it's there, you're all set.  Go to http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.curl.php to learn how to use the CURL functions.

cheers,
Jerry

I'm rewriting my PHP/MySQL application that manages the scheduling of
court interpreters (for our office here in the federal court downtown).
It's hideous spaghetti and I want to do it over with Smarty and Pear and
OOP.

There are entities like Judge and User and Event and Interpreter that will
merit their own objects and be persisted in the database.

Suppose you have a class User. Would you give it a save() method that
writes its state to the database? And if so, do you pass this method a
Pear $db object as argument, or does it already possess its own $db object
(which perhaps you handed it at instantiation time)?

... OR ...

Would you have write a separate DB class -- one that extends the Pear DB
perhaps -- with methods like saveXXX() for each of your classes?

I hope this is clear. These may seem naive questions to you old pros. I'm
one of those self-taught lightweight dudes and I'd love to get it more
nearly right this time around. Thanks.

If you wanted to do it with classes, you could have some options for 
the saving.

The user could have a save method, that would either look like 
$user->save($dbsae); and that would save to the database, or you could 
not have a link identifier and just do $user->save(); - or you could 
have it write to the database every time it does anything, but that 
would be kinda useless. If you were going to have it the most "robust" 
code then I would say have a save method, and send it the dbase link 
identifier.

If you wanted to have the database a class, you just send it the 
database class variable, say $SQLdb, and inside the save(); method, do 
something like
$saveresult = $SQLdb->Query($savequery);
so that you can have your own error checking/etc..

VBulletin (www.vbulletin.com) uses a database class variable to do 
queries and everything so if you get a chance to look at the source, 
that would probabally be most helpful.

Good luck!

Recently ran across innoDB for mySQL...looks to be pretty powerful and
claims to benchmark faster than MyISAM tables - anyone have any experience
with this and can educate me on the advantages, disadvantages?

Message-ID: <v04011727bb3404c96b9b@[65.176.48.27]>

I'm passing form data from one page to another.

On the first page I

	session_start();
	session_destroy();
	session_unset();

	session_unregister('MyVAR');
	session_register('MyVAR');

To initialize my variables.

The input type for MyVAR is a checkbox.  The problem is that it seems to
"stick'.  Even though I run a javascript routine onSubmit to set and test
the value of the MyVAR on the subsequent page I get the "on" value.

On the second page I

	session_register('MyVAR');
	extract($_POST);

and set a cookie.

Then I test for the value of $MyVAR and

	print "<input type=hidden name=MyVAR value=\"$MyVAR\"> $MyVAR";

and the result is as if the checkbox were checked -- even when it's not.

This is making me crazy.

Suggestions?

Clyde

Not sure of the context of the question but here's my 2 cents...

By showing us these different arrays, I will assume you want to use
the arrays as reference points to the variable names stored as elements.
We could have some fun with this...
--------------------------------
$hasSelectedLetter = 'this letter';
$letter = 'not that but this letter!';

print $x = $arrayListArray[0];
print $x = eval("return \$$x"."[0];");
print $$x; 

print $y = $arrayListArray[3];
print $y = eval("return \$$y"."[1];");
print $$y;

Output:
booleanNonFormVars
hasSelectedLetter
this letter
profileNonFormVarArray
letter
not that but this letter!
-----------------------------------
I wish there was something syntactically correct yet intuitive to allow 
us to use something like:
$hasSelectedLetter value ~~  $$($$($$arrayListArray[0])[0])
$letter 		 value ~~  $$($$($$arrayListArray[3])[0])
Looks very PERLsh, iick.  Oh well, the PHP parser would choke on this
instantly.

Hope this turns on a light bulb or two.

Yeah; I did something similar to this for auditing - I had an Expose method that would return a neat array of sorts that I could then save to file, db etc.

I typically have each class or base class make a db connection in the constructor.  I've found it convienent for the class to expect a named db link in the global space and use that.  If it doesn't find it, it'll do some predictable action, ie fail or create it.

Ehh, that feels clunky IMHO.

Sorry, it's the best I could do

I've looked at using innoDB several times, but always fell back to MyISAM.  I guess the biggest advantage would be considered transactions (so MySQL does have transactions!) and foreign key constraints.

IIRC, the reason performance can be seen as better than MyISAM is because of locking - innoDB does row locking and MyISAM does table locking.  Both I suppose have some pros and cons.  That said, I commonly hear that major MySQL implementations use innoDB.

With modern versions of PHP, just use the $_SESSION array directly.

page1.php

session_start();
$_SESSION['MyVAR'] = 'Hans';


page2.php

session_start();
echo $_SESSION['MyVAR'];

Hmm, not too sure.  Double check that the javascript isn't doing anything wacky, because a hidden input can't be checked.

IN that case, Eddy, how about this, THIS works:

$booleanNonFormVars = array('hasSelectedLetter', 'hasEnteredProfile', 'hasSelectedProfile',
                             'hasEditedProfile', 'hasDeletedProfile', 'willDeleteProfile',

 $profileNonFormVarArray = array('profileName', 'letter', 'name');

 // COMPACT ARRAYS INTO 2-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY arrayListArray
 $arrayListArray = compact('booleanNonFormVars', 'booleanVars', 'profileVarArray', 
                        'profileNonFormVarArray');

 // I COULD NOT POSSIBLY EVER EXPLAIN THIS.. ASK HANS ZAUNERE OF NY PHP TO EXPLAIN IT FOR YOU
 foreach ($arrayListArray as $key => $val) {
  for ($j = 0; $j < sizeOf($val); $j++) {

I didn't think of using compact() ... cool function!!
----------------------------------------
Use compact() on ALL your arrays and you can do this:
 
print $arrayListArray['booleanNonFormVars']['hasSelectedLetter'];
print $arrayListArray['profileNonFormVarArray']['letter'];

not sure if that's what you really want, but it's as clean as you're going
to get.
 
Huh? I didn't try but this can't possibly be valid PHP: ${$val[$j]} = 0;

Not the prettiest, easily fooled and generally ugly... but it seems to work for now:


function getuflatest() {
   $ufpage = implode('',file('http://www.userfriendly.org'));
   $latestpos = strpos($ufpage,'Latest Strip');
   $uforgpos = strpos($ufpage,'http://www.userfriendly.org/',$latestpos);
   $gifpos = strpos($ufpage,'.gif"',$uforgpos);
   $uflatest = substr($ufpage,$uforgpos,$gifpos-$uforgpos+4);

   return $uflatest;
}

im still trying to understand the rift on why mysql was unbundled for it but
im finding sqlite to be a pretty cool nifty little app ...

it has claims of being up to 2x faster than mysql for common procedures ...

I haven't used php5 yet (other than to say "yup, I got it complied and 
running") so I'd love to hear you comments on it as you play with it 
more.

> im still trying to understand the rift on why mysql was unbundled for

No "rift" per se. MySQL has changed it's license for the 4.x and 5.x 
code bases. As such it is no longer compatible with PHP license. Hence 
it is no longer included.

MySQL was the fastest kid on the block, when it did a whole lot less 
than what it does today. Not advocating, just remember the MySQL vs 
Postgres wars of old (well... and still current day :)

Hans,

You know that I believe that regex's save the world :)
Here's a little something from me:

function getLatestCartoon() {
	preg_match("~ALT=\"?Latest Strip\"?.*SRC=\"?([^\"]+)\"?~i",
file_get_contents('http://www.userfriendly.org/'), $arr);
	return $arr[1];
}

echo getLatestCartoon();

well im really waiting for php5 more for cli stuff but what's is (or seems)
more confusing is that you have mysqli stuff ...
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysqli.php

which primarily states that the functions are meant for mysql 4.1+ which
means eventually when u do upgrade ur mysql packages that u would need to
recode according to this new api or would it become dissolved altogether
since php+mysql is no more ... is it kinda like code w/ mysql @ ur own risk
since its extension is built in, then vice versa, then have a new api.

it does not really matter to me @ the moment, its just a general question
about the php language.

Message-ID: <DEA07A6E-B5AB-11D7-B5F2-003065569500@xylophage.com>

Hi guys,

This may be in danger of going OT, but I'm looking for a possible PHP 
solution to a frustration I run across when developing in Flash. 
Without going into a long and drawn out tirade about the shortcomings 
of Flash's testing environment, what I'm looking for is a more 
authentic simulation of making an HTTP request to the server. And of 
course, what better way to do this than on my local apache server? Of 
course, in order to properly test preloaders and whatnot I need to 
simulate a slow connection, like 56k dialup, for instance.

So, is there a way to use PHP to slow down the execution of a specific 
page on my local machine? For those of you familiar with Flash, I am 
aware of Flash's capability of doing this, but the testing environment 
does not support bandwidth simulation for externally loaded movies, 
which is why I'm looking for a different solution.

I'm running Apache 1.3.26 and PHP 4.2.3 on Jaguar (Mac OS 10.2.6)

Thanks in advance for any advice,
Winston

I don't have any experience with the following, but I remembered reading
about it. Perhaps you can confibure your server to simulate a slow
connection.

Yeah, that is a good mod to install :D It does say that you can throttle
the bandwidth down to say 10kb/second, or 5kb/second, to simulate dial-up.
I have jaguar 10.2.6 also, and It would be nice to throttle my bandwidth
down so that people dont kill my internet connection while im on
battle.net... :)

	object
Message-ID: <v04011709bb38bdc8d1f9@[65.176.48.195]>

I'm trying to determine whether the user is coming to a given page (call it
pageB.php) from the previous page in the sequence (pageA.php) or off-site.

While I can access window.history.length,  i cannot  access a given key in
that array:

"Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to get property
History.previous"

or

"Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to call method History.item"

FWIW I'm using php and  while I can determine the
$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] this technique is not infallible.  Apparently
when you hit "back" (or select from the "Go" menu) some browsers use the
cached version of page -- which means they return  pageA.php and not
pageX.html

Aaaaarrrrgggghhhh!!!!!

Suggestions?

Will the previous page have any form elements? If so, within a form within pageA.php you can have this:

<input type=hidden name=refURL value=<?= $PHP_SELF ?>>

Calling this form variable in pageB.php would ensure that they came from pageA.php

You can also do this in a query string, however, a better solution would be some kind of unique key, such as

pageB.php?var1=blah&var2=foo&...&uniqueKey=ICameFromPageA.php&...

That way you look for some unique string that could only have come from pageA.php.

Message-ID: <MDEOLIKGBCNEAAMMDHHOCEPMFOAB.mike@dbeat.com>


Hello, NYPHP-TALK,

   I'm looking for a *SMART* & experienced person to help out
with a summer/fall work over-load here in NYC.  

   This would be 3-6 months of FULL TIME work 
(40-50+ hrs/wk) paid on a contract basis starting ASAP.

   At the end of that time, it MAY transition to a full 
time job. (Depends on business factors + right person.)

  Work consists of PHP/Postgres, projects include:

   - integrating role-based secured access to existing
     web-based system, with new tools to administer
     users, permissions, etc.

   - lots and lots of QA / repairs. 

   - enhancements to web-based CRM tools

   - relatively complicated reports (eg: must grasp
      business side of things.)

  Great opportunity in fast-paced shop for the right 
person who can COMMIT for the next 3-6 months.   

  Interested?  Email phone number/resume to mbiamonte at affinitysolutions.com

Thanks

- Mike Biamonte

I can't improve on Phil's solution options, but I did want to comment that
the JavaScript history object is locked for security reasons... imagine if
any site you visited could see everywhere you've been on the web since you
started up your browser, and log that information.  It would be a huge
privacy breech.  So they locked it up, and will let you move the user
forwards and back, but not actually see where they've been.  As they say,
it's not a bug, it's a feature! :-)

Will the previous page have any form elements? If so, within a form within
pageA.php you can have this:
 
<input type=hidden name=refURL value=<?= $PHP_SELF ?>>
 
Calling this form variable in pageB.php would ensure that they came from
pageA.php
 
You can also do this in a query string, however, a better solution would be
some kind of unique key, such as
 
pageB.php?var1=blah&var2=foo&...&uniqueKey=ICameFromPageA.php&...
 
That way you look for some unique string that could only have come from
pageA.php.

I'm trying to determine whether the user is coming to a given page (call it
pageB.php) from the previous page in the sequence (pageA.php) or off-site. 

While I can access window.history.length, i cannot access a given key in
that array:

"Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to get property
History.previous" 

or 

"Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to call method History.item"

FWIW I'm using php and while I can determine the $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']
this technique is not infallible. Apparently when you hit "back" (or select
from the "Go" menu) some browsers use the cached version of page -- which
means they return pageA.php and not pageX.html

Aaaaarrrrgggghhhh!!!!!

Suggestions?

Yes, I'm passing form data from page to page and then to a third party
off-site.

Except I'm not sure this will address the cache-ing problem. But5 you have
given me something to think about.

Hmmm.  The O'Reilly BlueJay book mentions URL rewriting but I didn't see
any examples.  Cam you point me to any resources? And just to complicate
matters I'm also frames
 
Thanks for your help.

I've been using CLI PHP for over a year and it's worked essentially flawless; especially since 4.3.x, CLI has really come together.

Unless I'm misunderstanding, I've been hearing a lot of concern regarding the decoupling of php and mysql.  While the MySQL client libs have been bundled, it's always been recommended to link against the "real" clients libs from MySQL, especially for critical systems.  There are a number of reasons for this, but IMHO the unbundling of MySQL is actually a good thing, in the true sense of making php lighterweight and moving extensions to PECL.  Quite honestly, I'm not very hot on bundling sql-lite, though.

mysqli is also a good thing, when it matures.  It'll enable many of the features and flexibility only found in those "other guy's" DBs.  After working with OCI8, and taking into account some of the major additions to MySQL in the near future, mysqli will become a nessecity, and a benefit.

Something else you may also look at is using some of the available firewalling tools, which essentially drops packets on purpose.  Although I don't know exactly what's available under Jaguar, under FreeBSD there's dummynet (I think other's, but they escape me at the moment) and Linux has a flavor-of-the-month solution *duck*  :)

If you need to do this for security/integrity reasons, you'll need to do it server-side.  I've used one-time keys with success, either via a cookie, POST or GET.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Echoes in Javascript
Message-ID: <004e01c34aeb$fe4f3680$8b00a8c0@timmerslaptop>

I have a simple javascript preloader script that I want to use to show the progress of an image upload on a page, and the script looks like it would work perfectly. You do your image defines in the javascript and this is where I run into a problem. I haven't tested this or tried it but I was wondering if you can have an image upload form that would then point to the page where the preloader javascript is....and somehow show the preloading status bar as the image is being uploaded.

I would have to execute php within the preloader script somehow to echo out the name of the image being uploaded and I just wasn't sure if this would work or not. Kinkos has an uploader application on their site that shows the status of the upload and I am trying to achieve something similiar to that.

Any help is appreciated!

I just happen to glance over the PHP Classes mailing this morning and 
noticed this.  It may be what you're looking for:

Look at the code that allows phpmyadmin to do this - it works very nicely,
and should be somewhat well ironed out.

Just a point of clarification here.

Excel exports CSV files "Comma Separated Variables"

Not CVS "Concurrent Versions System".

Sorry for being a nit-picker on this but the phpclasses actually support
both.

Message-ID: <31051.204.69.151.229.1058366781.squirrel@www.war3.com>

I've been having this problem forever on my browser. I am using Win2k with
IE 6.0 at work. When I log into a NT domain authenticated page (say
phpmyadmin) - forms do not submit correctly through the remainder of my
page. Even if it is a different site, my forms do not pass the variables.

I have a page for a conference room scheduling program that dis-allows
anonymous access, so that you can hit the page, and it will log you in
automatically, since the login cookie expires on closing the browser. It
logs in fine, and redirects you to the index page with the correct
cookies.

I can then click on say, list a calendar.

Then it displays all calendars that I have access to, and have buttons to
submit forms to view them. When you click on them, you hit the same page,
since that is what shows if no options of the form are submitted.

All of my form headers are <form name="form1" method="post"
action="blahblah.php"> as an example. Why are the variables not passing
with IIS 5 NT Authentication turned on? Any help will be appreciated :)

Perhaps the scripts are coded to directly access variables, such as $foo,
rather than $_POST['foo'] in expectation of register_globals being on?

Say you click this form:

<form name="form1" method="post" action="admin.editcal.php">
<input type="hidden" name="method" value="edit">
<input type="hidden" name="calid" value="12">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Edit Calendar 12">
</form>

And in the top of the admin.editcal.php

if (empty($_POST['method']))
  $method = "index";
else
  $method = $_POST['method'];

switch ($method)
{
  case "index":
    // display code to show the list of calendars to edit
    break;
  case "edit":
    // edits 1 calendar
    break;
  case "save":
    // saves the calendar
    break;
}

and it goes to the index page when i click the forms.

i changed it to accept not just the $_POST['method'] variable, but also
$method, and then had a link saying <a
href="admin.editcal.php?method=edit&calid=12">Edit Calendar 12</a> and it
would go into the edit form, but the form would not submit.

All of the origional code works right, if you do not go to an
authenticated page through IIS (right-click on page, properties, directory
access, edit, disallow anonymous, integrate NT authentication)

stupid me, I think I accidentally sent this to an individual instead of
to the list, it went something like this:

Could somebody please correct me if I'm wrong about the proper steps to
take to upgrade my MySQL from 3.32.56 to 4.0.13 on my RedHat 9 development
box. I should note that I have Apache 1.3.27 with PHP 4.3.2 as a DSO.

1) shut down mysql and httpd

2) I have Mysql client and server installed as RedHat RPMs. Remove these
with rpm --erase ... after backing up data.

3) install MySQL according to
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Installing_binary.html including
post-installation setup

4) rebuild PHP with ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
--with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql
[--with-other-stuff etc]

followed by make; make install

5) my httpd.conf has been working fine; leave it alone

6) restart httpd and mysql

7) crack open a beer

Right?

Gratefully,

I always install php into /usr/local/php which can be handy if you have 
multiple installs (for instance, I have distinct DSO and CLI compiles) but this 
is of course just a preferance.  I also like to use the php.ini-recommended 
file, so:  cp PHPSRC/php.ini-
recommended /where/you/installed/to/php/lib/php.ini  (or something like that)

Yes, #7 is vital.  Something else you may want to consider:  since it's 
a "considerable" upgrade from MySQL 3.x to 4.x, I'm always most comfortable 
rebuilding the databases/tables in 4.x (especially if they aren't that big).  
This may just be paranoia, but at a minimum you'll get slightly optimized 
tables.  There are a couple ways of doing this; here's one that I liked:

mysqldump -u 'theuser' -p 'thepassword' --quick --allow-keywords -h thehost.com 
db1 table1 | mysql -u 'root' -p 'passwd' --database=db1new

There are of course variations on the theme, from doing multiple DBs, to 
tables, users, etc.

Hi All;

Does anyone know of a date validation routine for php?

I have a form with users submitting a date and I want to be sure they put in
a valid date.

Thanks

You can save them the trouble by creating a date variable in your form 
processing script:

$date=date("d-m-Y");

Then there isn't a need to have a field in the form requesting the user 
to enter the date.

I assume you are trying to check the number of days in the month so you don't end up with 2-31-2003.  It depends on how you are collecting the information.  If you are having them fill in three different fields you could try something like this...

if($_POST['day'] > date('t', mktime(0,0,0,$_POST['month'],1,$_POST['year'])) {
   // Too many days
}

Thanks Hans for your unfailing helpfulness (perhaps combined with a
self-interested quest for entertainment to ease the boredom of your
training course (-: ?)

I can feel my heart rate picking up, that surely means I'm gonna do it.

i've used getimagesize(), which will give you an array with one of the array

$fileparts = explode(".",$filename);
$extention = $fileparts[sizeof($fileparts)-1];

that will give you the extention of the file, if the $filename var is

In late versions of PHP there's http://us2.php.net/mime_magic  which may be handy (although finiky at times).


Also, offtopic, phpclasses has been a hot item today:  don't forget the NYPHP mirror:  http://mirrors.nyphp.org/

I completed a day of IIS training so I should be an expert (the instructor said that we'll learn in this 3 day course what it'd take a college course to teach for Apache - I'm not so sure yet  :)

Anywhooo, for testing, what if you set the form's method to GET ?  Any differance?  Using the latest version of PHP?  As ISAPI or CGI?

Just some food for thought; maybe I'll get back to you in another couple of days :)

ISAPI dll's, get variables work, but the problem is that they arent 
hidden..

one thing i noticed is that if the directory disallows anonymous access 
along with the one file, it works, but you cant have anonymous and 
restricted access int he same browser "session" it seems....


i wonder why they dont say anything about that anywhere on php.net...

I honestly don't know if this is expected behavior of IIS, or a bug of PHP.  Does a CGI version have the same issues?  Maybe http://bugs.php.net has something, too.

This process is completely insecure.  I can put up anything as long as I 
give it an acceptable extension.

As mentioned by others earlier, use getimagesize().  Here's some code from 
a project of mine:

    if ( !$Info = getimagesize($_FILES['Photo']['tmp_name']) ) {
        $Prob[] = 'File isn\'t an image';
    }

    if ($Info[2] != 2) {
        $Prob[] = 'Image is not in JPEG format';
    }


DON'T use this, becasuse submissions from AOL users choke due to their
browser not sending a proper mime type, if one at all:

    if ($_FILES['Photo']['type'] != 'image/jpeg') {
        $Prob[] = 'File is not in JPEG format';
    }

I use

$_FILES['nameOfFileFieldInForm']['type']

I think this reads the info out of the file's header.

AOL doesn't send a MIME type?!?

I've been using this in my upload class for quite some time now without
much (any?) issue:

	switch ($_FILES[$this->field_name]["type"]) {
		case 'application/octet-stream':
		default:
			// Unfamiliar extension (includes fla) must find
extension otherwise
			$file_array = explode('.', $this->file_name);
			$this->extension = end($file_array); 
			break; 
			
		case 'application/x-shockwave-flash'; 
			$this->extension = 'swf'; 
			break;
			
		case 'application/postscript';
			// Should be ai ps or eps
			$file_array = explode('.', $this->file_name);
			$this->extension = $file_array[1]; 
			break;
			
		case 'application/pdf';
			$this->extension = 'pdf'; 
			break;
			
		case 'audio/mpeg'; 
			$this->extension = 'mp3'; 
			break;
			
		case 'audio/x-ms-wma';

			$this->extension = 'wav'; 
			break;
			
		case 'image/gif':
			$this->extension = 'gif'; 
			break;
			
		case 'image/jpeg':
		case 'image/pjpeg':

I have been looking around for a way to get browsers to download rather than

seems to be ignored in favor of the file's actual extension.  Yes, I could
zip the file, but would rather avoid that as well, since my customers will

Any ideas of how to structure a link to fool the browser into starting a

Have you looked into the Content-Disposition header? With it you can specify a
filename (convenient when the name of your PHP script isn't the name you want
the browser to use), and you can indicate inline or attachment. You would want
attachment.

Double-check my syntax, but I think it would go something like this:

header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=blah.gif');

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <HPEDLHFCBCJOAJDODGKMIEJHCCAA.rudy@taytek.com>

I need to collect sensitive information on one of my web pages.  I have
established a secure session https:// utilizing my hosting service's
certificate.  Now that the session is secure I need to be sure the collected
data is secure.  While I could encrypt the data before storing it in the
MySQL database, I need to be able to decrypt it eventually to process the
orders.  I've used MD5 hash function to encrypt passwords I store in cookies
but that approach would not work here.  I need to hold the key locally,
meaning on a machine outside the web-server that will be able to decrypt the
information after retrieving it.

I like the idea that the database only stores encrypted data that way should
the database be compromised the information stored there will be of little
value.

I am very unsure about any security techniques that work best in this
situation and just pointing me in the right directions would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Rudy

This is a BAD idea for security.  This permits hijacking through someone
sneaking time at the person's computer, a cross-site scripting
vulnerability or exploitation of browser bugs.

I believe there is a known bug in IE that, when using https, it has
difficulty resolving objects (images, links) if they use relative paths
so a user can sometimes see a message that says there are secure and
insecure items on a page. The workaround, as I understand it, is to use
a full path to the object(s). The question is, then, whether the path
should be something like "/index.php" or does IE prefer
"https://mydomain.com/index.php" ?

P.S. Unfortunately I can't locate the MS Knowledgebase article dealing

An idea is about all I have. :-) Something like this I think:

<cfheader name="Content-Disposition" value="attachment; filename=blah.gif">

Chris/Jerry,

Thank you both for your suggestions.  Using headers is definitely the way to
go.  After some playing around and reading up on compatibility issues, here
is what I am working with so far:

<?php

header("Pragma: public");
header('Cache-Control: public');
header("Content-type: 'application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Length: ".filesize($FILE_PATH.$file));
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$file");
//echo "\\n";
readfile($FILE_PATH.$file);

?>

The Pragma and cache-control seem to be needed by IE6 in order to work.  the
content type "image/gif" gave me some issues where the file was downloaded
but corrupted.  This stuff is completely ignored (broken) by IE on a
Macintosh, It will always just display the file. 

Thanks a lot for your help.

Mike

Mike,
Change 
    header("Content-type: 'application/octet-stream");
to
    header('Content-type: application/force-download');
It should fix the Mac problem.  However IE on Mac seems to totally ignore the Content-disposition header and will prompt to save as a .php file.

Jerry,

"force-download" seems to work fine on the PC.  The Mac is still just
displaying the image inline.

Thanks for your help.

as a solution to a similar problem, we used a combination of a Files
directive and $PATH_INFO -

the php script would be, for ex site.com/download (no extension) with a
Files directive like this in .htaccess:

<Files download>
        ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Files>

Then, you pass it the desired image filename like this:

site.com/download/gifname.gif

the string gifname.gif would end up in var $PATH_INFO in the script named
download

then, you can fetch the file, etc etc, and push out the headers you want, as
described previously, by others.

you -could- do this with a script named something.gif, with the same Files
directive, but you'd lose the ability to set the proper name for the file.

I think this trick still works even when the URL is something like:

http://site.com/download.php/gifname.gif

This would save having to use the ForceType directive.

Another trick I have seen used (though I do not know how effective it is) is a
URL like this:

http://site.com/download.php?iesucks=gifname.gif

I've never had to work around this particular problem, but those are the
methods I have seen mentioned when this topic arises.

Hope that helps.

Chris

  I need to collect sensitive information on one of my web pages.  I have established a secure session https:// utilizing my hosting service's certificate.  Now that the session is secure I need to be sure the collected data is secure.  While I could encrypt the data before storing it in the MySQL database, I need to be able to decrypt it eventually to process the orders.  I've used MD5 hash function to encrypt passwords I store in cookies but that approach would not work here.  I need to hold the key locally, meaning on a machine outside the web-server that will be able to decrypt the information after retrieving it. 

  I like the idea that the database only stores encrypted data that way should the database be compromised the information stored there will be of little value.  

  I am very unsure about any security techniques that work best in this situation and just pointing me in the right directions would be greatly appreciated.  

  Thanks,

I have no idea whether this is the correct solution, but is the only one I've been able to find in the wide world of browsers.  I had to hack https:// into a bunch of CF code (only for images, however) at one point, because of this.

Technically, MD5 isn't encryption - it's a one way digest, ie, you can't determine the original data from the digest.  And as Dan pointed out, easily hijacked (but you're using SSL, so it's much better, but still suseptible to cookie browsing if someone has local machine access).

MySQL 4.x series supports some things that may help:

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Miscellaneous_functions.html  (search for variations of 'encrypt')
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Secure_connections.html


But keep in mind; if the server on which the key resides is compromised, the game's over.  Encryption like this is a vicious circle; just be sure your server isn't cracked :)

At the time the problem arose, the quick fix was to remove this check, 
since the more accurate file type check was there also.

Thanks for prodding me to poke around a bit more.  I put in a debug step
and asked the user with the problem to tell me what comes up.  Turns out
AOL is sending "image/pjpeg" as the MIME for .jpg files.

Enjoy,

Ah .. Wasn't actaully poking, more surprise than anything.  

I've found that IE (5+?) also seems to use the same header (image/pjpeg)
as well.

Nonetheless, glad you found it.

Hmm...  This got me to thinking.  It'd be nice to have GPG built into PHP 
to avoid use of program execution functions.  In the mean time, 
proc_open() is handy.

With GPG and PGP, you can encrypt stuff with a public key then decrypt it 
with the private key.  The private key is password protected, but the 
public key isn't.  So, an automated process can encrypt the stuff on the 
way in.  To get stuff out, submit the password via a secure form.

While this isn't the right process for all situations, it can be useful.

Enjoy,

 Subject: Apache HTTP Server 1.3.28 Released
      To: announce at httpd.apache.org


                    Apache HTTP Server 1.3.28 Released

    The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
    pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.28 of the Apache HTTP
    Server ("Apache").  This Announcement notes the significant changes
    in 1.3.28 as compared to 1.3.27. The Announcement is also available
    in German from http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement.txt.de.

    This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release.
    A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this 
document.
    A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.  Of
    particular note is that 1.3.28 addresses and fixes 3 potential
    security issues:

     o CAN-2003-0460 (cve.mitre.org): Fix the rotatelogs support program 
on
       Win32 and OS/2 to ignore special control characters received over 
the
       pipe.  Previously such characters could cause it to quit logging 
and
       exit.  We would like to thank the Hitachi Incident Response team 
for
       their responsible disclosure of this issue.

     o VU#379828 : The server could crash when going into an infinite 
loop
       due to too many subsequent internal redirects and nested 
subrequests.

     o Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child processes, 
such
       as CGI scripts.

    We consider Apache 1.3.28 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 
available
    and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
    the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
    releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

    Apache 1.3.28 is available for download from

        http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
                 - or -
        http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/

    Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
    of changes.

    Binary distributions are available from

        http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/

    The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
    mirrors listed at

        http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

    As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
    modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
    full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
    included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
    files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
    distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
    distributions for specific platforms are not always available. Win32
    binary distributions are based on the Microsoft Installer (.MSI)
    technology.  While development continues to make this installation 
method
    more robust, questions should be directed to the
    news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.

    For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

    In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
    version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
    range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
    fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPE threaded
    platforms.

    Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over 
half
    of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
    variants.

    IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix 
OS
    variants.  While  the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, 
Netware
    or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
    these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
    non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
    software's Unix origin.

    Apache 2.0 has been structured for multiple operating systems from 
its
    inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM 
modules.
    Users on non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to
    Apache 2.0 for better performance, stability and security on their
    platforms.

                      Apache 1.3.28 Major changes

   Security vulnerabilities

      * CAN-2003-0460 (cve.mitre.org): Fix the rotatelogs support 
program on
        Win32 and OS/2 to ignore special control characters received 
over the
        pipe.  Previously such characters could cause it to quit logging 
and
        exit.  We would like to thank the Hitachi Incident Response team 
for
        their responsible disclosure of this issue.

      * VU#379828 : The server could crash when going into an infinite 
loop
        due to too many subsequent internal redirects and nested 
subrequests.

      * Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child processes, 
such
        as CGI scripts.

   New features

    The main new features in 1.3.28 (compared to 1.3.27) are:

      * Added new ap_register_cleanup_ex() API function which allows
        for a "magic" cleanup function to be run at register time
        rather than at cleanup time.

      * Improvements to mod_usertrack that allows for a regular (verbose)
        as well as "compact" version of the tracking cookie (the new
        'CookieFormat' directive), and the ability to prepend a string
        to the cookie via the 'CookiePrefix' directive.

    New features that relate to specific platforms:

      * Introduce Win32 .pdb diagnostic symbols into the Apache 1.3 build
        (as created in Apache 2.0.45 and later.)  which makes debugging 
and
        analysis of crash dumps and Dr. Watson logs trivial.

      * AIX: Change the default accept mutex mechanism from pthread back 
to
        fcntl.

   Bugs fixed

    The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.27 (or 
earlier)
    and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.28:

      * Make sure the accept mutex is released before calling child exit
        hooks and cleanups.

      * Fix mod_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs.  The escaping 
routines
        now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
        appended if supported by the particular scheme.

      * Prevent obscenely large values of precision in ap_vformatter
        from clobbering a buffer.

      * Update timeout algorithm in free_proc_chain. If a subprocess
        did not exit immediately, the thread would sleep for 3 seconds
        before checking the subprocess exit status again. In a very
        common case when the subprocess was an HTTP server CGI script,
        the CGI script actually exited a fraction of a second into the 3
        second sleep, which effectively limited the server to serving one
        CGI request every 3 seconds across a persistent connection.

Do you guys use URL rewriting to ensure that the session id is propagated
from page to page even if the user refuses your cookie?

I've read somewhere that it can cause 'confusion' or 'problems' if the
user bookmarks a URL with a session id in the query string, and tries to
access the page after the session is over, but those readings did not say
whether you should really worry about it or what the worst case scenario
is.

I've been to sites that say "you must accept a cookie..." but that seems
kind of authoritarian, not to mention geeky (-:

If you are POSTing, you can stash the session id in a hidden field, which
would seem to solve the issue, but you what about when you GET.

MD5 is a one-way hash suitable for passwords. Above is a decent encryption
approach for when you must encrypt and decrypt the stored value. Hope this
helps.

Technically, MD5 isn't encryption - it's a one way digest, ie, you can't
determine the original data from the digest.  And as Dan pointed out, easily
hijacked (but you're using SSL, so it's much better, but still suseptible to
cookie browsing if someone has local machine access).

MySQL 4.x series supports some things that may help:

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Miscellaneous_functions.html  (search for
variations of 'encrypt') http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Secure_connections.html


But keep in mind; if the server on which the key resides is compromised, the
game's over.  Encryption like this is a vicious circle; just be sure your
server isn't cracked :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] sorting multi-dimesional arrays ...
Message-ID: <000501c34fea$e9744a80$6500a8c0@THINKPAD>

ok, not the greatest code in the world but it did what i needed :-) ...

basically i have around 3500+ access points logged and wanted to do some
stats, but could not think of a better way to sort via a 2d array on the 2nd
element, im just looking to shorten up the code (by just using an array
method of some kind - array_multisort?)...

example output:

Indexing 3388 access points ...
SSID: "linksys" : 620 (18.30%)
SSID: "default" : 192 (5.67%)
SSID: "Wireless" : 167 (4.93%)
SSID: "wireless" : 58 (1.71%)
SSID: "WLAN" : 44 (1.30%)
SSID: "Verizon Wi-Fi" : 43 (1.27%)

Something else you may also look at is using some of the available firewalling tools, which essentially drops packets on purpose. Although I don't know exactly what's available under Jaguar, under FreeBSD there's dummynet (I think other's, but they escape me at the moment) and Linux has a flavor-of-the-month solution *duck* :)

Message-ID: <20030722.074218.490.150402@webmail15.lax.untd.com>


I haven't had to do any complex sorting on the second element but when I do I use usort().  Something like this...

usort(two_d_array, 'second_element_sort');

function second_element_sort($a, $b) {
   if($a[0] == $b[0]) return 0;
   return ($a[0] > $b[0]) ? -1 : 1;
}

The arguments passed to second_element_sort are two_d_array[n] and two_d_array[n+1].

the functon array_count_values was actually what i was looking for, but in
the test below the key values are not retained ... im still trying to figure
it out ...

$a = array("Cisco","Cisco","Intel","Apple", "Apple", "Apple", "Speedstream",
"Apple");
$b = array_count_values ($a);
 print_r($b);
 rsort($b);
 print_r($b);

Hi All;

Is there a way to store the entire output os a php page to be emailed later?

I was thinkingsomething like:

op_start("showOPA.php");
$blah=op_get_content();
echo $blah;


but it's not doing anything.  Is there another function I should be using?

thanks

willie

I'm doing a small e-commerce site, and was thinking about setting up a

object bufferingI may be wrong, but doesn't ob_start either just turn on
output buffering, or takes a callback function as a paramater.  So instead
maybe:

ob_start();
include('showOPA.php');
$blah=ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();
echo $blah;

Maybe?  Not sure of the include, you may need to print the contents of the
file...but I think this should work.

Sure.

The functions are ob_start() and ob_get_content(). Note the ob (for output
buffering) rather than op.

Also, to start buffering, just do this:

ob_start();

I'm guessing you just meant to include showOPA.php or something. Otherwise,
your example will work up to the point where the output is stored in $blah. You
can then write that to a file, email it, or whatever.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Sorry about the op typos.

Yes that works great using the include.  I've been staring at this for hours
and the answer is so simple.

Thank to all

If you're going to rollout your own ... You should make sure to read the
Paypal-IPN manual also .. Which will help you to understand the
processes involved in verifying the orders

I'm blindly jumping into a thread here, but perhaps http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.arsort.php  ?

Otherwise, play with array_multisort(); specifying the various array levels as arguments.

Although probably not very popular, if I need sessions I use cookies.  If I detect the user doesn't have cookies enabled, I present a pleasant notice saying so :)

Sure, this could happen; the impact on your site's data is dependant on the backend logic, though.  If someone bookmarks, or send a URL to a friend, they are effectively using the same session.

the names/ssids are not unique in that it pertains to its mac address ...
another method was

"select count(ssid) where ssid = 'linksys'" looping through the names,
stuffing it into an array and then sorting.

the question still remains how to perform array_count_values, sort it, and
still be able to retain original key values (as they get indexed instead),
seems 2 arrays must be used ...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XSLT extension (compiling and installing PHP 4)
In-Reply-To: <001901c351f8$92668f40$6400a8c0@THINKPAD>
Message-ID: <D3987512-BDE0-11D7-A46D-00039344DCA8@nyu.edu>

Hi,

Wondering if anyone on here has compiled and installed PHP with the 
XSLT extensions. I know the process involves installing Expat and 
Sablotron and then compiling PHP with  "--enable-xslt 
--with-xslt-sablot"

The compiling works fine for me. But at "make" I get an error

/usr/local/lib/libsablot.so: undefined reference to `operator 
new[](unsigned)'
/usr/local/lib/libsablot.so: undefined reference to `vtable for 
__cxxabiv1::__si_class_type_info'
/usr/local/lib/libsablot.so: undefined reference to `operator 
delete(void*)'
/usr/local/lib/libsablot.so: undefined reference to 
`__gxx_personality_v0'
/usr/local/lib/libsablot.so: undefined reference to `__cxa_pure_virtual'

/usr/local/lib/libsablot.so: undefined reference to `operator 
new(unsigned)'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [sapi/cli/php] Error 1


This is my first time compiling and installing PHP from source. I 
always used packages before. Not sure if my problem is in the Expat 
install, Sablotron install but they seemed to go ok.

There is a paragraph on php.net that says

"Make sure you have the same libraries linked to the Sablotron library 
as those, which are linked with PHP. The configuration options: 
--with-expat-dir=DIR --with-iconv-dir=DIR are there to help you specify 
them."

But I wasn't sure what to do with that.

I am running:
Red Hat 8
Apache 1.3.28
Expat 1.94
Sablotron 1.0

Compiling and installing:
php 4.3.2

Thanks for any help,

Matt

the second part of the "From" in the header has the correct email

solution) that:
	a. magic_quotes is on (yes...I'm aware of the problems it
causes).
	b. the headers (along with the message body) get "bundled" into
an array, then get serialized and sent to another function which shoots
out the email.

I believe this will always happen with the code you list, if there's an
apostrophe in the company name. Before assigning a value to $companyName
you might try parsing the string: either stripping apostrophes or by
marking them as literal text.

"Inc.", or is that the question? :-)

Someone suggested the possibility of using "addslashes" but I wouldn't
want the email header to 
say "Jay\'s Auto Wrecking." Stripping out the apostrophe leaves us with
"Jays Auto Wrecking" which isn't the company name. I thought of,
perhaps, htmlspecialchars but I'm not sure if that will introduce more
problems for if the email header has a problem with &#039; representing
an apostrophe/single quote.

How about this:

$sHeaders = "From: \"$sCompanyName\" <{$_SESSION['srDU_sLoginEMailAddr']}>\n";

Also, what are the values of $sCompanyName and
$_SESSION['srDU_sLoginEMailAddr'] exactly?

I take it this would be, in a sense, a "global" change you're
suggesting. But wouldn't the "FROM" address come out as "Jay's Auto
Wrecking" (that is, with the double quotes around it)? 

And the values are: $sCompanyName is the name of the company sending the
email, the session variable is their email address.

Looks like libsablot has some unresolved symbols.  Try running ldconfig and then do the make again.  And/or, supply the base directory where libsablot and libexpat are installed, during the ./configure of php.

This will explicitly tell gcc and friends where to find the required libs and header files.  If you installed things in the default location, trying using /usr or /usr/local

I use Nedit and I'm very happy with it specially due to the macros. That's

I've also used TextPad which is pretty good. I've tried Bluefish too. But I 
currently use Kate on Linux. I like it.

I got used to Dreamweaver, when using Windows. In any other case, I just use
vim.

I too might get some useful info from this thread  :)

Yes, Zend Studio is excellent (with a great debugger) but it's way too 
expensive for the struggling web designer with no money flow to buy. I used 
the 3 week trial and got very used to it.

Now, I'm using Homesite5 and TopStyle 3 (combination CSS editor and 
HTML/PHP editor written by the same person who originally wrote Homesite).

After doing some additional research, it seems that the problem may not
be the single quote that was botching up the header but the comma in the
company name which Sendmail had interpreted as a delimiter and therefore
it had assumed there were two different email addresses. I'm going to
"test" that route by stripping out the "comma" to see if it fixes
things.

It should, which is exactly what you want.

So when someone's name is:

Shiflett, Chris

you're going to change it to:

Shiflett Chris

That doesn't sound like a good solution. Why not just put the name in quotes
like I suggested? That's what you're supposed to do anyway, and not doing so is
probably what is confusing sendmail.

Stripping commas will work.  Also, I think Chris' suggestion of
   \"$sCompanyName\"
will work also, though you'd likely need to make sure double quotes in
$sCompanyName are stripped or escaped instead.

Hi All;

I'm trying to use mime-mail from PEAR and I not succeeding.

I get my mail but it all arrives as plain text.

I've tried attaching a file and sending it in the body of the email.

BTW I've looked at the php.pear.general newsgroup and the same problem is
over there with no solution.

the code:
<?php
require_once('Mail.php');
require_once('Mail/mime.php');
ob_start();
$orderNumber="043341-00";
$passVar="1";
include('showOPA.php');
$blah = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();
echo "Blah = $blah";
$tempFileName = tempnam('/home/httpd/html/image/temp',-data);
echo "tempFileName is $tempFileName";
$temp_fh = fopen($tempFileName,'w') or die ( "can't do it:$php_errormsg");
fputs($temp_fh,$blah);
copy($tempFileName, "/home/httpd/html/image/temp/$orderNumber.htm");
$to = 'willie at pdfsystems.com';
$headers['From'] = 'willie at pdfsystems.com';
$headers['Subject'] = 'test mime';
$mime = new Mail_mime;
$text = 'text of tests';
$mime->setTXTBody($text);
$file = '/home/httpd/html/image/temp/'.$orderNumber . '.htm';
echo "file is $file";
$mime->addAttachment($file,'text/html');
$html = $blah;
$mime->setHTMLBody($blah);
$headers = $mime->headers($headers);
$param["html_encoding"]="7bit";
$body = $mime->get($param);
$message =& Mail::factory('mail');
$message->send($to, $headers, $body);
Mail_mime::send();

?>

and I get plain text html and what looks like an encoded file as text in the
body of the email.

You don't need to encode it unless you are attaching something to

My concern is that I don't want the From address to have double-quotes
around it. Of course I can't let the emails go out with botched up
headers but I'm leaning in the direction of a solution that would clean
up these anomalies (which are a handful of cases) and leave the other
stuff alone.

In your email, the following is the From header used:

From: "Jeff" <jsiegel1 at optonline.net>

That is the format you want to achieve when you specify your own mail headers.
It really doesn't matter whether you *want* the format to be this way, because
that is not your decision. Does that make better sense now?

These aren't anomalies. Commas are fairly common within the name part of a From
header, and they don't require any special handling so long as you adhere to
the proper format as I initially suggested. The only potential problem would be
whether the name already contains a quotation mark (which is something you
should filter prior to the code in question) or some other invalid character
(\r\n would be bad, too). Along the same lines, you want to make sure the email
address is a valid email address. Assuming you have properly filtered your data
(which was my initial assumption), something as simple as this will work:

$from_header = "From: \"$name\" <$email>\r\n";

In your email, the following is the From header used:

From: "Jeff" <jsiegel1 at optonline.net>

That is the format you want to achieve when you specify your own mail
headers.
It really doesn't matter whether you *want* the format to be this way,
because
that is not your decision. Does that make better sense now?

Depends on what you're after; Nedit gives me syntax hiliting, line numbers, 
I can run the php script for debugging, I can also run the script in a 
browser if the file is on my local server (where it should be). You can 
record macros and play them via a menu (i.e. insert if, switch, etc. 
statements). For me that's plenty for a fast free product.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030725161510.00b21898@mail.optonline.net>

The following code successfully walks through a 3-element array:

for ($i=1;$i<=$articlecount;++$i){
   echo "<input type=\"radio\" name=\"which\" 
value=\"".$articles[$i][0]."\" 
/>".$articles[$i][1].":  ".$articles[$i][2]."<br />";

I was also trying to do it with while-list-each but this doesn't work:
while (list($key,$value)=each($articles)){
   while (list($key2,$url,$date,$title)=each($value)){
     echo "<input type=\"radio\" name=\"which\" value=\"".$url."\" 
/>".$date.":  ".$title."<br />";
   }
}

At this point I think the for-loop is best but for the sake of general 
knowledge, how do I do it the other way?  TIA.

HI All;

In case anyones wondering I never could get PEARs mime mail to work right.
As I said people on the php.pear.general list don't have an answer either.

But the htmlMimeMail class at phpguru.org works first time no muss no fuss.

Hi

Am looking for input on whether you folks think running apache 2.0.x 
with the prefork mpm is safe with regard to PHP

I realize that if I run 1.3.x I'll be golden, but am curious if anyone's 
had problems with 2.0 in 'prefork mode'

I must have done something wrong. ;)
Loaded ZDE in WinXP and it works fine. (But your experience is not
unusual...I've heard of others having problems loading it on Windoze.)

I had major install problems with ZDE on Windows.  In short, I don't use
it.
I've decided that I need to find another computer to code on (preferably
a
Linux system.)  And I'm not a Linux guy.  I'm a Win guy.

As a [possibly] help tip, numerically indexed arrays always start at 0, so $i should be initialized to 0 above

The problem is each() only can return two variables; $key2 (the key) and, potentially, $value2 (an array, containing $url, $date, etc).  The nested while() loops and the for() loop above do differant things.

I would highly recommend not using the series of while loops, even if done properly; foreach() could easily do what the while() loops do, albeit still differant from what the for() loop does.

foreach( $articles as $key => $value ) {
   foreach( $value as $key2 => $value2 ) {
      echo "<br>$key2 => $value2";
   }
}

Safe... on Linux yes; FreeBSD, no.  Production quality on either; no  :)

Using a server (in near-production) with Apache2 in prefork on RedHat, things carried along well.  There were, however, occasionly strange problems, and although I couldn't pin them down exactly, when we went to full-production, we haven't seen these issues at all with Apache 1.3.x.  I know that's a weighted response, however, so the problems could have been due to a number of things that changed between the deployments.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] @include() affects all error_reporting !?!?
Message-ID: <200307260011.h6Q0BIRr024942@gw00.com>

Good Evening!  Having trouble understanding the @ operator,
when used with include(), i.e. @include('file.php') .

	I *thought* that @include would simply suppress the
warning generated if the included file is missing.  However,
what seems to happen is more complicated:

	@include('file.php') causes error_reporting to get
turned completely OFF for the duration of the included file.
Then, even worse, when the included file ends, error_reporting
is restored to its previous state, from *before* the include
was called.  To illustrate:



/*** start of file.php ***/
    error_reporting(0);
    echo ini_get('error_reporting');  //prints 0
/*** end of file.php ***/



/*** start of script.php ***/
    error_reporting(E_ALL);
    echo ini_get('error_reporting');  //prints 2047

    @include('file.php'); // this should set error_reporting
                          // to zero, but it doesn't


    echo ini_get('error_reporting');  //prints 2047

/*** end of script.php ***/


	If you remove the leading '@' from '@include', the
desired behavior occurs, which is that changes to error_reporting
in the included file will take effect in the calling script.

	I have seen this behavior in PHP versions 4.0.8 through
4.3.2.  Does anyone agree that this is a bug?  In any case,
how can we elegantly work-around it?  I need to be able to control
error reporting from the included file, which may or may not exist.
Thanks!


Best, George.

Bad Bad Bad!

Please don't use the @ operator. An error means that >SOMETHING IS
WRONG<, and you shouldn't just throw that information away. Test for
the existence of the file and only include it if it exists. In PHP5,
use exception handling.

I recently installed GForge, and they use @ all over the place,
particular in front of the database connection code. So if your
database isn't working, you just get a blank html page. No errors, no
error log, just... nothing. It's terribly irritating, and particularly
bad coding form.

Errors are your friend!

Errors are your friend but there are often better ways to handle errors than
just allowing PHP to dump its error message to the end-user, which often is
confusing to the person unfamiliar with PHP.

For instance, opening a database connection like this:
  @ $db = mysql_connect($HOST, $MYSQL_USER_NAME, $MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD);

is much better than just saying
$db = mysql_connect($HOST, $MYSQL_USER_NAME, $MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD);
which will continue executing the script, and waste cycles, while dumping a
much less meaningful error message.

Good coding practice is not to ignore malformed input or errors BUT better
coding is to respond intelligently to errors, rather than just dumping error
messages.

I agree with Adam that errors are your friend and you should see all PHP
generated errors. This, as Jonathan pointed out, is not suffice and you need
to program some error handling on your own because your production server
should NEVER display PHP generated errors.

Daniel Kushner

This is not always true. In this particular case, the error was
"invalid function: pg_pconnect" (I installed php from rpm, and hadn't
realized that there was a separate rpm for the php-pgsql connector
even though the rpm included the --with-pgsql flag). This is a fatal
error, so the page stopped execution immediately at that line. The
additional error-reporting code included after that (if there is any;
in GForge, there isn't) never gets called.

I'm reasonably familiar with PHP, and this was confusing to me.

Agreed, but general suppression of all error reporting is bad. PHP has
a granular (but granted, not perfect) error reporting system:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php

Also, PHP5 is moving towards exception handling, and it seems like a
good time to bring up the distinction between exceptions and
errors. Exceptions are not the same as errors. Exceptions are
predictable boundary conditions that should be handled (file does not
exist, database is unavailable, etc...) and recovered from if
possible. Errors are typically unforeseen problems and should always
be presented to the user, albeit in as friendly a way as
possible. Typically, the right thing to do with an error is to
apologize to the user and send a detailed error log to someone who can
look at it and diagnose the problem.

On production servers, you should use set_error_handler to customize
error messages.

http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php

Again, not completely perfect, but the right approach is to fix the
underlying infrastructure instead of trick-coding around it. If you
absolutely HAVE to have it a certain way, do it, but don't suffer from
illusions that you're making things better by doing so.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] @include() affects all error_reporting !?!?
Message-ID: <200307261445.h6QEjm7u030128@gw00.com>

Good morning all.  Sorry I crashed last night before this
thread got under way.

	Anyway my problem remains with the behavior of
the @ operator for the include() statement.  The reason I
am using the @ operator for include() is so that I can display
my own error message, rather than the PHP's error message,
if the file is unreadable.

	Also, the code needs to work in two different
environments -- development and production.  In development,
I want the include()'d file to turn ON error_reporting,
while in production, I want it to turn error_reporting OFF.
The include()'d file is the "config" file, so that is the
natural place to put the error_reporting switch.

	Unfortunately, I can't seem to call this config file
with @include() and have the error_reporting change stick.
So what I could do is to manually turn off error_reporting
just before the include() call ... or else just deal with
having PHP's ugly error message before my nice error message
whenever the config file is missing.  -OR- I could simply
define another config parameter and manually set error_reporting
to that.

	I actually have done the latter; here is the code:

if ( ! @include ( 'StoreConfig.php' ) )
        die ( '<B>Error:</B> Store not configured (no StoreConfig.php file)' );
error_reporting ( ERROR_REPORTING ); //hack for error_reporting not working in @include'd file


	Of course I would have rather simply called error_reporting()
directly in StoreConfig.php; then we wouldn't have needed this
extra ERROR_REPORTING constant.

	Any further suggestions?

	Should I report this to bugs.php.net?  Does anyone think
the @include/error_reporting behavior is NOT a bug?  

	Thanks again for your suggestions and good ideas about
error reporting in general.


Best, George.

As pointed out in the docs about error reporting, this behavior is
known, and the "right" way to approach this is to test for the
existence of the file and only include it if it exists:

if (is_file("nosuchfile.php")) {
   include_once("nosuchfile.php");
}

This is a slightly separate problem, which you should probably address
by using a custom error handler, then switching on hostname (or even
better, setting a flag based on hostname, then switching on the flag)
to tell if you should be generating production or development
messages.

Yes, it's on it's way, certainly.  I put a CVS server online over the weekend (http://cvs.nyphp.org) which should be nice to have, too.

Can't resist putting my belated $.02 into this religious thread.

On Windoze I've long used Homesite, but there's a tendency to stay with
the first reasonable tool you learn to use. Maybe something else is
better. But anything with a tough learning curve is a buzzkiller when
you're busy. That's what's slowing me down with adopting vim on Linux.  A
good GUI is great but it's nice to be handy with a nonGUI editor for when
you SSH into a machine where you don't have the luxury of X. So I keep
trying.

Meanwhile I've been playing with eclipse on both platforms -- yes it has a
learning curve too, but it's got a lot of cool stuff going for it, and
it's free.  http://eclipse.org

ok, another 2 cents from me  again (I'm working up to a nickel) -- in 
addition to Arachnophilia (cross platform), I've used Bluefish and 
Quanta which are both "homesitish" as I'm sure you've heard.

So far as vi/vim is concerned, I use a really short 'subset' of 
functions when working remotely via ssh (I use putty on windows).  I'm 
not keen on developing with vi/vim (although I use vim for windows for 
quick file reading and occasional editing).  Of course, the "esc" key to 
get back into command mode and the "i" key to get into insert mode -- 
":wq" to write and exit, ":q!" to exit without writing when I've made a 
changes I want to ignore, and every once in a while "/" for searching.  
That's it -- otherwise it's all GUI.

John

I've tried Bluefish and there are things I couldn't figure out and for
which I couldn't find any documentation. I hear they need volunteers to
write it. Talkabout a Catch 22.

One of the things that irked me most was that I couldn't indent a block.

once you get accustomed to using visual blocks you'll realize that you
don't need anything but vim for editing.

then there's the whole issue of not having to ftp files back and forth
with the server and getting confused on versioning.

that's my 2 cents... that's 6 more cents than vim costs, btw :)

I'm a big fan of emacs in php-mode for PHP development.  It lays things
out nicely, and I can clean up other programmers inferior spacing
preferences in a snap.

More importantly, the idea of editing live files with vi/vim makes my
stomach flip.  I think any talk of using vim should be coupled with talk
of production servers vs. development servers, CVS, and rsync.  The cost
of "not having to FTP files" is far outweighed by sloppy development
standards.

My 2 cents.

8 cents and counting :)

yes, I was making the broad assumption that multiple environments
existed with some form of archiving and the employment of other best
practices (although, admittedly, on small sites, standards tend to slip)

Editing with vim versus editing with something else is a separate topic from
whether you edit on the server or have to FTP files to the server. I think you
are making some assumptions that may or may not be correct.

I have heard many editor "holy war" arguments in my time, but never have I
heard using vim likened to "sloppy development standards". :-)

To give an example, I could just as easily assume that those who mention having
to FTP their files to a remote server are doing so on production servers. I
could go on to say that there is a greater chance of overwriting someone else's
work when CVS is not mentioned, as there is typically a much larger period of
limbo than when editing the files locally on the server (unless you're using
something like UltraEdit with remote FTP capabilities, in which case it is
equivalent to editing locally on the server).

Hmm, not sure myself; installing from ports usually makes everything work  :)

Only thing I would try for trouble shooting purposes, would be to remove -DEAPI_MM and try to recompile.  If that works, check to make sure the libmm (or whatever it is) is installed.  And, run ldconfig a lot :)

Yep, tried that, I was completely stumped. It has nothing to do with libmm.

In the end, I backed out the ports version and installed imap myself 
from source -- worth a separate writeup if anyone wants it -- and 
everything worked fine from there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NYPHP: Oracle Developer Days
Message-ID: <3F280FC6.5000206@nyphp.org>


Good day,

As many have probably seen, New York PHP is organizing a day trip out to New Brunswick Hyatt (was: Edison) to attend Oracle Developer Days (ODD).  I hope to cover some of the details of our plan, and hear any suggestions and ideas.

First, what is ODD?  http://nyphp.org/eodd redirects to Oracle's monsterous URL for complete details.  Briefly, however, it's a series of workshops, focusing on Linux/RedHat, Java, Open Source, and ofcourse Oracle.  And this year, PHP is included as a workshop.  They're fairly technical, and it should be a very interesting series of programs.  Registration is free, but they say that space is limited, so please register early if you plan on attending.

As I've mentioned before, ODD happens 8/8/03 and is an all day event (8am-5pm).  So far, our plan is take NJ Transit out to New Brunswick, from Penn Station, and walk to the Hyatt hotel, which is only a couple of blocks as I understand it.  Briefly:

-- Meet at Penn Station (exact location TBD) by 6:30am to catch the 7:03 train to New Brunswick (Northeast Corridor Line).
-- [ ride on the train, walk to the Hyatt, attend the conference, walk back to the train station ]  :)
-- Meet at the Hyatt lobby by 6:00 to catch the 6:21pm train back to Penn Station.

Of course, I don't get out to NJ too much, so people familiar with this commute are welcomed to streamline it and cover things I'm probably missing :)

Useful NJ Transit links:

http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/r0070.pdf
http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/Rail_Map_04_2003.pdf


If you do plan on attending, and either meeting us there or commuting with us, let the list know.  We will wait for people before heading out, or coming back, so please contact us if you have a change of plans at the last minute (cellphones work well for this).  Maybe we should get name tags made? :)

So, that's basically it.  It should be a lot of fun, and since the conference is focused for developers, and not sales departments, I'm quite anxious to see what they have.

If you get something written up, we'll certainly get it on the site somehow :)

There is a semi-famous restaurant 2 minutes from the New Brunswick train 
station
on Easton Ave called "Cluck-U Chicken". They serve the tastiest hot wings
with 10 levels of  spiciness ranging from "sweet" to "911."

I usually order the Thermonuclear.

Buffalo wing aficionados should definitely stop by and maybe try the 911.
I heard up at the West Orange Cluck-U you have to sign a waiver
before hey sell you 911, but they don't at the one in New Brunswick.

There is a semi-famous restaurant 2 minutes from the New Brunswick train
station
on Easton Ave called "Cluck-U Chicken". They serve the tastiest hot wings
with 10 levels of  spiciness ranging from "sweet" to "911."

I usually order the Thermonuclear.

Buffalo wing aficionados should definitely stop by and maybe try the 911.
I heard up at the West Orange Cluck-U you have to sign a waiver
before hey sell you 911, but they don't at the one in New Brunswick.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NYPHP: Oracle Developer Days



Good day,

As many have probably seen, New York PHP is organizing a day trip out to New
Brunswick Hyatt (was: Edison) to attend Oracle Developer Days (ODD).  I hope
to cover some of the details of our plan, and hear any suggestions and
ideas.

First, what is ODD?  http://nyphp.org/eodd redirects to Oracle's monsterous
URL for complete details.  Briefly, however, it's a series of workshops,
focusing on Linux/RedHat, Java, Open Source, and ofcourse Oracle.  And this
year, PHP is included as a workshop.  They're fairly technical, and it
should be a very interesting series of programs.  Registration is free, but
they say that space is limited, so please register early if you plan on
attending.

As I've mentioned before, ODD happens 8/8/03 and is an all day event
(8am-5pm).  So far, our plan is take NJ Transit out to New Brunswick, from
Penn Station, and walk to the Hyatt hotel, which is only a couple of blocks
as I understand it.  Briefly:

-- Meet at Penn Station (exact location TBD) by 6:30am to catch the 7:03
train to New Brunswick (Northeast Corridor Line).
-- [ ride on the train, walk to the Hyatt, attend the conference, walk back
to the train station ]  :)
-- Meet at the Hyatt lobby by 6:00 to catch the 6:21pm train back to Penn
Station.

Of course, I don't get out to NJ too much, so people familiar with this
commute are welcomed to streamline it and cover things I'm probably missing
:)

Useful NJ Transit links:

http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/r0070.pdf
http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/Rail_Map_04_2003.pdf


If you do plan on attending, and either meeting us there or commuting with
us, let the list know.  We will wait for people before heading out, or
coming back, so please contact us if you have a change of plans at the last
minute (cellphones work well for this).  Maybe we should get name tags made?
:)

So, that's basically it.  It should be a lot of fun, and since the
conference is focused for developers, and not sales departments, I'm quite
anxious to see what they have.

Hi all:

I'm new to the list and I have a question.

I'm building a streaming media player that opens in a pop-up (a requested
one, thank goodness) and I want to do it in PHP. Basically, I want the user
to select their preferred media player -- Real (ugh) or WMP (double-ugh) --
and hit a link which saves their media player preference and pops open the
player.  Popping open the player is, of course, no problem; but retrieving
their preference is kind of sticky. Does anyone know of a good example of a
simple way to do this?

Cheers

Robert Dumas

...or require them to register/login, which would be more reliable since you
can store/retrieve the prefs server-side using sessions. Maybe you already
have an existing login process, which would make it that much easier to
implement.

...

PART
    echo "<input type=hidden name=$key value=\"" . htmlentities($val) .

For some bizarre reason, if my query string has the key of "errorMsg", in
spite of it being in cmaExceptionArray AND in spite of the fact that it does
produce the correct in_array value of "1", it still does the "echo" portion
when, in fact, it should not.

If someone were to look at this and tell me what in blazes I did wrong, it
escapes me.  As it always does :(

If client side cookies were enabled, you could set the expiration for 1 
yr ahead or something.
If the client did not accept cookies, then you'd have to go server-side 
of course.
I'm not sure that requiring registration/logins is practical, since, if 
the client can not
store cookies, the user would have to enter a login/password every time 
anyway.
And in doing so, it is more cumbersome (more key taps and clicks) than 
clicking
once to select the media player preference for the session.

I hope you don't mind if I rewrite your code a little bit to simplify it and
try to see if I understand the question correctly.

$get_array = array('foo', 'bar');
foreach ($_GET as $get_name => $get_val)
{
     $in_array = in_array($get_name, $get_array);
     echo "$get_name $in_array<br />";

     if (!in_array($get_name, $get_array))
     {
          $form_array[] = $get_name;
          echo "hidden form field for $get_name";
     }
}

So, you are saying that when you pass a URL variable named foo, you will see
output such as this:

foo 1<br />
hidden form field for foo

Right? If so, you're right that it doesn't make any sense, but I might be
misinterpreting your question.

Sounds like a plan... unless you foresee a use for maintaining state info
down the line, and reliability isn't important (since clearing your cookies
will wipe out your preference), then it's not worth the work, as Rolan
suggested. Then again, if reliability isn't an issue, is it worth any effort
at all in trying to retain the pref? That's your preference... :)

I have a TCL CGI script that has to verify if a cookie has been set.  I have
no idea how in TCL a cookie can be read (I don't think there is a native TCL
process to do this), so I am trying to fudge it by scraping a PHP script I
wrote that does just that:

TCL:
set hasFoundCMACookie 0
set hasFoundCMACookie [string trim [COMPACT_HTML [HTTP_GET $env(SERVER_NAME)
80 /cma/get_cookie.php?junk=[RAND_STRING] {} {}]]]

PHP (get_cookie.php):
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv=Pragma content="No-cache">
</head>
<body>
<?

  if (strtolower($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["username"]) === "admin") {
   echo '1';
  } else {
   echo '0';
  }

?>
</body>
</html>

The TCL proc I wrote, HTTP_GET, works, it gets the contents of
get_cookie.php and returns them.  However, it has constantly returned 0,
even if the cookie is found.  If I go directly to get_cookie.php, I get the
correct value of 1 instead.

I'm absolutely stumped as to what to do.  This sounds like another caching
issue on the part of get_cookie.php but I have no solution for it.

Thanx
Phil

I think that because TCL is making the request to get_cookie.php, there 
is no cookie being passed.
The cookie is only passed by the client broswer.

The key to finding the cookie in TCL might be the $env list?

In fact, if $env(SERVER_NAME) works, I'd try $env(HTTP_COOKIE) and see

It doesn't show up in the $env list (that is, 'username'), however
'valIdentifier', another cookie in the same domain, does show up in $env.

I don't know the syntax for passing a cookie into my HTTP_GET TCL proc, does
anyone?

Is this a TCL CGI or some version of Vignette?

There's really no need for me to save the user's state on the server side of
things; all I need to do is set (and then, later, read) the cookie.

I've read the feature on php.net about cookies, but it simply talks about
creating them. What I'll need to do is have a PHP script in the popup player
that reads the cookie and outputs the code for the correct media player.
How do I do this?

Sounds like a plan... unless you foresee a use for maintaining state info
down the line, and reliability isn't important (since clearing your cookies
will wipe out your preference), then it's not worth the work, as Rolan
suggested. Then again, if reliability isn't an issue, is it worth any effort

register/login is way morethan i need here; a simple cookie with the stored
preference will do. If they don't choose a preferred player, they don't get
the player. Simple as that.

...or require them to register/login, which would be more reliable since you

can store/retrieve the prefs server-side using sessions. Maybe you already 
have an existing login process, which would make it that much easier to 
implement.

Ok now it has turned to the bizarre.

In /cma/index.php, which sets the cookie:

setcookie('username', $username, time() + 600);
...
header("Location...");

It redirects to the TCL CGI /cma_main.cgi which in turns does NOT see the
cookie name "username" ever set.  I go to my /Phil/Cookies folder for the
cookie under the "valsignalandet.com" domain and, sure enough, "username" is
not set.  However, $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["username"] DOES exist every time I go
to /cma/index.php thereafter, in spite of nothing else showing a cookie
exists.

So, in short, "setcookie()" in PHP is setting a nonexistent cookie.

This is pure TCL CGI, although very familiar with Vignette.

Say you named a cookie 'player_type' in another script and assigned a value
of 'real' or 'wmp' to it...
Reading the value back would go something like this...
 
if(isset($_COOKIE['player_type'])) {
    if($_COOKIE['player_type'] == "wmp") {
        //...statements/output for WMP
    }
    else {
        //...statements/output for REAL player 
    }
}
 
else {
    // Cookie doesn't exist... do whatever...

Okay, here's essentially what I have for the launcher.

<form name="mediaplayerchoice" id="mediaplayerchoice" method="post"
action="<?=$PHP_SELF?>?go=1">
	Preferred Media Player:<br />
	<label><input type="radio" name="preferredmediaplayer" value="real"
onclick="<?php
setcookie("preferredmediaplayer","real",time()+60*60*24*30,"/player/","cmj.c
om",0); ?>" /> RealOne Player</label><br />
	<label><input type="radio" name="preferredmediaplayer" value="wmp"
onclick="<?php
setcookie("preferredmediaplayer","wmp",time()+60*60*24*30,"/player/","cmj.co
m",0); ?>" /> Windows Media Player</label>
</form>

So why doesn't it prompt me to save a cookie (i have "prompt for cookie"
enabled in my browser) when i press the radio input?

By the way, thanks for all the help. I appreciate it.

Say you named a cookie 'player_type' in another script and assigned a value
of 'real' or 'wmp' to it...
Reading the value back would go something like this...
 
if(isset($_COOKIE['player_type'])) {
    if($_COOKIE['player_type'] == "wmp") {
        //...statements/output for WMP
    }
    else {
        //...statements/output for REAL player 
    }
}
 
else {
    // Cookie doesn't exist... do whatever...
}

There's really no need for me to save the user's state on the server side of
things; all I need to do is set (and then, later, read) the cookie.

I've read the feature on php.net about cookies, but it simply talks about
creating them. What I'll need to do is have a PHP script in the popup player
that reads the cookie and outputs the code for the correct media player.
How do I do this?

Sounds like a plan... unless you foresee a use for maintaining state info 
down the line, and reliability isn't important (since clearing your cookies 
will wipe out your preference), then it's not worth the work, as Rolan 
suggested. Then again, if reliability isn't an issue, is it worth any effort

register/login is way morethan i need here; a simple cookie with the stored

the player. Simple as that.

Ok.  I'm sure this is possible, and it occurs to me that I've been pretty
stupid up to now for not thinking this, but...

I need to send some form data from one page, through a frameset and out to a
third party (JAVA).  At the moment, I'm switching the $_POST vars over to
the $_SESSION vars (in the frameset), then populating a bunch of hidden form
fields within one of the frames (from the session vars) and then submitting
the request via javascript.

It's gotta be possible to do all this with PHP and I'm sure it's easy.  Can
some kind soul give me the bit of knowledge I'm missing to make this happen.

Thanks,
Chris

One way to do this would be to craft an HTTP POST request and send it to 
port 80 via fsockopen() -- there's a lot of discussion about how to do 
it in the comments on this page:

You are trying to execute PHP code on the client. What you would want to do
is have Javascript submit the form
(onClick="document.mediaplayerchoice.submit();"). Then have your setcookie
call at the top of the processing page... like this:
 
setcookie("preferredmediaplayer",
$_POST['preferredmediaplayer'],time()+60*60*24*30,"/player/","cmj.com",0);
 
Basically, if you view the source of the web page after it loads as it is
now, there will be no code for the onClick event since the PHP code is
parsed beforehand and does not output anything. What you will have is the
cookie value always set to 'wmp' since you are overwriting it each time a
user hits this form.
 
HTH... let me know if it's still unclear.

Quick question:
Anyone know if there is a constant or something that contains the name
of the file that "I" was included into.
 
e.g.
 
includer.php:
<? include("codefile.inc");
    etc etc etc;
?>
 
codefile.inc:
<?
    [declare some functions, resolve world hunger, etc...]
   [but how do I figure out that I was used by "includer.php"?]
?>
 
I know about _FILE_, if I use it, it'll just return who the current file is
...
and no I don't want to pass it as an argument. Looking for something more
elegant.
 
Let me know if I am not making sense. Thanks.

You are trying to execute PHP code on the client. What you would want to do
is have Javascript submit the form
(onClick="document.mediaplayerchoice.submit();"). Then have your setcookie
call at the top of the processing page... like this:
 
setcookie("preferredmediaplayer",
$_POST['preferredmediaplayer'],time()+60*60*24*30,"/player/","cmj.com",0);
 
Basically, if you view the source of the web page after it loads as it is
now, there will be no code for the onClick event since the PHP code is
parsed beforehand and does not output anything. What you will have is the
cookie value always set to 'wmp' since you are overwriting it each time a
user hits this form.
 
HTH... let me know if it's still unclear.

Sure, you could do it all client-side too... would actually be faster. I've
never done it that way, so I don't know what other pros/cons may exist other
than the user disabling scripting (obviously a con). If you wanted to avoid
relying on Javascript in addition to cookies, you could have a standard
submit button and a javascript-free HTML form that posts to itself or
another page... and let PHP handle the cookie creation.

Just keep in mind that these values represent the resource that the client
requested:

http://example.org/blah.php

In this example, blah.php would be the resource, even if it includes foo.inc
which includes bar.inc.

If $val is the following:

...Just revamped the site's Content Management Application I built.. so do
bear in mind.. sorry!

Phil


stripslashes(htmlspecialchars($val)) should produce the following, or so I
thought:

<input type=hidden name=alert value="...Just revamped the site's Content
Management Application I built.. so do bear in mind..
sorry!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil">

Instead, I get:

<input type=hidden name=alert value="...Just revamped the site\'s Content
Management Application I built.. so do bear in mind.. sorry!

Phil">

What combo of stripslashes() and htmlspecialchars() do I use to ensure I get
a single-line entity from an HTML textarea value that could have anything in
it, plain and simple?

I think something like this will work, assuming $textarea is set to the
original value sent from the client:

if (get_magic_quotes_gpc())
{
     $textarea = stripslashes($textarea);
}
$textarea = htmlspecialchars($textarea);

Hope that helps.

Chris, this is what I have now:

echo "<input type=hidden name=$key value=\"";
    if (get_magic_quotes_gpc()) $val = stripslashes($val);
    $val = htmlspecialchars($val);
    echo "\">\n";

Based on your idea.  However, the results are still the same: I am still
getting improperly formatted values of $val inside <input..>

OK, this can't be your code, unless I'm missing something. This doesn't output
anything for the value attribute of your input tag.

Try this:

$val is [<? echo $val; ?>]
<?
if (get_magic_quotes_gpc())
{
     $val = stripslashes($val);
}
$val = htmlspecialchars($val);
?>
<input type="hidden" name="<? echo $key; ?>" value="<? echo $val; ?>">

Hope that helps.

Typically, the way this works is that whatever is providing the "CGI"
part of this for you will munge the cookies as returned in the header
into some form you can use.

If not, it should be in the HTTP_COOKIE environment variable, in
the form described in the latter two links below:

Guess you have notices turned off.  Quotes are needed around array key
strings so they don't get interpreted as constants.  So, that's really

   $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']

I've done bandwidth testing, but not between a user's browser and the server - typically it's between two servers :)

I'm not sure if there is a good way of doing this, though; if there was, the major sites like cnn.com and so forth wouldn't ask you to select the stream's speed.  Maybe there's a way to talk directly to a particular plugin and ask it what kind of internet connection it's owner configured it for, but it's probably not a good idea to saturate the client's internet link.  I suppose you could traceroute them and possibly determine from that what kind of link they're on, but I would think that's very unreliable and complex.

Message-ID: <000001c34417$59fcc460$6501a8c0@main>

Hi all,

This is a bit off topic, so feel free to ignore.

I graduated recently from college with major in Computer and Info. Science.
At this time, I'm looking into attending a graduate school to pursue an M.S.
I've looked at a few programs at different schools in NY area, including
CUNY and I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet. Fairly confused LOL. For now
I'm going to be preparing for General GREs.

One thing that concerns me is that I was a little weak at math and calculus
during college. How bad you ask? Well, I got Cs in 3 calculus courses I
took. Other than Mathematics, I did pretty good in almost every course,
mostly Bs and some As. Can anyone tell me how will that affect me as far as
my pursuit of an M.S. degree is concerned, in general? I'd also appreciate
if you can give any advice at all on the subject. 

Regards,
Nasir Zubair

That's not necessarily the end of the world.  After all, you passed
Calculus.  As long as Math was not a major or a minor, I wouldn't be
real concerned about that.

Grad programs are mostly going to be looking for your ability, or
perceived ability, to do research.  A lot of that comes from your
grades in your major, and a lot comes from any projects you may have
done in undergrad.  They also look at the GREs (I got my grad school
assistantships based almost solely on the GREs) and how much of a work
load you can handle, by looking at majors, minors, jobs, activities,
etc.  Grad school is probably the toughest thing you'll ever tackle,
and if you don't marry it, you'll never get through.  (Hence why I
stopped after the MS.)

The reason you take Calculus is that it helps you learn to think
logically and efficiently.  Those skills, along with your coding
skills, will get you through most, if not all, of your classwork at
the grad level.  The research part is a little more personal, and so
the best advice I can give you is to look up the faculty at 5 or so
schools you're considering.  If any of the listed faculty are studying
anything interesting, send them an e-mail and ask about it.  You want
your research advisor to be communicative, and to have a common
interest with you.  Don't pick a school for the nightlife, or the
surfing, or whatever, because you're not going to have time to enjoy
it much, anyway.  But if you pick by researchers, well, now you're on
the right track.

Good luck!

set a timestamp variable with javascript

send (in comments if you don't want it to show) 100K of text data

set a second timestamp variable using javascript

determine elapsed time between the two timestamps...

(seconds/100)*1.024 = Kbps

I recommend using a large chunk of data because something small, like
1k, has the potential to burst through at a significantly higher rate
than you would anticipate.

I usually run two tests and then get the mean of both results.

bear in mind that the advertised speeds of modems, etc, is in k, not K

I'll go ahead and answer my own question here before it even makes it to
the list in the event that it edifies others.

The sleep() and usleep() functions [whole seconds and 1/1,000,000 second
increments, respectively] provide this ability, and they're better than
setTimeout() because they work inline, rather than having to make calls
to another function.

Now you, too, can slow your applications down to 1994 speeds and
earlier! FUN!

Or, Jay, you could possibly use this to simulate a slow connection or
really screw up the speed test results.

site. But most of the members aren't technically proficient to work in

We'd like to discuss a system where members could work from templates
through a web browser. They'd enter information in fields and press a submit
button to create the content of a web page, and then upload. Of course the
pages would follow a main template, and the goal is not to make original
design but just to publish.

Can this be designed and implemented using php? What would the general costs
be?
