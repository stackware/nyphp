<PRE>My friend interviews people in DC for his company.  
He had a woman come in for a programming position, but more doing
advanced JS and a little CF.  He asked her to write a simple JS function
to count 1 to 10 and display the results on the browser.  She started to
cry and say that she thought it was very unfair that they ask this hard
of a question on an interview... As she was stressed out enough.

Tho that doesn't beat the ex biker transvestite turned web developer who
barely knew what a &lt;title&gt; tag was trying to ask for a 60k salary at my
company. :)

It doesn't help on Stern every morning you hear ads to become an IT
professional and make the big bucks... Advertising to bottom of the
barrel folks.  Oh well.

I think in the consulting world, its all about word of mouth these days.
If I put an ad in the paper I will be flooded with so much garbage it is
near impossible to find the needle in the haystack.

I think this is the crucial point. The explosion in need for &quot;web
programmers&quot; caused a lot of people to go into the field without a lot
of
the industrial base of skills that are useful (necessary?) when jobs
aren't
so plentiful, like now.

The worst I saw this was at my old company in Boston, after an interview
with a potential programmer. He did the standard 1 or 2 programming
questions we asked and we talked about various things. At the end, he
asked
me if we always ask programming questions in interviews. (Yes). He said
he
thought that was very tough of us, since this was the first programming
interview he'd been to where he'd actually been asked to write code!
