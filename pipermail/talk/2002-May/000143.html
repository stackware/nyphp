<PRE>hello all,

wiki is indeed impressive, and worth considering. i mentioned phpNuke in an
earlier post and will mention it again, only because it is based on PHP and,
well, isn't that what this group is all about?

I have a few NON-porn (and non-commerical) sites running it, and you can see
one of them at <A HREF="http://amoeba.janish.com">http://amoeba.janish.com</A>

Since the platform allows you to build customized modules with PHP, it may
be worth taking a look at, as it would be good practice for the community to
build in the features we need.

&gt;<i> Hello Hans,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a wiki is a collaborative, adaptive environment. The last thing you
</I>&gt;<i> want to do is set up multiple copies. That would defeat the purpose...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How stock is your wiki install?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the persistence mechanism? Did you create/use MySQL tables?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to let me onto your box and set you up properly. For
</I>&gt;<i> one thing the site looks anemic. There are several attractive themes
</I>&gt;<i> to choose from (I use MacOSX myself at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wage.packet.org/phpwiki-1.3.3/index.php">http://wage.packet.org/phpwiki-1.3.3/index.php</A> though Hawaiian is
</I>&gt;<i> very nice,) or we should create a distinctive NY php User's Group
</I>&gt;<i> theme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have already played with the wiki. Its the latest version and we
</I>&gt;<i> have GOT to get it looking like it belongs so it can earn its place
</I>&gt;<i> on the site's menu bar. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not going to mess around any more until I know its running on
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL and getting backed up every day (I burn mine to a rotation of
</I>&gt;<i> CD-RWs with weekly burns to CD-Rs I've got some community groups
</I>&gt;<i> actually starting to use it so I take it seriously now.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - - -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A weblog is like &quot;/.&quot;, or www.MacSlash.com , www.RadioFreeNation.net
</I>&gt;<i> or www.sensibleerection.com where items get contributed by the
</I>&gt;<i> community, get read and commented on by site visitors, scroll of the
</I>&gt;<i> end of the site lead page and pretty much disappear for ever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A wiki is VERY different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its a 'soup' of web pages generated from database records/rows. These
</I>&gt;<i> pages can be linked in a network of relationships. These pages don't
</I>&gt;<i> persist unless you get really sneaky and know how to implement cache
</I>&gt;<i> registration and invalidation and put it in the wiki engine,) but the
</I>&gt;<i> database record/rows which were used to generate them does persist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Creating pages is ridiculously easy. Edit a page that seems like a
</I>&gt;<i> good place to create a page at (a subtopic or sumt'in',) create a
</I>&gt;<i> PageName (a string of contiguously catenated Capitalized Words, like
</I>&gt;<i> 'CapitalizedWords') and save the page. It will reappear with a '?'
</I>&gt;<i> following the CapitalizedWords. Click on the '?' and you'll get a new
</I>&gt;<i> page to create.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Type away and save the page and you have created the page and a link
</I>&gt;<i> to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Edit any other page and anywhere you have the CapitalizedWords you
</I>&gt;<i> will have a link to the CapitalizedWords page. A page can have
</I>&gt;<i> several kinds of links. I have created a page which links to the
</I>&gt;<i> phorum. Check out the RecentVisitor's page too. Its got a table with
</I>&gt;<i> an animated graohic in one of the cells.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That page should also contain META-information about the phorum (WTF
</I>&gt;<i> is it? How you use it? Administer it? Install it? Where can you
</I>&gt;<i> obtain it from? etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - - -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody will have to decide what phorums we might want to have. I
</I>&gt;<i> suggest nothing until I read some more (did you install the docs?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - - -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure about phpWeblog. If they're using it to run their site,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not greatly impressed. Actually, I don't think people use &quot;/.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> like systems for anything serious. You might want to go with phpNuke
</I>&gt;<i> instead. I have actually found a site that uses phpNuke (Be warned
</I>&gt;<i> its a self-styled &quot;Portal of Porn&quot; at <A HREF="http://portal.900.ee/">http://portal.900.ee/</A> ) Its
</I>&gt;<i> very &quot;/.&quot;-like in format if not in, uh, content. At least it shows
</I>&gt;<i> that phpNuke works. Does anybody know of a less embarassing site to
</I>&gt;<i> use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - - -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to get snipegallery
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.snipe.net/geek/scripts/">http://www.snipe.net/geek/scripts/</A> ) installed to set up galleries
</I>&gt;<i> of images, pictures of events, members who are't camera shy, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - - -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have, of course, installed phpMyAdmin I hope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Charles-A.
