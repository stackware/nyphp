Im just wondering, not that I currently need to do this but isn't

There's a lot to be said on this topic, so let me just put a few bullets as
food for thought.

- You can't use the "ip.database.table" notation. The "database.table"
notation is correct.

- You can connect to a mysql database in a different host, so long you have
the right permissions, and it's pretty much straightforward.

- Running queries that merge data from tables located in different hosts
can be done through "data federation".  It requires additional
configuration and it can be tricky... I know big players support it (i.e.
db2), I don't think mysql does yet (but I might be wrong, starting 5.0.3
there's --with-federated-storage-engine option).

- On the other hand having master / slave settings is a very common
practice, specially in mysql. Not only for data backups, but for database
scalability. This "horizontal scalability" model is used by many big
traffic sites (flickr comes to mind). Inserts/updates/deletes are done in
one master DB, and are replicated to a bunch of slaves to run the selects.
This works on all of the sites that are read intensive (which pretty much
are most of them).

- The article is a little long, but the whole part of setting up a
master-slave combo is pretty straight forward. The mysql manual has a whole
chapter on this.
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-howto.html

- As usual the main question is: What do you want to achieve with this?
Usually your requirements and architecture will guide you to a simple
solution.

Carlos

Message-ID: <000601c63da9$8d096b90$68e4a144@Rubicon>

Sorry, another MySQL question on the PHP list, but there are so many great
users here...

I need to get all the active users email and name for personalization.

I need the correct SELECT query addressing two tables that have a one to
many relationship linked by "user_id" like the relationship shown below:

Table: Users
Fields: id   user_id 


Table: User_Attributes
Fields: id   user_id   attribute_name   attribute_value

So in User_Attributes table you see data like so:
89 78 email joe at joe.com
90 78 name joe
91 78 active yes
92 78 title CEO
93 79 email sal at sal.com
94 79 name sal
...
...


I need to get the email and name of all the users where:
attribute_name "active"  = attribute_value "yes"


I'm using this query so far:

SELECT a.user_id, b.attribute_name, b.attribute_value 
FROM users AS a LEFT JOIN User_Attributes AS b 
ON a.user_id = b.user_id 
WHERE b.attribute_name 
IN ('active', 'email', 'salutation', 'first_name', 'last_name') 
ORDER BY a.user_id 


...but this returns a rowset where each user has four rows with an attribute
value in each row.

I need all four attributes from each user to be returned in one neat row.

Additionally, I could use all the non-active users filtered out by the SQL.

Any help here?

Good to see Gentoo getting a look in - you often hear stories of people 
that have installed Gentoo on dedicated servers that were running 
something else like Fedora or RH.

BTW, anyone have a list (or URL to one) that lists Gentoo-based hosting 
companies?

Two very simple options:
1- You can join with the same table multiple times just by giving it
different alias.
So for example this following query will get all users id,

SELECT user.user_id, at1.attribute_value as name, at2.attribute_value as
email,
FROM users AS user, User_Attributes AS at1,  User_Attributes AS at2
WHERE user.user_id = at1.user_id
AND user.user_id = at2.user_id
AND at1.attribute_name = 'last_name'
AND at2.attribute_name = 'email'

you get the idea...

2- You can use subqueries, for example to get emails for all active users:
select at1.attribute_value
from User_Attributes AS at1
where at1.attribute_name = 'email'
and at1.user_id in
      select (user_id from User_Attributes AS at2 where  at2.attribute_name
= 'active' and at2.attribute_value = 'yes')

you get the point...

I know it's none of my business, but maybe you should use a query like that
one to de-normalize the table, I can't think of a good reason for such
level of normalization.

I don't think you'll get that in a one line query, but you can loop 
through and/or dump the values into an array.

quick and dirty way to print it out (assuming every id has a valid email 
& name):

$result=mysql_query("select attribute_value from User_Attributes order 
by user_id,attribute_name");
while (list($email)=mysql_fetch_row($result) {
    list($name)=mysql_fetch_row($result);
    print "$name $email\n";
}

or you could get fancy, use up some more memory and build an array:

$result=mysql_query("select user_id,attribute_name,attribute_value from 
User_Attributes order by user_id,attribute_name");
while (list($id,$attrib,$value)=mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
    $user[$id][$attrib]=$value;   # builds an array with the data
}
print_r($user);

Apart from good answer of Carlos, I would suggest something different. Instead of just finding answer of your queries, you could try to understand nature of the problem that arose due to improper structure of tables. So below points might be helpful to you in solving your problem in proper way.

=> Table "User" has those kind of fields that hold almost same type of values. I assume (from data given by you from table "User_attributes") "id" and "user_id" both are unique and holds only numeric values. So here you can use only 1 filed say "id" which is auto_increment and primary so it serves purpose of storing "user_id".

=> Probably best way is to merge both tables "User" and "User_attributes" as there is no any good advantage of this kind of normalization.

=> In table "User_attributes" values of field "attribute_value" can be fields itself as it is normal practise (unless you have many kind of attribute names.

=> Hence better structure of your tables can be like below.

Table: Users
Fields: id, name, email, active, title ....

So records in above table can be like:

78, Joe, joe at joe.joe, yes, CEO
79, Sal, Sal at Sal.Sal, no, CTO
....
....

So, if you have table structure like above, you can easily build queries to fetch whatever information you want to. Please note that values which are used in join conditions to fetch results can give best results when they are stored as fields itself. Now if you have above table structure, you can easily build your desired queries. Like below:

# SELECT id, active, email, salutation, first_name, last_name FROM Users ORDER BY id
# SELECT * FROM Users WHERE active='yes' ORDER BY id

*RSS, Atom, OPML, and All That: A Course for Developers* 
<http://cafeconleche.org/slides/nyphp/syndication/>

This February, New York PHP Community explores the world of RSS and 
related technologies. As PHP developers, we're often called upon to 
generate and read dynamic feeds. Join us this month as author, professor 
and Java developer - yes, Java developer - Elliotte Harold gives us an 
indepth look at these essential technologies.

XML based syndication is moving from its foundations in weblogs to 
unexpected arenas: source code control systems, audio narrowcasts, 
e-mail, bug tracking, stock tickers, and more. News readers like Vienna, 
NetNewsWire, RSSOwl, and Newsgator are replacing classic web browsers 
for many uses. This session explores the fundamental technologies 
underlying this explosion of content: the various versions of RSS, OPML, 
Atom, and the Atom Publishing Protocol. Learn the tricks and techniques 
for integrating these XML applications into your products as both 
clients and servers.

Elliotte is originally from New Orleans to which he returns periodically 
in search of a decent bowl of gumbo. However, he currently resides in 
the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn with his wife Beth and 
cats Charm (named after the quark) and Marjorie (named after his 
mother-in-law). He's an adjunct professor of computer science at 
Polytechnic University where he teaches Java, XML, and object oriented 
programming. His Cafe au Lait web site at http://www.cafeaulait.org has 
become one of the most popular independent Java sites on the Internet, 
and his spin-off site Cafe con Leche at http://www.cafeconleche.org has 
become one of the most popular XML sites. His books include Java I/O, 
Java Network Programming, the XML Bible, and XML in a Nutshell. He's 
currently working on the XOM Library for processing XML with Java, the 
jaxen XPath engine, and the Amateur media player.

For multiple emails, I think you want to explicitly use LEFT JOINS, to
allow some NULLs in case a particular user only has one email attribute

        SELECT 
                user.user_id, 
                at0.attribute_name as name , 
                at1.attribute_name as email1 , 
                at2.attribute_name as email2 , 
                ...
        FROM 
                Users as user
        -- with INNER JOIN users will not be returned unless they have
        -- a first_name attribute
        INNER JOIN User_Attributes as at0 ON ( 
                user.user_id = at0.user_id 
                AND at0.attribute_name = 'first_name' 
        )
        -- with LEFT JOIN, NULL will be returned if the column doesn't
        -- exist
        LEFT JOIN User_Attributes as at1 ON (
                user.user_id = at1.user_id 
                AND at1.attribute_name = 'email' 
        )
        LEFT JOIN User_Attributes as at2 ON (
                user.user_id = at2.user_id 
                AND at2.attribute_name = 'email' 
                AND at1.attribute_id != at2.attribute_id 
        )
        WHERE 
                -- whatever
        
But the "at1.attribute_id != at2.attribute_id" thing is extremely ugly,
and moreso if you begin supporting 3, 4, + email attributes

What you really need, if you want to support an arbitrary number of
email addresses, is a cursor... of course, you need a recent MySql for
that

I've a 2 part answer...

First, your problem.

He's correct, except you'll want more control within the joins than Carlos'
example.

Here's a way to do it (worked correctly on my local mysql 4.023)

SELECT
    user.user_id,
    email.attribute_value as user_email,
    name.attribute_value as user_name
FROM
    users user
LEFT JOIN
    user_attributes active ON
    user.user_id = active.user_id 
    AND active.attribute_name = 'active' 
LEFT JOIN
    user_attributes name ON
    user.user_id = name.user_id 
    AND name.attribute_name = 'name' 
LEFT JOIN
    user_attributes email ON
    user.user_id = email.user_id 
    AND email.attribute_name = 'email' 
WHERE active.attribute_value = 'yes'

> 89 78 email joe at joe.com
> 90 78 name joe
> 91 78 active yes
> 92 78 title CEO
> 93 79 email sal at sal.com
> 94 79 name sal

95 79 email another at sal.com  // and another email for good ol' sal for good
measure

produces this (sorry if spacing's off):

user_id   	 user_email   	 user_name
78 	joe at joe.com 	joe
79 	sal at sal.com 	sal
79 	another at sal.com 	sal

Close, but there's no need for a separate join for each email.

Essentially, you're getting a list of users from the users table, and then
attaching attribute values pertaining to that user per attribute.  The joins
hold their constraints on the data they need and the only 'where' condition
you need is to make sure the user is active.

This works well if only ONE of the attributes has multiple values (email in
this case).  If they would also have multiple phone numbers your results
might get messy (at least for a single query, for that you'd want different
queries per joined list).

> On Behalf Of Anirudhsinh Zala
> ...

I'm GUESSING that the reason you have the tables set up this way is for a
dynamic survey system of sorts, in which you'll want someone to be allowed
to add / remove fields as they wish without messing with the data structure.
So removing the normalization probably won't work for you in this respect.
If it's something else, you might want be sure you've good reason to make a
database engine on top of a damned fine database engine.

But, the part of Anirudhsinh's argument that I agree with is that the users
table has no purpose.  Now, if you're adding fields to it (username and
password for instance), and have your reasons for meta columns that don't
involve recreations and wheels then forget this part of the problem
entirely.  BUT, if it ONLY holds a user_id, consider getting rid of it.  You
could use this query instead (tested correctly as well): 

SELECT
    active.user_id,
    email.attribute_value as user_email,
    name.attribute_value as user_name
FROM
    user_attributes active
LEFT JOIN
    user_attributes name ON
    active.user_id = name.user_id 
    AND name.attribute_name = 'name' 
LEFT JOIN
    user_attributes email ON
    active.user_id = email.user_id 
    AND email.attribute_name = 'email' 
WHERE
    active.attribute_value = 'yes'



Good luck!!!

Sorry, another MySQL question on the PHP list, but there are so many great
users here...

I need to get all the active users email and name for personalization.

I need the correct SELECT query addressing two tables that have a one to
many relationship linked by "user_id" like the relationship shown below:

Table: Users
Fields: id   user_id 


Table: User_Attributes
Fields: id   user_id   attribute_name   attribute_value

So in User_Attributes table you see data like so:
89 78 email joe at joe.com
90 78 name joe
91 78 active yes
92 78 title CEO
93 79 email sal at sal.com
94 79 name sal
...
...


I need to get the email and name of all the users where:
attribute_name "active"  = attribute_value "yes"


I'm using this query so far:

SELECT a.user_id, b.attribute_name, b.attribute_value FROM users AS a LEFT
JOIN User_Attributes AS b ON a.user_id = b.user_id WHERE b.attribute_name IN
('active', 'email', 'salutation', 'first_name', 'last_name') ORDER BY
a.user_id 


...but this returns a rowset where each user has four rows with an attribute
value in each row.

I need all four attributes from each user to be returned in one neat row.

Additionally, I could use all the non-active users filtered out by the SQL.

Any help here?

NYPHP has a MySQL SIG, and actually discussions like these should be on that
list - there's a lot of folks on it, but not a lot of traffic yet.

I primary use Homesite as my IDE (not much of one) because I do a lot
of HTML and CSS, and I like the validation and tag completion
features.

But I like the features that PHP Eclipse has for PHP.

Is there a plugin for HTML validation and tag completion for Eclipse?

Dreamweaver has the tag completion for PHP, HTML and CSS.  It will even write some of the php code and database queries for you.  html/css also.

Yes, I've used Dreamweaver since version 1.0, and really don't need
90% of what is there. That's why I use Homesite.

That would be a pretty good talk (from their UI / design

Have a look at http://pear.php.net/package/Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer for
the Excel part of it. It's pretty astonishing how easily you can turn
database data into a spreadsheet and serve it up.

For the zip aspect of it, you might consider
http://pear.php.net/package/Archive_Zip (though I've never used it
myself).

This does not exactly solve the specific issue noted here, but this could be
useful for anyone who needs to turn the tabular data output from a database
into an Excel file on the fly. You can do this:

At the very top, first lines of code. No spaces ahead of this because this
is headers:
<?php
header("Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel");
header("Expires: 0");
header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0");

//START: GET DATA
//Make your db connection
//Get your data
//END: GET DATA

//START: DATA DISPLAY
//Format you data accurately and consistently with HTML tables, whatever
//END: DATA DISPLAY
?> 

This PHP page will force message box the user's browser 
if they have Excel on their desktop with option to save or open Excel file. 
And the data will be in nice cells and rows that match 
how you had setup your HTML above. 

I have used this successfully.

Peter

Thaks Peter. I have already done this successfully. The problem is when I try to download more that 65000 rows. In this case, I want to split them into two excel files and give the user a zip file. I want to create zip file on the file with these excel files. Is there a way to do this?

i cannot remember where or what it was but i had a class in the past that
would generate xls files and you wouldnt have to redirect the headers it
would save to the disk, you could use that with a zip class to accomplish
what you need.

search sourceforge for php excel

Planet PHP has aggregated posts galore on the Zend Framework
preview release, try the search function:

Among the more interesting as of this morning, Davey from
Pixelated Dreams (he is also the author of the Zend_Service
API classes) has an example application, with source:

OK, so it's not the Big Apple, a good slice is really hard to come by,
the bagels taste like wonder bread and you've got Johnny, but the curse
is broken. If you live in the Podunk Boston area and are interested in a
PHP gig (internship, contract, part-time or full-time possible), please
forward your resume and salary requirements to me. This can involve some
tele-commuting, but will initially require you to be on-site.

Message-ID: <ea8ff1d20603061032j72aad923q4859e95e9ab0e741@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
This is a logic issue and may be considered Off-Topic, but since I'm using
PHP for this project and I know this list is full of very smart people,
there is no better place to ask for help.

I have a page where three *different* banners ads should be displayed. I
have a pool of tens of banner ads from which the 3 banners should be
picked.  Each banner in the pool has a *weight* value which indicates how
often a banner should be displayed relatively to other banners within a
period of one month  (i.e. a banner with weight = 2 should be displayed
twice as often as a banner with weight = 1).
The set of three banners to be displayed should be rotated every hour (cron
job). The amount of impressions is not important.  The banners in the pool
and their weight values will be changed manually every month.

Well this is how it should work. However I'm not too sure how to come up
with an algorithm that will perform the hourly rotations.
I usually try to solve all my problems myself, but this time I have 2 other
deadlines by the end of today, I have a flu and this thing must be ready by
Wednesday morning.
The stress and the sickness screw with my head and I can't come up with any
logical solutions.

Any suggestions and help are greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Olaf

Every hour create a working array of display banners, where each 
banner id is entered weight times; then select the ones to be 
displayed that hour randomly from that array (checking to make sure 
that you don't accidentally select two or three the same).

I know you are looking for a smart person, but decided to reply anyway ;-)

Ever thought about using phpAdsNew?

http://phpadsnew.com/two/

Looks to do most of what you are wanting, and it is easy to integrate
ads into your site's templates/content. This might be the shortest
distance between two points.

If you looked at this and it doesn't already suit your needs, maybe
just going with Michael's proposition is the easiest way to solve the
problem.

While you are waiting for the smart people to finish cogetating, I will 
offer some thoughts.

I would need to be sure of how the performance data may be interpreted 
after the fact before choosing the algo. Usually analytics are used 
later and if they are used on this type of data (where you may have 
biased the randomization with your selection process) the analytics will 
be screwed up and nobody will know (except you and everyon eon the NYPHP 
list, perhaps). You might look at phpAdsNew, which is very good, but if 
this is your first foray into agency-style ad serving it might be more 
than a mouthful at this time.

You also have to be mindful of the client expectation, since random 
banner selection may allow chance to show a banner more frequently than 
your weighting system suggests it should. Usually the weighting is a 
specification, and may have bounds of acceptable rates.Will that cause 
any ruffled feathers? Since you say "a banner with weight = 2 should be 
displayed twice as often as a banner with weight = 1 (over the month)" 
but you also say " The amount of impressions is not important" I am not 
sure how you should impose your weights.. perhaps you mean impressions 
per 3 hours are not important? Are you sure... meaning you will never 
have to go back and "catch up" if an ad was underpresented? No need to 
round out the use of ad inventory? Single server; no need to collate 
data prior to setting next period rotation weights?

Once you pick an algo, you might  put the appropriate disclaimers to 
management (hand management a full disclosure of the 
randomization/selection process you used) so you can forget about the 
what-ifs. If they are actually thinking that they provided enough of  a 
spec to you that they can run some optimization test on the resulting 
performance data, that might make them pass your design off to the 
optimization consultant for the ok.

Knowing nothing else, I would pre-generate the array of ad_ID's to show 
for N days (default N=30) and each hour within and then simply tick 
through them as needed. Progress of time then defines your status within 
the rotation and nothing else... everything is 
measureable/quanifiable/checkable and the array can even be swapped out 
mid-stream if necessary using post-hoc analysis. I have very little 
faith in "management" sticking to such specifications as "it won't 
change within the month" ;-) especially if your systemis expected to 
scale up.

Hope there's some help in there and not just worries....

I'm very pleased to also endorse using phpAdsNew as it is a really fine
product with excellent graphical interfaces for administering banner ads and
campaigns allowing: 
- multiple ad locations on each of your web pages, 
- ad weighting, 
- hit counting, 
...and on an on. 
 
Note, though, that despite the well-planned install and setup, it has a lot
of pretty necessary documentation. 

It will take, me thinks, at least a full day to install, familiarize, and
integrate with php code. But once done, you are quite made.

Olaf:

I'm not the smart one, but I got looks instead. Let's look at your problem.

A month has a finite value. The number of banners you have is also 
finite. You also have banners that have weight, which mean that they 
appear more often than those with less weight. However, a banner with 
a weight of two really can be thought of as two like-banners.

For example, banner A has a weight of 1 -- banner B has a weight of 2 
-- banner C has a weight of 4 -- banner D has a weight of 3. Now, how 
do you show them?

While you have 4 banners, you can look at it like you have ten banners, namely:

ABBCCCDDD

Now, take all the banners you need to show in one month (ten) and 
divide the month by that value.

The end result is that you have to show each banner for a duration of 
3 days. "A" get 3 days, "B" get 3 days, the next "B" gets 3 days and 
so on. You might want to mix it up, but I wouldn't use a rand 
function, nor chron -- but rather just schedule the banners display 
beforehand. If you need to use rand, then have their banner values in 
an array and remove them from selection as they are used. That way 
you KNOW that each banner has been shown the "agreed" amount of times.

In any event, that's what I would do, your mileage may vary.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Session cookie expiration issue
Message-ID: <7AB9CE1F-B9E3-4B33-94DA-41D97541C05F@musgrave.org>

Hello -

I am using ADO DB for the first time and am also using the Session  
features.  I am having a problem with session ending while the users  
are active.

The session is set at 20 minutes.  Session is used to log into a  
password protected area.  Twenty minutes after the session id cookie  
is set, the user is forced to log out because their cookie has  
expired, even if they have remained active during that twenty  
minutes.  I have looked at the expiry field for that user and that  
date keeps on getting set 20 minutes into the future.  In analyzing  
the cookie expire date after loading a page, it doesn't change from  
the previous value.  In fact, it's never updated after it is  
originally set.  At 20:01, the cookie expires.

Why isn't the cookie expiration time being reset with every refresh?   
Am I misunderstanding something here?  Do secure cookies have  
anything to do with it?

PHP:  4.4.2
MySQL:   5.0.18


Thanks,

Stephen

Be sure that you call session_start() on each subsequent page request.
That will update the cookie.  It's often best to have a global include
file or an auto-prepend script to take care of this.  Secure cookies are
irrelevant unless you're jumping in an out of HTTP/HTTPS.

If you have SSH access to the remote machine, you might Sara Golemon's
SSH2 PECL extension:
    http://pecl.php.net/package/ssh2

It's not telnet exactly but will help you achieve exactly what you need.
And if you're crossing a public network, it's best to use SSH in place
of telnet anyway.  Plaintext protocols such as telnet & ftp are insecure
by nature.

If you can use ssh instead, check out http://us2.php.net/ssh2,
particularly http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.ssh2-exec.php

ssh2 is a pecl extension to php, and still a little buggy, but better
than nothing.

Otherwise, a quick google brought up this...

session_start() is definitely being called in every invocation of  
ever page on the site.  (It's in a global include file.)  I am not  
jumping in and out of HTTPS, so I will turn them off.

Any other ideas?

I am not too familiar with the session features of adodb, but you should 
take a look at the class/file that is being used for the session 
handler. Make sure that the method/function used to close the session is 
updating the timestamp in the database.

Stephen:

As you have experienced, session's have a 20 minute life-span if 
there is no activity from the user. Why it's not holding for you, I 
don't know.

The statement session_start() is only used once per script -- I don't 
know if it's reactivated by calling it from another script or not.

You could try activating session_start() and then regenerating 
another session_id() by using session_regenerate_id(). It goes like 
this:

ob_start();
session_start(0;
session_regenerate_id();
ob_end_flush;

This just changes the session_id while leaving all the data intact -- 
that may reset the time.

Another idea, to maintain the session state, is you might try using 
cookies by sending a cookie with the name PHPSESSID to the client. 
However, you need to have session_use_cookie = 1 in your php.int.

If the client doesn't support cookies, then you can use 
session_use_trans_sid = 0 and then PHP will automatically appends the 
session ID to the URL.

The other option is to not allow sessions at all, but instead only 
use cookies by changing session.use_only_cookies = 1 in you php.int 
directive.

That's all I can find and think of.

Are you changing the session data?  After a quick look through the
source, it appears that if the data does not change, adodb will not
update it, and will also not update the session expiry field.

Try adding something like $_SESSION['lastaccess'] = time(); to your
include file to ensure that the session will be updated on each page load.

If that is the case, it may be worth opening a bug report for adodb.

Hmm, I may have jumped the gun there. It looks like it should still be
updating the expiry date.

If I were you I would take a look through the sql logs and see exactly
what it is executing.

Nope, that's not the case.  I did a search and it's only in my config  
file

I experimented with that and it seemed to work just fine, but it  
seems like overhead that I didn't want to incur right away.  ;-)   
Plus, it might be harder to debug another problem down the line if  
the session ID of the client is constantly changing?

The session ID is definitely on the client as a cookie.  This app is  
in a closed environment, so I can count on that.

Thanks again for your ideas,

Session is being constantly updated with various state information.

Have you tried plain sessions sans adodb?  If not, you might want to check
to be sure sessions are working properly on your php setup before you put
too much time digging into the library.

Check out your phpinfo().

Look for session.gc_maxlifetime.

It defaults at 1440 (in seconds = 24 minutes)

>From the manual:

"session.gc_maxlifetime specifies the number of seconds after which data
will be seen as 'garbage' and cleaned up.

Note: If different scripts have different values of session.gc_maxlifetime
but share the same place for storing the session data then the script with
the minimum value will be cleaning the data. In this case, use this
directive together with session.save_path. 

Note: If you are using the default file-based session handler, your
filesystem must keep track of access times (atime). Windows FAT does not so
you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your
session if you are stuck with a FAT filesystem or any other filesystem where
atime tracking is not available. Since PHP 4.2.3 it has used mtime (modified
date) instead of atime. So, you won't have problems with filesystems where
atime tracking is not available. "

Considering that, you may also want to consider checking the differnece
between the time on your server and the time on your mysql server (if
they're separate).

Also 

session.cookie_lifetime  integer

"session.cookie_lifetime specifies the lifetime of the cookie in seconds
which is sent to the browser. The value 0 means "until the browser is
closed." Defaults to 0. See also session_get_cookie_params() and
session_set_cookie_params(). "

If these are off, you'll want to update your php.ini.  If you've no control
over it, check out:

Let us know what you find out!!

Hi there:

I'm a little stumped about quite how to proceed with sorting out a problem.

I just set up a web server at servermatrix for a client, and a rather 
complicated site.  We're on a redhat linux box with cpanel.

One of the features of the site is a postcard->email thing, and they 
were complaining about not being able to receive email via this 
feature.  However, every time I tested it, I was receiving it.

So, I put a small script on the server that just sends dummy text via 
mail().  Again, I received the emails.

I had them give me an email address on their company domain, and - 
voila - i didn't receive any emails I attempt to send to that account 
from the server.  It appears not to have anything to do with 
client-side spam filters, though of course I can't know what spam 
filters are installed at the various domains.

Apparently, mac.com and hotmail.com are other known problem domains.

The question is:  what circumstances could make this new server only 
be able to email certain domains, and how can I go about finding it 
out?  How can I find out what problems the server may be having?

This is all new for me; never seen anything quite like this before. 
If anyone has any "If I were you, I would ______" advice, it'd be 
greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Are they hosting their email on the same server as the script? If they are
not, you'll want to make sure the server is aware of this.

In a situation where the email is hosted elsewhere but the server is not
aware, it (the server) will try to send the email to itself without actually
looking at the record for what server the email is actually supposed to go
to. 

Not sure how that would be corrected on your setup, but I've seen that
happen before. Server GUI's like CPanel tend to assume they are handling
email when you set up an account.

I haven't brought myself to that point yet because I've been hoping  
it is something obvious.  It seems to me that it isn't so much  
session as it is the session ID cookie.  The expiration date on the  
cookie is always the original value when set - it never changes.   
Yes, maybe that is a problem with the manager (ADODB) but something  
this basic seems unlikely?  I'm still thinking that *I* have done  
something wrong in how I have set up the config.

This looks good, in fact I am using
ini_set("session.gc_maxlifetime", 1800);
and php info shows that the override is being picked up.

> "session.cookie_lifetime specifies the lifetime of the cookie in

Ah, now we're onto something.  I found the problem.  I did something  
pretty lame and when using the session_set_cookie_params() function  
(so I could set secure cookies), I set the first parameter to the  
session time maxlifetime instead of 0.

Thank you all for your suggestions!

Thanks,

Stephen

Since you mention cPanel, I'm assuming you're on a shared host. If 
you look at the full headers of an email you received, you will see a 
header that looks something like

      Return-path: <nobody at the_domain_of_the_shared_host.com>

This header should be of the form

      Return-path: <someuser at your_domain.com>

In order to get this to happen, you need to use the fifth parameter 
to the mail() function.

     $param5 = '-f someuser at your_domain.com';
    mail($to, $subj, $message, $headers, $param5);

This is probably not a PHP issue.
It sounds like there might be an problem with the mail server on your 
web hosting environment. Either a configuration issue or the server ip 
could be on a blacklist. I run a few mail servers that permit users to 
configure auto forwarding of  email to other addresses. Unfortunately, 
these customers receive a lot of spam which is also forwarded to their 
accounts at Yahoo. Yahoo has lately become more aggressive with their 
spam blocking by employing techniques like throttling or even temporary 
rejection of all email from an ip when too much spam has been received 
from one source. Because of this, email going to Yahoo has occasionally 
been delivered slower than the normal 1-2 second delay. On a shared 
hosting environment, there could be hundreds of websites sending 
spam-like mail to hosts like yahoo. The more sites there are hosted on 
one ip, the more likely they are to be throttled or blocked. If this is 
the case, you might have to resort to hosting on a dedicated server to 
obtain any reliability in sending mail.

Hi All,

I wrote some code over a year ago that resizes an image when it's

this code is now broken.  All the images are properly resized but  
they are a weird grayscale mess. Is there a fix for this?

When I was researching this sort of thing, I found

http://www.vasoftware.com/

very interesting. However, a little too much change at once for us, so we
host our own SVN server in house. It hasn't caused any major headaches.

Look at your function calls, it may be that you need to update your  
code to use the function imageCreateTureColor instead of imagecreate.  
It has been a while, but I had a similar problem and that was the fix  
(you will have to check the exact function names in the PHP manual).  
Hope that helps.

Hey all,

I'm writing some PHP that expects some GET data, uses it to build SQL
query, XMLifies the data from the result and echos it. The client is
Javascript that submits an xmlhttp request. Suppose some of the GET input
doesn't validate. Is there a convention/best practice for throwing an
error to signal the client something is wrong -- e.g., do you send an HTTP
error code in a header or some such? Or just echo something like
<error>error message here</error>?

Thanks,

To partly answer my own question, after further reflection: no, I would
think HTTP error codes are for protocol-level issues rather than
application/data validation. I guess the client should check the
response by looking for, e.g., an <error> element. ?

Message-ID: <edce57650603101049g57eda915q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

Sorry for not knowing my file handling routines 101, but I'm somewhat
desperate at this stage, so here it goes.

I have a mail server that sends 200 000 emails daily, no mistake 200K with
qmail-send, to a mailing list.
Sometimes older users just add another email address and fail to erase the
old one so I need to comb through the mailbox regularly to find which
addresses  are bouncing so I can delete them.
all messages have more or less the same configuration, and we have a shell
app that compiles the name of the email file and the header onto a text
file, something like this:

 ./1141578003.21775.ns31756.ovh.net,S=41699
Return-Path: <>
Delivered-To: root at myserver
Received: (qmail 20952 invoked for bounce); 5 Mar 2006 16:59:17 -0000
Date: 5 Mar 2006 16:59:17 -0000
From: MAILER-DAEMON at myserver
To: root at myserver
Subject: failure notice

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at myserver.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<the recipient>:
IPADDRESS does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 <the recipient> is not a valid mailbox
Giving up on IPADDRESS

--- Below this line is a copy of the message.



Now, I need to extract the file name, the date, the recipient and the error
onto a database to check which addresses have bounced and why.

Anybody has some ideas on how I can do that?
I looked on the net and the php manual and found some disparate tentatives
but no solid solution when we are not using an xml file.

TIA

David's link is right on...

Here's a discussion about it as well that might have some more options if
the mysql manual page doesn't solve your woes:

I have a couple customers who have used CVSDude - http://cvsdude.com/ - 
and they've been pretty happy with it.  I switched one user away just 
because they wanted to integrate it more tightly with some of their 
other apps on a dedicated server.

It looks like the "More Developer" plan would suite your needs.... SVN, 
Bugzilla, and Trac.

Yeah, I found those guys and it looks like they offer a nice package.

Another option I'm honing in on is VPS -- looks pretty reasonable and
flexible.

https://www.rapidvps.com and http://www.vpsland.com/ seem to have
reasonable pricing. Just don't know if I'd be turning myself into a
sysadmin again. And can't figure out which Linux OS to select and
whether I need Plesk or Cpanel if its just for a development server. And
I'd be tickled pick if one of these outfits could actually tie the
various RAM levels they offer to actual performance needs.

People,

Thanks - I already solved my problem and yes it had to do with
re-setting the password using 'OLD_PASSWORD('password')'

If your script handles these as individual emails, then you could use
PEAR's MIME parser or one of the imap functions to parse the headers.

Otherwise, well, each message can be converted to an array of lines
using explode(). Each line of the headers starts with a label. Then
there's a blank line, and then the message body itself.

Liberal use of strpos(), substr(), etc. should be all you need. Maybe
some preg_match() if the regular string functions aren't quite enough.

Chris,
Any thoughts on which pattern to use on that explode, or just newlines?

I've used the Geocode DB from zipinfo.com for clients before - not sure
what data you want about the zips.  They have monthly updates available.
Their data has had some anomalies in the past (zips w/ lat/lons in the
middle of the Atlantic) but they were quick to fix them in the next
update when we notified them of what we found.

HTH,

Caution.  I know other people have obviously had positive experiences
with VPS and/or 'root servers' from 1&1 or other companies.  I did
not.

I found it to be one of the most dissatisfying experiences of my
consulting career.  I wasted 10x the amount of time I would have spent
just doing the sysadmin work myself.  The installation and setup of my
accounts were buggy.  The software (cPanel or Plesk) were useless. 
That software is not nearly as useful as Webmin.  More than anything,
managing the server through the terrible 'control panel' was the
really bad part.  And there was incongruous language in their
advertising and TOS that ended up biting me too.

Now that someone has said this, I will agree.

I still use Westhost Virtual Server accounts for a few projects, and I 
*think* I appreciate that I don't have as many sysadmin/security 
concerns as I have with other dedicated servers. However, I find the 
control panel (which is actually a PHP/DHTML application) horribly slow 
and an unwelcomed intermediary between me and the system. Luckily I can 
ssh in for *most* things when I want to.

If you want to re-install a base system, though, it is pretty easy to 
reset the virtual server and start fresh. Not sure how often I could 
accomplish that with the dedicated servers without being ready to pay 
for some hands-on support or make a site visit.

Well, I settled on cvsdude for Subversion, Bugzilla and Trac. 

And I'm giving a XEN-based VPS provider a try -- will report back my
experience.

On another note, wasted a few bucks and a few hours trying Dynamic DNS
to just use my office dev. server, which is behind a Firewall and NAT.
Fugetaboutit... Talk about a pain. And then there's all the fine print
about "if your service provider blocks port 80..." Waste of time....

For what it's worth: I use DynDNS, a Linksys BEFVP41 router (ipSec) and the
SSH Sentinel client to "talk back" to my office whilst on the road.  If the
stars align and the creek don't rise (and the ISP in between doesn't
f$#k-it-up) things work just great...e.g. once in a blue freaking moon.

This definitely isn't Kansas Toto.

If anyone is interested in hearing more, contact me off-list and I'll tell

The application I'm working on along these lines returns an error 
code/message in the body, not the header.  Provides more fexibility in 
explaining the issue to the front end/users.

Hi,
   
    I have the following query dynamically generated in php.
   
  select CompSecDes,ID,SecDes, CAST(CapitalNumShare AS int) as CapitalNumShare,NCapitalNumShare,CAST(CapitalShareStock AS int) as CapitalShareStock,NCapitalShareStock,PriceMonthOpen,NPriceMonthOpen,PriceMonthLastDay,NPriceMonthLastDay,Year from [tablename] where year between 1869 and 1869 and Month between 1 and 12 and ID in (select distinct ID from tablename where CompSecDes ='"Illustrated London News" & " Sketch" ordinary')
   
  This works perfectly fine in mssql query analyzer. But when this is executed through php no rows are returned. Should I not use "in" and subquery in php. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
   
  Thanks,

While this isn't your problem, a heads up.  Do not use delimited 
identifiers or identifiers that requirie delimiting.  Doing so WILL cause 
you grief in the long run.

All PHP does is pass the the query to the database server.  Two possible 
reasons for your problem are your PHP script is not connecting to the 
server/database you think you are or there is a bug in you PHP code.

Thanks Dan. I am left with non choice than to use delimited identifiers. I am getting no error with respect to connection. It clearly states zero rows returned. I need to figure out where the bug is!!!

For those who aren't click-happy, it is worth looking at.  The Caucho
guys have implemented a PHP 5 engine called Quercus in 100% java (*no* C
code from zend/php core is used) that runs on their app server, Resin.
They have 3 major PHP 5 apps running on it: MediaWiki, Mantis and
Drupal.  The set of extensions implemented isn't nearly complete, but it
is an impressive start.  See:
    http://caucho.com/resin-3.0/php/index.xtp
    http://wiki.caucho.com/Quercus
(The latter is a link into their dogbowl installation of MediaWiki
running on Quercus)

Pretty hot.

Xampp as I already have Apache and MySQL running.

For mcrypt, Before building PHP, do the following, substituting the 
current mcrypt version numbers as needed...

wget http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mcrypt/libmcrypt-2.5.7.tar.gz
wget -O libmcrypt-2.5.7.umn.tar.gz http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mcrypt/libmcrypt-2.5.7.tar.gz

md5sum libmcrypt-2.5.7.tar.gz
md5sum libmcrypt-2.5.7.umn.tar.gz

tar xvzf libmcrypt-2.5.7.tar.gz
rm libmcrypt-2.5.7.*

cd libmcrypt-2.5.7
./configure
make
make install
make clean
cd ..

You could take a look at Zend Core.  That will give you a PHP 5.0.5 set up 
with the extensions you're looking for on RHEL.  It'll detect your 
existing Apache (doesn't come with its own) and it doesn't include MySQL.  
You can activate mysql, mysqli from the Zend GUI though.

Message-ID: <2ca9ba910603140930sa63739bvddd3f8229c479fd8@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings from TX you chilly state-tax-paying nerds! I hear the
group's alcohol consumption has diminished dramatically since I left.
I bet T.G.I.F misses me the most.

I actually have a question for y'all (all'y'all? y'all all?). Is it
possible to get the variable name used by an object from that object?
If I had

class Example {	
	function varName() {
		// what goes here?
	}
}

$nyphp = new Example() ; $txphp = new Example();

I want $nyphp->varName() to return the string 'nyphp', and
$txphp->varName() to return 'txphp'

Here is a completely dirty hack that probably won't work quite right and 
probably takes way to long:

function varName()
{
     foreach (get_declared_vars() as $key => $value) {
         if ($value === $this) {
             return $key;
         }
     }
}

Other than this, I don't see how it can be done.

Not that I'm aware of.  You'd need access into the symbol tables.
Sounds like a nice extension.

On a related note, recently I've been itching for a wat to get the
Object ID of an object and possibly way to dereference it.

I mean the one that comes out when you do:
    class a { }
    $b = new a;
    print $b;
    # Output:
    # Object id #1
Yes, output buffering would work but that isn't quite right.
debug_zval_dump() has the same issue.

Ideas?

Thanks,
Andrew

strval($b) will return the string 'Object id #1'. Not sure if that is 
exactly what you are looking for but it is a start.

I believe you gett the same result from casting it like:
    $c = (string) $b;
But there is no way to dereference that value though, AFAIK.

Hi All,

So I'm installing for the zillionth time a new issue tracker at work.
My main concern is that it has to be simple to use (and php/mysql).

Any comments on Arctic?

http://www.olate.co.uk/products/arctic/

btw, here are couple of good lists of issue trackers:

Hi Ophir,

Have you tried Trac?

http://www.edgewall.com/trac/

My experiences with it have been very positive, primarily because it 
lacks many features that I don't really need. Instead, it elegantly 
combines some features that help organize a project - repository 
browsing, issue tracking, and a wiki.

Chris

+1 for Trak. Also Mantis works good, although I haven't admin'ed it nor

Hello,

I'll be presenting "The MySQL Database" to Unigroup tomorrow evening for
anyone interested.

http://www.unigroup.org

The theme will be MySQL as the number one open source database and how it
got that way, which will include it's impact on the database industry from a
business standpoint.

I'll also go over in fair detail technical aspects, features, features
coming 5.1, a little on Cluster, and the future, including the impact of
recent acquisitions of related companies.

Hello folks,

Carlos Hoyos and I have put together a recommended reading list for PHP 
for the IBM developerWorks open source zone.

As you might expect, it's geared primarily towards those intending to work 
with Zend Core for IBM or the free DB2 Express-C, but we've also included 
broad coverage of topics that apply to many aspects of PHP development and 
it links to a few past NYPHP presentations on topics such as image 
manipulation and source control as well.

We're hoping to regularly revise the list, so if you come across anything 
that should be included in a later version, please let us know (we sent it 
off for publication a few weeks back, so we know it's missing things like 
the Zend Framework).  Likewise, if there's something wrong or broken in 
there, please pass along your corrections.

Recommended PHP reading list

-Dan

Hans -

Will there be an audiocast/vidcast/podcast/archive of this?

Also, does anyone attend the MySQL meetups in NY?  I noticed they  
meetup at a "roadhouse" (bar?), im just wondering if its actual talks/ 
presentations or just a get together, the Boston UG vids on Google  
are super informative ...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Arctic Issue Tracker - Any Good?


Hi All,

So I'm installing for the zillionth time a new issue tracker at work.
My main concern is that it has to be simple to use (and php/mysql).

Any comments on Arctic?

http://www.olate.co.uk/products/arctic/

btw, here are couple of good lists of issue trackers:

Not too sure - I'd guess no, but you'd have to contact Unigroup to be sure.

Yeah, it's a bar.

Sometimes... I used to organize it but have handed it over to Philip, who's
an SE at MySQL.  He's a good guy...

I have to second your suggestion of Eventum. We just installed it on
our customer facing site and it works like a dream. Haven't had a lot
of time to work with it but it seems to be very full featured.

Message-ID: <8d9a42800603151714y3b1befd2ma8b356ca5e898743@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

i am having an issue here, i am trying to display images on a site with it
masking the actual image location, we are grabbing circuit city's images
(with permission)
to be shown on our site, we have all the url's in the db so i created an
image.php file that we will use in our image links, here it is

<?php
include_once('config/config.php');
include_once(LIBRARY.'ConnectionPool.php');

$imgType = (isset($_GET['type'])) ? ucfirst($_GET['type']) : 'Item';
$rowID = (isset($_GET['img'])) ? $_GET['img'] : null;

if(!is_null($rowID)) {
    $dblink = new ConnectionPool(true);
    $sql = "SELECT ".$imgType."_Image as image FROM MasterItems WHERE
Record_ID=".$rowID;
    $res = $dblink->db_query($sql);
    $row = $dblink->db_fetch_object($res);

    $cookieFile = BASE_PATH.'cache/circuitcities.cookie.txt';

    $ch = curl_init($row->image);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_REFERER, 'http://circuitcity.com/');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT
5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1");
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_ENCODING, "gzip,deflate");
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, $cookieFile);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, $cookieFile);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    "Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9
,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5",
    ));
    $source = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    header("content-type: image/jpeg");
    echo $source;
}
?>

In FireFox when you hit the page you see a broken image (txt url in mine)
however if you view source you see the binary from the image.

This works fine if i hard code the url in curl_init, and i have tried
urlencode() and trim() on the url before feeding it to curl.

you can see the file in use here

http://b2cdev.licketyship.com/image.php?img=50903

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Hey Dan,

I'd also add PHP 5 Power Programming by Gutmans, Bakken and Rethans.

Message-ID: <5458518f0603151922h2abf8dcfx4fa38e629f8e372a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I've been using PHP 4 and am very comfortable with it. I've developed
several major products in 4 and they work very well and are stable.
Lately, I've had a few clients ask me about PHP 5 and if they should
migrate over to it because it's the latest and greatest. I've always
told them no because of the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" rule.

But lately, I've been wondering about switching myself.

Is it advantageous for me, as a web developer, to begin switching my
projects over to PHP 5 and OOP even if the old way is working fine?
I'm not seeing too many jobs that require 5 knowledge and I notice
that a mass migration of hosting providers to PHP 5 has yet to happen.

What does everyone think? Is learning and switching over to 5 now
worthwhile or should I wait until it's been more fully adopted by the
community?

Thanks!

We've agonized over the same decision for months. However, with an
application the size and complexity of Joomla, combined with the
active development and slow migration towards a more framework-like
model (as opposed to just a CMS), we all agreed that PHP5 and a more
OO-based approach was necessary.

The next major release of Joomla (2.0) will most definitely require
PHP5. There is just no way to get around it. There are too many things
that we want to take advantage of to stick with the 4.x environment.

Of course another interesting factoid is that a big chunk of the core
developers are also java guys, so we are left wanting even with 5.1
LOL

For me, the real question is - when folks do switch, are they going to
5.0 or jumping 5.0 and going straight to the more current 5.1?

Anthony:

I haven't made the jump myself, but am interested in doing so.

However, I read somewhere that less than 10 percent of php 
programmers have made the switch -- can anyone support/disclaim that 
statement?

not, this way if I run into a time for a need to use it I wont have to 
hope its gonna work i will know it will.

How do you figure it's free?

You can download a chapter or so, but the book is not free nor is 
there a free download for the complete book.

I think Jeff is talking about a different type of free. It's published 
under the Open Publication License.

published under the Open Publication License, an Open Source

Hmmm... they removed the link though, those bastards. Well, at least
it was free & fully downloadable when I posted that link a while back.
I know I got mine.

Me too.  It is the entire book.

They burried the link.  It's on this page:

With that in mind... you should download any other interesting book
you see there before they change their minds about that one. Many of
the other books are still available for download.

I don't want you to violate any copyright, but any chance of redistribution?

Such as send it via a zip file to those who ask (I'm asking).

The complete book is here:

http://www.phptr.com/content/images/013147149X/downloads/013147149X_book.pdf

I have the (hardcopy) version of the book.  I think it's a good, useful, 
book.  I've noted a number of typos in the code examples, however, which 
will keep you on your toes as you read through it.  Given that the 
download is the galley proof of the book as it went to press, these typos 
haven't been corrected in the PDF.  (Contrast with O'Reilly's commitment 
to maintaining errata for their books...)

"PHP Hacks" by Jack Herrington, O'Reilly 2006

This very current and succinct book moves really fast providing 
surgical enlightenment on several PHP programming crucibles, such as: 
maps on web pages, parsing XML, using MD5, dynamic image overlays, 
getting Excel into a database, sending HTML mail, and, yes, even a single 
lucid AJAX example.

Cleverly leverages existent PHP projects and modules at every turn 
to expedite every task.

Contains an explicit multi-platform "How to Install PHP, PEAR and MySQL"
with
special notes for shared environment web-hosting.

Hello folks,

Carlos Hoyos and I have put together a recommended reading list for PHP 
for the IBM developerWorks open source zone.

As you might expect, it's geared primarily towards those intending to work 
with Zend Core for IBM or the free DB2 Express-C, but we've also included 
broad coverage of topics that apply to many aspects of PHP development and 
it links to a few past NYPHP presentations on topics such as image 
manipulation and source control as well.

We're hoping to regularly revise the list, so if you come across anything 
that should be included in a later version, please let us know (we sent it 
off for publication a few weeks back, so we know it's missing things like 
the Zend Framework).  Likewise, if there's something wrong or broken in 
there, please pass along your corrections.

Recommended PHP reading list

Thanks,

Has anyone mentioned the PHP security books by Chris and Ilia? Both are

"PHP Hacks" by Jack Herrington, O'Reilly 2006

This very current and succinct book moves really fast providing 
surgical enlightenment on several PHP programming crucibles, such as: 
maps on web pages, parsing XML, using MD5, dynamic image overlays, 
getting Excel into a database, sending HTML mail, and, yes, even a
single 
lucid AJAX example.

Cleverly leverages existent PHP projects and modules at every turn 
to expedite every task.

Contains an explicit multi-platform "How to Install PHP, PEAR and MySQL"
with special notes for shared environment web-hosting.

In order to avoid my flooding this PHP list with MySQL questions, can
someone please point me to a fast-acting MySQL list where
questions/issues get addressed just as quickly and dynamically as they do
here on the premiere NYPHP list.

For example, I need to know:

If I have a MySQL table with, say, 200 rows of entries already in it.
The table has been using auto-increment.
Client wants to manually re-number these first historic 200 entries
according to how they were numbered 1-200 when originally entered by hand in
the paper ledger.
So, can I just remove auto-increment with a table schema update. 
Then manually rejuggle the numbers in the now dead auto-increment field.
Then put auto-increment back and MySQL will happily start auto-incrementing
again at 200 without a hitch.

Yes, I also recommend that book. I read most of it yesterday, ordered 
it through Amazon last night, and received notice that it was 
shipping today. Fast world.

Another book I highly recommend (very inexpensive $14.99 US) is "PHP 
Phrasebook" by Christian Wenz. It's not a beginners book, but 
provides a lot of good advice backed up by code.

I agree completely, it is for intermediate user sliding into new places on a
monetary and time diet who is doing a little candy store browsing.
Definitely not a cornerstone. 

Meanwhile, both Chris Shiflett's "Essential PHP Security" and Chris Snyder's
"Pro PHP Security" are on the recommended list.

There is already a SIG list for MySQL ...

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/mysql

I find the main lists and the MySQL forums pretty quick/responsive ...

http://lists.mysql.com/
http://forums.mysql.com/

As for the question I beleive phpmyadmin has an operation for this +  
looking it up the call is something like ...

ALTER TABLE t AUTO_INCREMENT = x

The last time I did something similar I attached a temp_id field and  
looped through + set it, dropped the pk(id) field and renamed, this  
was not a large dataset however.

'SERVER_NAME' -- The name of the server host under which the current

will be the value defined for that virtual host. 

'HTTP_HOST' -- Contents of the Host: header from the current request, if
there is one. 

So in English that means? Aren't these the same thing?

If I have several URLs points at the same server and want to setup my

I should be using http_host, not server_name?

How far out on the horizon is php 6?  If it looks like it will happen
any time soon, I suspect that many people/projects will jump directly
from 4 to 6 in order to benefit from Unicode support, etc.

Does anyone know the target release date/quarter?

This is provided by the client and is therefore tainted.

Usually, except when you have a vhost w/ a bunch of other aliases
(ServerAlias directive in Apache) like you describe below.

Yes, but consider the above.  Validate it as if it were form data.

http_host is going to be whatever the user sent you.  server_name is going 
to be whatever the ServerName directive in Apache says.  These may be the 
same, or may be vastly different.  Using http_host may be dangerous.

A) user asks for "example.com".  Apache's setup catches the request with a 
VirtualHost block with a ServerName of "example.com".  Both variables are 
the same.

B) user asks for "example.com".  Apache's setup catches the request with a 
VirtualHost block with a ServerName of "www.example.com" and a ServerAlias 
of "example.com".  server_name should now be "www.example.com" while 
http_host is still "example.com".

C) user asks for "<script>hack me! hack you! hack everyone!</script>".  
Since that isn't set up as a ServerName in your Apache setup, Apache's 
setup catches the request with the DEFAULT VirtualHost block with a 
ServerName of "www.example.com" and a ServerAlias of "example.com".  
server_name should now be "www.example.com" while http_host is 
"<script>hack me! hack you! hack everyone!</script>".  Echoing http_host 
back to the user is possibly dangerous.

I think we've had this discussion before about script_name and php_self and 
so on.  Don't trust user input.

Realistically, modifying that demo to use php4 and replacing the pear
dependencies with sha1 and curl calls would be a trivial task, and imho
there is no reason for requiring php5 in this instance aside from poor
coding.

There are limitations to what can be done in php4, but right now I see
no compelling reason for the majority of code out there to move to php5,
especially as the vast majority of web servers are still running php4,
and quite a lot of them php4.3.x.

That said, I am very excited at the prospect of real unicode support in
php6.

There's more to this than meets the eye, so I decided to blog about it:

http://shiflett.org/archive/211

The short answer is that HTTP_HOST is the Host header from the HTTP 
request, and SERVER_NAME is provided by the server but can be affected 
by the Host header in certain circumstances.

Hope that helps.

If only it were that simple.

The contents of $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] is also dependent on the setting
of UseCanonicalName in the relevant section of your Apache or
VirtualHost config.

If UseCanonicalName is On, $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] will contain the
ServerName specified in your Apache or VirtualHost config, regardless of
the Host: header sent by the client.

*However* if UseCanonicalName is Off, $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] will
contain the same (potentially tainted) value as $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].

$_SERVER['SERVER_SIGNATURE'] will also contain whatever is specified in
the Host: header, however at least on my test server it will have html
special characters escaped.

Thank you all who replied with your thoughts on this topic. It's
definately cleared up a lot of issues for me and, for now, I'm going
to stick with 4. But I am definately going to spend the time it takes
to at least *learn* 5 so I can be ready when the mass migration
happens.

One suggestion I have is to develop your applications to work on both 4
& 5 now.  That will make your life easier when the masses (such as your
web host, colleagues, and developers of 3rd party software/libs you use)
migrate to PHP 5, while allowing you to run them now on servers that
currently run PHP 4.  You don't need to learn all the new features -
learn them as you need/want them.  Focus on getting your apps working on
both gets you started.  Adam Trachtenberg's Upgrading to PHP 5 is a
great book on this subject.

I don't know that if has been discussed publicly, but PHP 4 may be
sunsetted sometime in the next couple of years.  This may force the mass
migration at some point.  PHP 4 is only receving bug and security fixes
as it is now.  No new major releases are planned.  It may only a matter
of time.  However, at the same time, the PHP community is huge, and the
PHP 4 install base is also huge.  It has had a longer life than PHP 3
did... whose last release was in Oct 2000, just 5 months after PHP 4 was
first released in May 2000.

HTH,
Andrew

I don't believe one has been set.  Here is the PHP 6 TODO list for
reference:

And Derick Rethans notes from a meeting of the core developers detail on
the items in the TODO list:

A good strong dose of skepticism is very healthy in this case.

 I use PHP because it is fast and stays close to the edge of development 
in the world of web apps including interfaces. AJAX is a buzzword... 
it's new, it's often flaky, and compared to total need for user 
intefaces it doesn't apply to the vast majority of cases.

That is not to say it isn't important. I'm just saying it isn't "the 
answer" yet, and it is very, very young. Sure any new Windows shell is 
important to all application developers, but not because of some hook 
between AJAX-y screens and PHP.

Of course this part is very funny (from that website):       
"evangelists are NOT marketing"

That statement caused me to choke on my probably-too-hot-to-be-drunk 
coffee. After all this is Vista promo week.. do we need to clutter up 
the PHP talk list too?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Tracking sendmail usage by PHP?
Message-ID: <441B1637.80106@bitblit.net>

To track web server abuse, I need a way of logging what script used
sendmail to send out an email. I wrote a wrapper for sendmail in Perl
and it works fine for tracking CGI scripts, but I suspect it doesn't
work for PHP since I see empty log entries in my logs.

So, how does PHP actually use sendmail?

Are there any environment variables I can log?

I basically need to know what script is sending out emails - maybe there
is a better way of doing this that works for PHP *and* other scripting
languages (perl)?

Grateful for any ideas

Is there an added benefit to this?

I implemented this somewhere thinking it was a more elegant solution,
assuming there were other added benefits to this approach, but I'm now being
asked what those are and am falling short on my googling..

To anyone who was following:

I ran with this solution in development and found it to be smooth (and in
compliance with my 'SQL-side' laurels).

However, once I imported some 100k+ records (all containing large HTML
blobs), the memory on the SQL server would max out.  I did add a join to the
query (300+ records), but that was fine during initial development -- I
found that sum(1) would exponentially tax the memory allocated to MySQL.

Ended up storing results in a multi-dimensional array and looping through
that.

haha never execute a tactic without a defined objective... if it has 
side effects that will come back to bite you ;-)
(in other words, don't rock the boat doh!)

What are the "added benefits" ?

- you look more like a Web2.0 app
- you make it easier for people who use search engines to find PHP 
materials (instead of  .php files)
- you make management wonder if you really are using java for web 
development like they think you should
- you are more "search engine friendly" by the 2004 definition

Seriously, how about:

- you establish the potential for long-lived URLs that survive a change 
in technology (weak excuse, not likely, but theoretically ok)
- you are slightly more search engine friendly
- your URLs are slightly more user friendly, more likely to get 
remembered, bookmarked, etc.
- friendlier URLs are more likely to get backlinks, and deep backlinks 
are more desireable than root backlinks
- it leaves more room for innovation down the road (ties into the first 
reason on this list...long-lived URLs)

Hope that helps a little.

Hello everyone.  

I apologize beforehand for using this list for this purpose, I wouldn't normally do it, but please know I need your help.

I'm looking for an organization, company or freelance team, that is interested in hiring a hard working employee.  I possess professional qualities and work ethic that demonstrate commitment to my work and employer.  My diligence and dedication to Web projects provide top quality results.  I am a team worker, have good organizational skills, artistically inclined, and willing to work many hours including weekends.

I am using this list because my English in not yet quiet fluent, and puts me at a disadvantage when looking for work.  In some instances I am competing with people that have less experience than me, but have the upper hand because they dominate perfectly the language.  

In a recent internship at the World Federalist Movement, I worked doing the website programming and design.  For the work-in-progress please see www.iccnow.org.  This organization would also serve as a job reference as they are available to answer any questions regarding my work.

Thank you for taking the time to read my petition.  To contact me please send a message directly to my email, I wouldn't like to burden this list with responses to this message.

With much appreciation.

See the sendmail_path in php.ini.  You can use your existing logger.

For those not aware of this possibility, see

I thought this was a great book. I read it as I was transitioning from
procedural programming in PHP4 to PHP5/OOP and it hit the spot for me.

Also, I felt the 'Pro PHP Security' book mentioned earlier was great as
well. Very comprehensive and provides a lot of great explanations of options
and pros/cons of different approaches.

Message-ID: <003c01c64c37$43e9dcf0$0aa8a8c0@cliff>

I am bringing up a new server and received the following errors when
trying to send mail. Do I just have a php.ini include path problem? It
looks like PEAR landed in a strange location. Where do you put PEAR
files?
 
Wait a minute -- I think I have two PEAR install on this machine. 
(include_path='.:/usr/local/Zend/Core/share/pear:/var/tmp/php-root/usr/s
hare/pear') 
Time for more digging...

Noone wearing their sys admin hat today?

OTOH, making your web server parse all files as PHP will likely increase 
the load...

Normally it would fall into the location of where it was specified in  
your ./configure when you built php ...

./configure --with-pear=/my/pear/location

For example on my box is /usr/lib/php

Id try running 'pear install Net_SMTP' or 'pear upgrade Net_SMTP' ...

The one puzzling thing for me is why you would have 2 PEAR locations  
here, for example why Zend/Core would need its own setup, Id think it  
would be best to have a single location in your include_path and  
*before* any additional framework setups.

The first build came from an rpm of unknown origin. That threw PEAR into
a strange directory. Looks like ZendCore does its own PEAR install. Need
to do a bit of research to see if it can be changed, but I assume its
"pre-built"
 
Pear install is next on the list. And working on using SendMail too.

Yeah I don't think you can get away with multiple PEAR  
directories ... if you type "pear config-show" on the command line  
you should have where your packages should eventually end up.  The  
main problem is if you do a package update you would have out-of-sync  
items causing headaches ... + Id be 100% sure that ZendCore would be  
using the same PEAR repository as the rest of the world.

ZendCore appears to be great. I swear by Zend Studio so I'm not
surprised.

 From my own experience (and im not sure how much of this has  
changed) but the main problem w/ installing from RPMs and pre-built  
packages is that they seem to always try to make guesses on where you  
have other stuff installed and when you deal w/ a scripting language  
that has so many extensions such as PHP you don't get flexibility  
from installing it as is.  On the flip side you get this feeling of  
safeness that you can't and haven't screwed anything up :-)

Either way Id say one of the better joys in learning Linux is  
learning to configure and compile the source on your own to get what  
you need out of PHP.  Granted it is more time to invest but at least  
you know you have your own setup, know where things are, and when in  
doubt have a phpinfo() to come back to.

Finding time in a busy day .. well that's another deal :-)

Hey guys,

I have a database of vendors, each have different days and times they are
open from.

now what i need to do is this

check to see if the vendor is open at the current time, if not i need to
check the next day, then the next, etc..

I have some simple code that is not in working form, that is this


                            $time = '';
                            $day = date('w');
                            $days = 1;

                            // getLeadTime() returns a time in minutes,
converting to seconds so we can add it to the timestamp.
                            $leadTime = 60 * $location->getLeadTime();

                            $i = $day;
                            while($i <= 6) {
                                $curday = $day + $i;
                                if($curday == 7) {
                                    $i = 0;
                                    $curday = 6;
                                }
                                // getOpenTime() returns a string such as
10:00:00 or 23:30:00
                                $timeStr = $location->getOpenTime($curday);
                                // if $timStr is = 00:00:00 then it needs to
continue on to the next loop
                                if($timeStr == '00:00:00') {
                                    $i++;
                                    $days++;
                                    continue;
                                }
                            }
                            // now we need to get the timestamp, this is
where the strtotime converts the string from getOpenTime to a timestamp and
we add the leadTime
                            $vendorOpenTime =
strtotime($location->getOpenTime($day + $days)) + $leadTime;

Now the above code works fine if they are closed on Monday and not open
again until Thursday, the trouble lies in being closed Sat and Sun, it
doesnt flip over to Monday.  it just says get it delivered today, even if
they are closed the current day.

Anyone who can help me with this i would appreciate it, i wouldnt even mind
paying someone to help me nail this logic :D  I have spent pretty much about
5 hours on this and i think i just need another brain to pick at it :)

Thanks,

Your issue lies here I believe:

 if($curday == 7) {
                                    $i = 0; 
                                    $curday = 6;
                                }
you're resetting curday instead od $day.
For above it you're assigning

$curday = $day + $i

so it's either pointless, or it's broke.

I'm a little confused as to what you're doing here:

$i = $day;
$curday = $day + $i;
if($curday == 7) {
       $i = 0;
       $curday = 6;
}

If the current day is Saturday, then the $day variable will hold 6 (I
believe).

You're then saying that $curday has a value of 12, (because you're adding
$i, which has an initial value of 6), which shouldn't happen (I don't think
at least), which in effect would bypass the check if $curday is 7.

Hope that helps shed some light on why the code is acting weird.

hmm.. I didn't think he asked for reasons why *not* to do it, did he?

As for increased load, theoretically yes. Ever test it? It depends on 
how many non-php files your web server is serving up, right? How about 
none? How about when you separate display from code? With templates? 
Which templating system? Oh, that's right.. PHP *is* a templating 
system. So then they are all .php files again??

It all depends on how you use it, right?

I've used PEAR only.  My original options were a) roll-my-own, b) learn 
to love PEAR Mail or c) learn to love something else.

Overall PEAR packages are stable and consistent and have a nice 
installation system, so putting the time into b) seemed worth it.  I'm 
now using PEAR mail, mail_mime, mail_imapv2 and am happy with them all, 
they "just work".

My only possible gripe is that all you can count on for docs is a class 
reference.  This is great, but it would really be nirvana if PEAR 
standards required at least one comprehensive example and walk-through 
as part of the docs.

Thanks -- well said. Actually PEAR Mail is fairly well documented and
there are a bunch of tutorials. Its some of the other PEAR packages that
drive me crazy -- and drive me away -- due to the lack of documentation.

I have long been a fan of phpmailer, however at present I cannot
recommend it due to bugs in both the 1.72 and 1.73 releases.

It does appear that Brent and Patrice are working on these issues, and
hopefully there will be a new version out soon.

The almighty list:

I am struggling with including a field returned from the subselect in  
the WHERE clause of the parent SELECT.  I keep on getting an error  
that the field is unknown:

"Unknown column 'pt_prgm_term_overall_end_date' in 'where clause'"

I have seen that this is a bug in previous versions of MySQL, but I  
am using 4.1.18 and it was to have been fixed by this version, 4.1.16  
I believe.

Here is the SQL below.  I have bolded the field in question [for  
those not using Pine :-)].  I have tried putting the restriction in  
the subselect's WHERE clause, but that simply returns all rows with  
the pt_prgm_term_overall_end_date blank if not matching '2007-04-30'

SELECT DISTINCT a.pt_prgm_id,
	a.user_id,
	b.pt_lname,
	b.pt_fname,
	(SELECT pt_prgm_term_start_date FROM carl_pt_prgm_term
		WHERE user_id = a.user_id AND pt_prgm_id = a.pt_prgm_id
		ORDER BY pt_prgm_term_start_date ASC LIMIT 1)
		AS pt_prgm_term_overall_start_date,			
	(SELECT pt_prgm_term_end_date FROM carl_pt_prgm_term
		WHERE user_id = a.user_id AND pt_prgm_id = a.pt_prgm_id
		ORDER BY pt_prgm_term_end_date DESC LIMIT 1)
		AS pt_prgm_term_overall_end_date						
FROM (carl_pt_prgm AS a, carl_pt AS b)
WHERE b.user_id = a.user_id
	AND a.prgm_id = 6
	AND a.pt_prgm_status_id = 'A'
	AND pt_prgm_term_overall_end_date = '2007-04-30'

My guess ...

It looks like you are either not included the actual table it's being  
called from in your FROM clause, if I read it right, you have:

FROM (carl_pt_prgm AS a, carl_pt AS b)

Try adding FROM (carl_pt_prgm AS a, carl_pt AS b, carl_pt_prgm_term  
AS c)

And c.pt_prgm_term_overall_end_date

See if that works ... I think your overall statement is missing thus  
why the column can't be found.

I *believe* that the "where" is applied first and therefore your
pt_prgm_term_overall_end_date would not have any meaning when
execution begins.

This seems to confirm the same and suggests a strategy:

Can't do it.  No aliases in WHERE statement.  Put it in HAVING instead, and 
it will work.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/problems-with-alias.html

Think of it this way: when it does the WHERE, it's trying to figure out 
what rows should be included in the results - a first stab at the problem.  
It hasn't even looked at the SELECT part of the statement yet - once it 
figures out what rows should be included overall, then it'll take a look 
at the SELECT fields to decide which columns from those rows it needs.  
And THEN, only then, will it look at the HAVING section - a last stab at 
winnowing the result set.

So: if you want to eliminate unwanted results early (to make queries 
quicker), put the condition early in the WHERE clause.  If you want to 
eliminate unwanted results late (because you're doing something tricksy), 
put it in the HAVING clause.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Pear DB in another class
Message-ID: <AEB94730-8D25-4CB7-8400-0AEB8D038618@electronink.com>

Is it possible to use Pear DB in a class that returns a database  
handle that I can then run queries with.

I think it should look something like this

== myDb.php ==

require_once 'DB.php';

class myDb extends DB {

	function myDb(){

		$dsn = "mysqli://user:pass at localhost/db";
		$db = DB::connect();

	}
}


===EOF===

I can do an include that generates a handle but thought there would  
be a way to write a class that could grab the config info and connect().

Thanks,
	Russ

the most logical reason not to do it is!!!

Vulnerabilities,
it's not a matter of making things faster, b/c it won't, I've tried, but
in actuality you create excessive opportunities for  security breaches,
why on earth would you want to make your life harder. on that note, if
you don't want people to see .php, why don't you setup everything to be
mapped by a mod_rewrite system, makes more sense, but really, i still
don't get why you'd even want to care about .php, it works, now if we're
talking SEO, then this conversation will have to look at quite a few
other things. but for general serving of pages, the .php or .phtml as it
used to be worked to prevent your webserver from doing extra work and
also to prevent uploaded files from being used as PHP scripts.

Can you substantiate that claim? My web sites don't use file extensions, 
but I doubt you can convince me that this increases my security risk.

I know little to nothing about SEO - my decision is based on my opinion 
that URLs are basically friendly APIs for the average person. Things 
like file extensions and underscores don't seem very friendly.

I appreciate this discussion. It's good stuff. I'd like to see more of it.

There are so many ways to avoid using file extensions... Maybe it's

 www.site.tld/nicename causes Apache to run /nicename/index.php
or
 www.site.tld/nicename causes Apache to run /nicename/index.html (which 
is a PHP script, or maybe not)
or
 www.site.tld/nicename is merely a referrer reference because PHP.ini 
runs a (PHP script) controller every time
or
 www.site.tld/nicename causes Apache to run /nicename (a PHP script with 
no extension)
or
 www.ste.tld/nicename causes Apache to run redirect to 
/nicename/controller.php via a rewrite rule

Each has performance issues, security issues, etc. How can one generalize?

Chris chooses to accommodate the user, and handles the security and 
performance issues. Isn't that how we all have to do it? Choose a 
strategy and cover the bases?

For what its worth....

We spent some time agonizing over this issue.  We were already  
spending time stripping out the apache server token, setting  
expose_php=off, etc to minimize the amount of information about our  
site we were exposing.  Advertising the fact that we were using php  
by including the .php seemed to defeat all of these efforts.  We  
thought about using rewrite,  but found that it can make debugging a  
nightmare.  We also investigated using a controller script that  
routed paths to the correct php code.  While this optioned looked  
like the best for a variety of reason (error tracking, logging, etc)  
we decided against it because of the amount of rewriting we would  
have to do. In the end we decided to just drop the .php extension.

If you are concerned about performance when serving static content  
then I would suggest serving content with a separate http server.  In  
my case I use apache to serve up the php scripts and everything  
static is served with a lightweight http server like tux.   The  
lightweight server can still run on the same machine, either by using  
a virtual ip or a different port number.

As far as speed goes,  the amount of time to call a script  with or  
without the file extension is fairly small.  In deciding whether to  
use file extensions or not we used ab to benchmark the two:

Without .php extension:   22.46 requests per second,  44.53  ms per  
request
With .php extension:   22.54 requests per second,  44.36 ms per request

It was a small enough difference not to matter to us.  That being  
said,  other problems on your server such as slow harddrives  are  
going to amplify that difference some.  That being said,  there are  
much more import areas to focus on if you need to make things  
faster.   For example,  optimizing the php/apache binary, moving our  
content to a ram disk and installing an opcode cache such as apc, the  
above benchmark jumped to 153 requests per second (6.53 ms per request).

Hi,

   I have the file one.php (opened in a browser) with
a link to the page two.php. This is basically a lookup
php which retreives ID for my one.php. two.php has
some checkboxes for ID. The checked value is being
passed onto one.php. but this opens a new one.php
instead of passing it to the already opened window of
one.php. How can I prevent a new one.php being opened?


Pleasseeeeeeeeee help me.

Thanks,

well, I'm not sure what Dan was thinking, but my first reaction to
"parse every file as php" was to think of an image containing the string
'<?', text files containing sample code, etc, and then the obvious
implications of accepting any content files from third parties anywhere.
The only way I know of to convince apache to do that is ForceType, which
could be safe if it was deployed carefully, sure, but I agree it would
introduce a risk.  I also think it's a really ugly way to do it, whether
there's a security risk or not (and I'm pretty sure nobody said they
were doing it that way anyway), but that's a matter of opinion

I've been experimenting with doing this for one small site using
RewriteRules in an .htaccess file: 

RewriteRule ^account$               account.php [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^account/edit$          account.php?action=edit [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^catalog/recent$        catalog.php?filter=recent [NC,L]

And I've been pretty happy with the friendliness of it.  Yes, it is a huge
headache to debug, and yes, using .htaccess files & RewriteRules will slow
apache down a bit, but we don't mind.  We didn't have any motive other
than the user-friendliness one

PHP doesn't know or care about browser windows. It is the browser 
that is interpreting the HTML that the PHP script sends as to what to do.

What do you mean by a new window?

Please post some code showing us how scripts one & two are linked and 
pass information.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] GD imagettftext font problem
Message-ID: <005301c64d31$28ce9000$0aa8a8c0@cliff>

I am trying to build a graph and get the following error on my new Linux
server: 

ERRNO: 2 
TEXT: imagettftext() [function.imagettftext]: Could not find/open font 

This is the output of phpinfo:
GD Support enabled 
GD Version bundled (2.0.28 compatible) 
FreeType Support enabled 
FreeType Linkage with freetype 
FreeType Version 2.1.9 
T1Lib Support enabled 
GIF Read Support enabled 
GIF Create Support enabled 
JPG Support enabled 
PNG Support enabled 
WBMP Support enabled 
XBM Support enabled

I assume my instal can't find the fonts. What path setting should I be
changing. What does the font file look like so I can see if it's
installed on the system?

Cliff

Thanks kenneth but can you elaborate a bit on this part? What is the 
ugly part... and what is unsafe about using ForceType? Thanks.

By new window, I mean it is not passing the values
from two.php to the already opened (parent) one.php,
but opening a new one.php with the selected values.

Message-ID: <0IWH00LNOZH3F022@vms046.mailsrvcs.net>

There seems to be a problem when trying to copy/paste a Word document into
TinyMCE that is running in a browser on a Mac. All of the formatting is
lost. (Of course...this works without a hitch in Windows.)

Anyone have a workaround for this problem?

Since PHP runs on the server, each time the script is invoked it is a 
new process. There is no continuity between runs of the scripts 
unless you provide some via sessions or cookies or some other method 
of saying "I've been here before".

By the time script two runs, the original script one is no longer 
running, so it can't be returned to.

Well, the ugliness is my totally subjective response to the idea of
ForceType in the first place

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#forcetype

What I think the added risk would be, if you were parsing all files as
php, all it takes is the chance that some binary file contained the
string '<?' (or '<?php' if short tags is off) to trigger an error -- not
a very threatening error, but still an error.  Taken further, if you
accept any content from third parties, there is the possibility that
they've altered the content to run whatever command they wanted as your
apache user, maybe by putting code in the id3 comment of an mp3 file, or
altering a .gif or .zip file with a hex editor ... right?? 

unless I'm way off...

Actually, now that I read the link I looked up for you, I see there is
also DefaultType, which respects the other types apache knows about.
That looks a lot better, but you still have to be careful that apache
knows about everything found in your DocumentRoot.

If that doesn't work they are just plain lying to you!

Maintain state with sessions

http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php

or have two.php be a popup opened by one.php and use javascript's
window.opener to alter the content of one.php, but that can be a real
pain.

The 7th parameter (yes 7 of 8) to imagettftext() is 'The path to the
TrueType font you wish to use', look for any files on your machine
ending with the .ttf extension, those are the font files. Either
supply the full path to the file you want to use, or make your life
easier by copying that file into the same directory as the code.

Now I understand, thanks. I see "no file extensions in URLs" and "parse

Sure, so do I.  What was said upthread exactly was:

Cliff:

Try the following to test stuff:

<?php
Header ("Content-type: image/gif");
$im = imagecreate (150, 150);
$background = ImageColorAllocate ($im, 238, 238, 238);
$text_color = ImageColorAllocate ($im, 00, 51, 102);	//#036 00 33 66 HEX
ImageTTFText ($im, 20, 45, 30, 130, $text_color, "arial.ttf",
"Hello World...");
ImageGif ($im);
ImageDestroy ($im);
?>

You can get arial.tiff (along with other fonts) at:

thanks for clarifying.

Accepting user uploads is an application-specific situation and so needs 
to be handled regardless IMHO. Good to be aware that files might be 
parsed, just as they may be echoed.

Personally I am fond of explicit declarations in most code, so I would 
not normally parse every file, but often parse all .html as php.

I find that for published static websites Forcetype is faster than a PHP 
controller, and easy to administer.

If you are lucky enough to have a dedicated server with
root access and thus have control over the Apache
configuration file, a technique that I use avoids use of
.htaccess files, mod_rewrite, or blanket interpretation of
all files as PHP. Simply create a Directory container for
all the files you want to pass to PHP that will not have an
extension:

<Directory /var/www/sites/mysite.com/docroot/folder>
 <FilesMatch "^(page1|page2|page3)$">
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
 </FilesMatch>
</Directory>

now:

mysite.com/folder/page1 (and so on)

will all run under PHP. If you want to create an entire
folder full of these, then omit the <FilesMatch> directive,
but be careful about storing non-PHP files in the same
place.

The current exam covers PHP 4. A PHP 5 exam is currently being written 
and should be published this summer.

Thanks to all for the help. Here's a summary of what I did:

1. I installed FreeType: http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index2.html
      FreeType Jam did not work, but the standard Make did work.
2. I discovered that FreeType <> fonts. I thought that was the point!
3. I downloaded Arial.ttf as suggested by Tedd from the URL below.
4. I put the font in my html docroot for now -- simple, as suggested by
Jeff.
5. I renamed Arial.ttf to arial.ttf to deal with the joy of case
sensitivity.

This test script from Tedd worked beautifully.

<?php
Header ("Content-type: image/gif");
$im = imagecreate (150, 150);
$background = ImageColorAllocate ($im, 238, 238, 238);
$text_color = ImageColorAllocate ($im, 00, 51, 102);	//#036 00 33 66
HEX
ImageTTFText ($im, 20, 45, 30, 130, $text_color, "arial.ttf", "Hello
World...");
ImageGif ($im);
ImageDestroy ($im);
?>

You can get arial.tiff (along with other fonts) at:

Of course, on a shared web host, the performance hit would probably be 
much greater.

Why?

Under the traditional setup, Apache knows a file needs to be passed to 
mod_php because its has been told that they are denoted by a .php 
extension. If you take that away then you, in effect, are telling Apache 
to assume *all* files are PHP files...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] logwatch "2 200 responses" issue
Message-ID: <4421862F.7010409@jiffycomp.com>

This is php-related in that lots of php-based web applications (more 
than one wiki, drupal, mambo & maybe joomla) share the issue. Although 
it may not really be a php problem. I've also seen it in htdig, the open 
source web indexing/searching tool. Has anybody seen it & dealt with it?

Here's the issue. Logwatch, which I have installed on some CentOS 4.2 
and Fedora Core 3 & 4 servers that I help out with, reports on many 
funny log entries. It's a great example of how Unix/Linux admin has 
gotten lots better since I started out. Among the entries it likes to 
keep me informed of is this http response code issue, generated by a 
chat module in drupal:

-------
A total of 11934 unidentified 'other' records logged
   with response code(s)
  GET /chatbox/text?nickname=jtrant&limit=30&lastrefresh=1142823531 
HTTP/1.1 with response code(s) 2 200 responses
  GET /chatbox/nicklist&forcerefresh=9317 HTTP/1.1 with response code(s) 
2 200 responses
--------

The problem is the "2 200 responses." Is that one page returning two 
success codes? I don't really know where it comes from. Anyway, I've 
seen this before, but when it goes on for 12000 messages, the logwatch 
reports are too big and too hard to read.

According to some googling I've done, one may edit logwatch's http 
script and tell it to filter using some other method. But that sounds 
hard (an endless road of modifying the script every time a new app comes 
out?) and I have a feeling this is not really logwatch's fault--where 
does that funny http response code come from, and why is it getting more 
and more common? On this page

https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-December/msg05044.html

someone attempts an explanation, but it doesn't sound realistic to me 
(unless I just don't understand what he means).

Thanks,
Matt

That's quite a leap. :-)

I don't use file extensions in my URLs out of personal preference, and I 
certainly don't tell Apache to treat all files as PHP.

John mentioned a few different ways to do this. You should read his email.

In theory it means two HTTP 200 responses. They aren't "funny" -- the
200 response code means a successful request.
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html

In my opinion, the reporting of HTTP 200 responses is a bug -- why
does any admin care about successful responses? I emailed the logwatch
authors about this in January but got no response. I even tried
hacking the script myself, but I wasn't successful.

If you come up with a solution, please let me know.

This is my last attempt to be helpful. I don't have time to waste on 
pointless debates.

Hello all.

Chris, and how can i do this? (I don't use file extensions in my URLs out of
personal preference, and I
certainly don't tell Apache to treat all files as PHP.)

Thanks.

for Ajai & Adler, 

mod_rewrite is another way.  here's more of my example from yesterday
(from an .htaccess file) 

note RewriteLog cannot be set from .htaccess files, so you might have to
develop your rules locally, on a server you control, and only upload
them to your hosted account after they work. 

# ======================================================================
# RewriteRules to support old-style and friendly URLs
# ======================================================================
# *** For debugging set RewriteLog in httpd.conf *** 
#
RewriteEngine On
#
#                    F I N A L   R E Q U E S T S
#
# these are requests for the actual files on disk; stop processing.
#
RewriteRule ^catalog.php$               - [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^account.php$               - [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^index.php                  - [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^search.php                 - [NC,L]
#
#                          O L D   U R L S
#
# add support for URLs from old version of site, to avoid breaking
# bookmarks/links/caches.  The redirects will indicate to the user that
# the correct URL has changed (due to [R])
#
# index.php is no longer the artist search page
RewriteRule ^index.php?selection=ARTS   catalog/artists [NC,R,L]
RewriteRule ^index.php?selection=(.*)   catalog/artists/$1 [NC,R,L]
# former by-name searches
RewriteRule ^index.php?whomlab=(.*)     catalog/label/$1 [NC,R,L]
RewriteRule ^index.php?whomart=(.*)     catalog/artist/$1 [NC,R,L]
#
#                      F R I E N D L Y   U R L S
#
# (note we are intentionally not using the [R] flag here)
# 
RewriteRule ^account$                   account.php [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^account/edit$              account.php?action=edit [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^catalog/recent$            catalog.php?filter=recent [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^catalog/artists$           catalog.php?list=artists [NC,L]
# catalog/artist/dead+c -> catalog.php?filter=artist&name=dead+c
RewriteRule ^catalog/artist/(.*)$       catalog.php?filter=artist&name=$1 [NC,L]

Things Im really puzzled by are why (even by choice) the template

Seems like repeating work if you ask me ... any thoughts?

I'm going to be lazy, and re-post (in entirety) my response to a  
similar question on the Zend Framework list.  Hope this helps.  :-)

There are literally dozens of template solutions in userland; each of  
them meets specific needs and desires, and none of them is really  
compatible with the others from the controller's point of view.

The internal debates at Zend on what template system to use were  
never resolved successfully; there are those at Zend who *love*  
PHPLIB templates as the "one true way".  There are others who think  
Smarty is the end-all be-all of templates.  Then there are the PEAR  
template categories:  Flexy, IT, etc et al ad nauseum.

So which of these techniques should Zend adopt as the blessed  
system?  The answer is: none.  Zend picked the simplest thing that  
could possibly work with all of the PHP template systems in  
userland:  PHP itself.

Thus, Zend_View exists not as a template system, but as a standard  
way for the business logic to hand over control to presentation  
logic.  Within the presentation logic encapsulated by Zend_View, you  
are free to do as you wish.

As you say, some developer/designer teams need an extra layer of  
intermediation or simplified markup.  In these cases, your Zend_View  
scripts should activate the template engine of your choice,  
manipulate it as you wish, and then have the engine generate the  
output.  To illustrate, here are two flavors of a view script, one  
using plain PHP, and the other using PHPLIB templates.

http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.scripts.html

http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/ 
zend.view.scripts.html#zend.view.scripts.templates

Note that the controller doesn't need to know anything about the view  
in these cases; it just gives the view its variables, and then the  
view script takes care of everything else.  This is what Zend means  
when they say that Zend_View is template-system agnostic; the system  
works for Smarty, PHPLIB, and everything else out there.

Concrete examples are always helpful. Thanks Ken for the code.

On the other hand, you really need to "see" the part in Ken's code where 
he states the specific objective of his rewrite rule sets.

One section says "final requests" and it stops the filtering...those are 
allowed through as-is. This section comes first. See the beginnings of a 
maintenance problem with this approach?

One section says "old URLs"  -- the objective is to rewrite incoming 
obsolete URLs to their proper content. GIVEN THAT SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE, 
the rulesets are created and tested. Should they send 301's or 302's? 
How long will they exists? Will they ever expire? If so, when were they 
added?

One section says "friendly URLs"... the goal is to make them "memorable" 
or "spider-friendly" or whatever (I am guessing). See how they re-write 
to a script with a parameter set? Se ethe maintenance nightmare 
developing here?

As I recall ken commented earlier about how high maintenance this 
appraoch can be. It is not only application specific, but *platform* 
specific. PHP coder has to play Apache admin, and the conf has to be 
kept updated with the code.

If you want to see a modern approach to this look at WordPress2. The 
rewrite system  grew so complex and is autogenerated (regenerated) and 
cannot really be hand edited or "enhanced" without first earning a 
Master's degree in WordPress Rewriting.

Sure, but two or more responses for one request is funny. (If that's 
what is really happening here--I don't really understand it.)

So I suppose I shouldn't have much hope that he'll write me back either. 
But it's heartening to know I'm not the only one who cares!

Someone on another list suggested this is in the 
/path/to/logwatch/conf/services/http.conf:

*Remove = "text to match in lines to remove before processing"

But I can't find any documentation of that, in either the man page or 
the docs on logwatch.org. So I tried it, but I think it's equally as 
likely that it will break logwatch as that it will work. I'll know by 
tomorrow & will post to let you know.

Thanks!

a hard sell to convince me to re-write the exam.

Hi,
I need an example of javascript triggering an MySQL query through PHP.
What for?
It will be a cascading javascript menu where option 2 is retrieved from the
database according to the first selection and so on.
In all it will be a 4 level menu.
Any pointers/hints/examples would come in handy.

It really depends on the complexity and size of the dataset - if you can
pre-fetch the entire range of options then you could store the values in
javascript arrays and/or a XML object, in either case using PHP as the
conduit to the database and to create the XML or javascript data.

If you really need to do a database query for each menu level, you'll need
to use javascript to get the data via a XMLHTTP request or similar method
and again use PHP to do the database call and data formatting on the fly.
And while you can use javascript to do all this without reloading the page,
you will almost certainly have latency issues trying to keep up with
mouseover interactions -- if that is how you intend the menu to work. The
more you can do asynchronously, the better (at least in terms of user
experience).

If you look at this particular tabbed menu interface project within this
AJAX site:
http://www.crackajax.net/tabs.php
 
..you can get a real fast look at using AJAX (where any onmouseover or
onclick event, etc. can trigger a JavaScript call to a PHP 
script that taps the database and returns the info to the AJAX interface
back to the HTML page) without a page reload. Smooth.
 
I think it might very nearly do exactly what you want.
 
Plus, this particular AJAX formulation has the smallest JavaScript scripting
footprint I have seen.

[Not sure if this got posted so...I'm resending to the "list." - Jeff]


Well...someone's lying because it doesn't work. 

My client tried this two different ways.

1. Using Word and FF on a Mac, when he did the copy/paste, none of the
formatting was retained (except for paragraph breaks).

2. When using Safari instead of FF, it seemed to take the formatting but on
submitting the form...it dropped all of the information (which is in the
form's textarea) so that the PHP script sees a completely empty field.

Perhaps there is something in the TinyMCE JavaScript that needs to be
removed?

And further, I have successfully integrated a similar small-footprint AJAX
project from crackajax.com into a client's Admin area where 
they have the opportunity to search their entire image collection basically
in realtime by simply starting to type picture names into an input field 
and matching picture names are promptly presented and refreshed in a nearby
div. The client and staff love this fast-acting tool because they have over
10,000 pictures 
in inventory.
 
Additionally, I am using the tabbed menu AJAX project in another current
prototype project needing a "current conditions" search interface.
 
I present this extra feedback to show that AJAX/PHP can be a simple.
elegant, very viable interface solution now.
 
Peter.

TinyMCE was working with Safari? That sounds like a lie...
I guess that's not a very helpful answer, though.

Id also recommend @ least taking a look at the following libraries  
which have seen to become the norm (albeit via Rails):

* Prototype (the base of all things good)
http://prototype.conio.net/

* Scriptaculous
http://script.aculo.us/

* Behaviour
http://bennolan.com/behaviour/

* event:Selectors
http://www.encytemedia.com/event-selectors/

* JQuery
http://jquery.com

I think as more people expand on the Prototype library you are able  
to perform remote queries pretty easily, if you combine all of these  
libraries you get a nice toolkit to do anything client-side you might  
need.

Id send you here for more info:

-1 for Trak[sic].

I think the advantage of Trac is that it combines everything in one package:
SVN repo browsing, issue tracking, milestones and a wiki.  So, it does carry
a lot of bang for the buck so to speak.  With one system, you've got a lot
less to maintain.

The problem with Trac is that it's not very good at any of them.  The wiki
is horrible... very picky and sometimes awkward with it's syntax, plus a
lack of features (eg. categories).
E.g.
1. this
1. is
1. a
1. numbered list
=This heading won't work=
= But this one will = (it's got spaces between the '=' and the text)

Mediawiki would be a much better wiki engine.

The svn browser can't handle large changesets properly (freezes)

cvsweb would probably be a better web repo browser.

The issue tracker is not something I'd want to make customer facing.  In
fact, it doesn't seem to be geared for both external and internal use.
(Unless by external you mean outside developers of your software.)

I'm still looking for a good issue tracker.  I'm glad to have come across
this thread so I can check some of the links provided.

Cheers,

Greg

Curious if any thought has been given in regards to recording the

that do not live in the new york area or are unable to attend the meetings?
I know the Atlanta-PHP group has been posting their meeting's podcast on 
their forum:

Thought it might be great for the community if we did the same.

Morgan,

Currently we post the MP3 recording of the meeting on the Presentations 
page. (Thanks Michael)  The link to the MP3 file can be found at the 
bottom of the summary of the presentations. We have not started to 
Podcast yet.  It might happen in the future.  As for web casting, there 
was a brief discussion about it but we have elected to forgo it for now..

http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/index.php

Look for the line that says, " Download MP3s: Part 1".

Thanks,

Not necessarily - you don't have to use Ajax in this case. As Alberto said
in the first reply to your post, you can embed a Javascript array (built by
PHP during the page request) that is embedded in the page source or is
included in a javascript file.  You can then use the values in this array to
populate your menu on the fly.  No need for asynchronous requests (Ajax).
Not that I don't like Ajax, but it is not necessarily the ideal solution in
this case - why grab the menu data from the database every time the user
mouses over or selects a parent category?  There is certain to be noticeable
latency every once in a while; in addition, this behavior wastes bandwidth
and server processing time.  If you were running a website that got a ton of
traffic, this would be a big no-no.

START:Another AJAX Moment

Of course, for most JS/DHTML menu systems one would populate JS arrays with
PHP and then drive the menus from the local array(s). 

On the other had if you are creating a volatile and extensive menu/dropdown
system such as of the style: Select Your Country>> Select Your State>>
Select Your City>> Select Your Zip>> Select Your Nearest Location -- then
using AJAX is a perfectly viable solution. Yes, AJAX will show some latency,
but it is much briefer than a whole page reload.

For further reference, the team at MSFT is building an AJAX SDK shipping
with Vista. 

Even further aside, it is only a vague impression of mine, but it appeared
to me that XML usage only really finally took off and started coming up into
common programming decision making after MSFT started integrating XML into
their product. 

So... using AJAX techniques in a project is not about a belief system, but
its about moving to provide immediacy to the end-user. 

Ultimately, the objective is that consumers spend less time at the computer
interfacing and more time benefiting from the result(s).

I don't really have any objection to your suggestion, exept for the 
"example". It seems to me (and yes, I have been wrong once before), that 
trendy things like AJAX tend to get used when a wee bit more thought 
might have revealed better, more efficient solutons. case in point:

yes, a tedious set of lookups like your example of

Select Your Country>> Select Your State>>
Select Your City>> Select Your Zip>> Select Your Nearest Location

would require a large database of support and therefore does seem to obviate the need for a huge data preload by running dynamic lookups via AJAX. 

However, why do we even need that tedious set of lookups? Your a-priori knowledge isn't being utilized. If the user knows ZIP, why ask for CITY STATE COUNTRY? If it's a shipping app, the prior stage might have cued the user to be prepared to enter a shipping destination. What % of visitors ship to a zip code outside of their IP-geo location? It might be way-small. When you think about it, how much info is already encoded in the ZIP code anyway? Certainly region is represented in the first two numerals of ZIP... a state or two of preload maybe?

I agree there is a place for AJAX, but I don't agree that the majority 
of coders out there are thinking about the application of their code 
nearly as much as they are thinking about their own tech careers when 
they choose things like AJAX.

There has been some debate n NYPHP in the past about using "event" as a 
basic data structure for websites. For example, given an event data 
construct (what, when,where,whom,about/related to, comments about, etc) 
one could build many common MVC websites.

I'd like to bake some of that bread right now so I am looking for some 
starter dough.... has anyone worked with a base LAMP setup for events 
management worthy of development?

Some of what I have noted thus far:

A "calendar" is an interface to such a database, but existing "Calendar" 
systems  seems so UI-centric and often have pretty poor back end 
infrastructure. Sorry, but I am one of those who believe you can skin 
anything once it's well-designed, so I want the solid backend design first.

CMS's approach event management as a necessary feature, but seem to 
spend more time on the integration of the Calendar UI with the CMS than 
an events database structure. I am loathe to adapt a CMS just to get 
access to a feature given secondary imortance by the core developers - 
too much baggage.

The market opportunity for almost *any* true events management system is 
tremendous, so once a project puts a niche label onto itself the UI and 
application-specific aspects overwhelm the value of the backend and, 
well, we get YAUWTAINOASI (yet another unfinished Web Two application in 
need of a solid infrastructure). Perhaps I am being too cynical ;-)

Anyway comments and suggestions about an events-driven database 
infrastructure very much appreciated.

Some observations:

"When" is typically two values, start and end. To find the events in a
given month, you look up all the events that start and/or end within
the month, or that start before and end after the month.

But... recurring events are a difficult problem with this model. You
can insert all the instances of a recurring event for the next 5
years, and group them together so they can be changed as a group. It
is not so difficult to imagine a situation where that gets really
ugly.

Instead, you can build a cron-style system in which every event is a
recurring event (even if it only occurs once). In this case, "when" is
a set of values: minute, hour, day of month, month, year, day of week
and duration. That makes managing recurring events a snap (change one
record) but it makes lookup quite a bit more complicated.

And let us not forget timezones and daylight savings time, which, when
combined with the intricacies of rendering multi-day events on a
month-view calendar, will make grown men weep.
http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/29/daylight_saving_ends.html

I wonder why there aren't more products out there that get this right?

Actually, isn't "when" really just one value - offset from defined zero? 
"duration" is a second attribute of the event.  And daylight savings etc 
are just UI considerations... localization details even. Complications 
of the sort you describe arise in the face of "expectations" for the app 
(be it calendar or schedule, etc). The data is still start, duration, 
venue, etc.

I would support the app's expectations with tables derived from the 
data....often okay to regenerate periodically as opposed to real-time.

I am thinking I can do a helluvalot with this generalized data model. Am 
I crazy??

And isn't recurring just a flag? The presentation or business layer can see if a recurring event falls into a 
calendar timframe by doing some simple math.

How does it "recur". Every day, every other day, every Monday and
Wednesday, on the 5th of every month, on the 4th Tuesday of every
month, on the last day of the month, every 45 days, quarterly,
annually?

The way I always handled occurance was to have two fields in the database, a
key (usually an integer), and a value, which I stored as a string.

I then had a function which took an event and a day in, and checked the
events occurance key / value to see if it applied for that day, and returned
either true or false.

I doubt this is the most efficient way, but it works for me.

Yeah, well let's not go there because some folks even call it recurrence 
when it relies on a fixed day of the week but a count of week into the 
month (like "last Tuesday of every month"). Such moronic scheduling 
should be criminal ;-)

I agree that recurrence should be handled in the presentation layer, 
provided the data is in. but what data? Depends on type of recurrence, 
which is where the business layer interferes with the data layer anyway. 
those damn humans think "every other wednesday" is recurrence.... duh. 
It's really "every other day that has already been assigned the label 
"Wednesday" and that works just fine using the flag approach, right?

I'd appreciate an example of that 'simple math' cliff? Might make it 
clearer what you mean.

Well, simple might have been a stretch. And I agree putting the actual
"recurrence extraction" in the business or presentation layer does make
sense. But duplicating events in the database still doesn't make sense
to me unless you need to "spawn" a change.

Although I haven't worked it out, I still believe a primary recurrence
type field makes sense such as:
1. Recurrence method: (daily, weekly, monthly, first Tuesday, 2nd Blue
moon, etc.)
2. Start date
3. Duration or end date
4. Numeric field (21st, 2nd, 4th, etc.)
3. other fields necessary for the recurrence method

Now capturing the rigorous publishing schedule for my Semiconductor
Times newsletter could be a challenge. The algorithm is very simple --
the first Friday of each month unless the first day of the month is
pretty darn close to the preceding Friday (like this coming April
issue), whereupon I will publish sometime between the two dates or
perhaps by the preceding Friday. Capture that!

Let's say I want to render all of the events on a particular date:
April 1, 2006, a Saturday. There is an event on January 18, 2003 (also
a Saturday) which is set to recur every two weeks... which translates
in this case to "odd Saturdays". Okay, I see how that would work.

For any given day you generate a list of all the possible matches
(April 1, 2006 is a Saturday, an odd Saturday, first Saturday, first
of the month, etc), and then SELECT against those matches to find the
events that apply.

And multi-day events would just work, as long as you enforce a maximum
duration, right? If events can last up to 5 days, you have to start
your lookups 5 days before the month in question in order to capture
recurring events that started before, but end during the month.

To be truly useful you need to have an override mechanism -- one time
events that mask out properties on a recurring event. We have a
monthly meeting the recurs on 4th Tuesdays, but each instance of that
event has a different "who" and "what". That seems like the easy part.
A truly excellent implementation would even allow you to push or pull
the start date, so that Cliff could reschedule the publication of his
newsletter.

You might also want an event log to track events that have actually
happened, so that when a recurring event is updated to reflect a new
reality, it doesn't rewrite history.

John, your taxonomy idea is interesting (fetch events tagged
"Wednesdays") and essentially the same as the "key/value" approach
Brian described. If you're using a system that has robust tagging
(like Ning) it might save some time.

Sorry, just thinking about this, I think it's fair to point out that
this is 30+ queries to render a month view, versus a system that
doesn't allow recurring events and can pull all of the events that
appear in a month with a single query.

It's not that bad a thing, though. "I can do recurring events, but
it'll cost ya."  ;-)

Actually, because when I created these websites with events, I was dealing
with an individual's events, and on the large scale, any one user most
likely won't have an overwhelming amount of events.  So each time their
calendar was loaded, I grabbed all their events, and looped through them
(with some filters, like if it never recurred, and it didn't happen during
that month, I didn't need to grab that).

In addition to my key/value approach that I described earlier, it was just a
huge if / else if block, and if anyone has any suggestions on how to improve
that, I'd be very happy to hear.  Basically, right now it goes through the
events one at a time checking each day for each event.  For instance, if an
event is to happen once every month on the 29th, it would have a key of 1,
and a value of 29, and then if the event had the start time of "yyyy-mm-29",
it would return true for that event on that day.

I'm not ready to count queries.... I believe that's an artificial 
restraint that is really an accommodation of the business layer/logic. 
If we have good data, but the app needs a monthly calendar, doesn't that 
set a requirement for a subquery/temp table and then aren't there 
additional app-specific efficiencies likely to be available (generate 
monthly activity table for MAY; update if any MAY events changed, etc).

Perhaps this is exactly what I found distasteful about available 
"solutions"... they tied the business logic into the data storage too 
early in the game.

I'll grant that a robust technology for tagging might provide a 
convenient / efficient tool for managing event data, but I am not 
looking for that practical route (and don't want to do that research ;-)

I want to create a robust/effective tool for managing event data.... 
maybe tagging can be added later :-)

WARNING: Casual mentions of periodic functions and linear algebar 
enclosed. But the post starts with "free beer"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free beer on my deck at 8pm tonight. (really ;-)

My wife will tolerate the often-worse-than-public-restroom use until 
about 11pm, so let's set the event details:
Absolute time zero is right now (2:50pm PST)
Start:  8pm PST
End : 11pm PST

Event #2:  For those who can't fly out to the left coast in time, a 
mirror beer gathering on Hans K's deck in NJ starting at 10pm EST tonight.
Start:  10pm EST
End : 2am next day EST

Reduction handled by business logic/app layer:

Event1(Offset of Start)=310 (minutes from absolute zero)
Event1(Duration)=180
Event2(Offset of Start)=7hrs 10 min = 430 min
Event2(Duration)=180

*if* the time base has 10 minute time slices, then evID1 occupies [310:490]
and evID2 occupies [430:610] of the absolute_time_base.

abs_time[130] is associated with  evID1
abs_time[140] is associated with  evID1
abs_time[150] is associated with  evID1
.
.
.
abs_time[430] is associated with  evID1,evID2
abs_time[440] is associated with  evID1,evID2
.
.
.
abs_time[490] is associated with  evID1,evID2
abs_time[500] is associated with  evID2
.
.
.
abs_time[610] evID2
abs_time[620] NULL


Make mine weekly. Luckily, "weekly" is digital except for disturbances 
(like DST). If I assume "disturbances" are processed against the 
time_base locally, then, all I need to do is preset the busy_times as
(7 days = 7 x 24 x 60 = 10080 minutes) so
130+10080=10210
10210+10080=20290
20290+10080=30370 etc

abs_time[10210] evID1
...
abs_time[10210=180] evID1

abs_time[20290] evID1
...
abs_time[20290+180] evID1

abs_time[30370] evID1
...
abs_time[30370+180] evID1


Note the assignment of evID1 because nothing else had changed (same 
venue, beer). If I make one week a wine event, it has to have a new 
eventID (evID3) so it can have new properties. Yes it can 
inherit...that's not the point here.

So by this, I have a time_scale of 10 minute slices assigned to an 
unlimited number of evIDs as scheduled. Let this be the "virtual" 
database, because nobody wants to manage time as a collection of 10 
minute slices ad-infinitum.

Or do we?

The linear algebra that can be used to manage an array of uniform time 
slices like that is very, very fast. An "event" is a function of time 
f(t). A "disturbance" such as daylight savings time is a (usually 
linear) warping of the time base..a set of limits on t for which f(t) is 
to be adjusted by some algorithm. In fact, non-linear warping is fine, 
too  so if for example putamare is introducing some reality-augmenting 
substances to his chyme ("chyme, meet my colorful little sugar-coated 
friend") during the time that overlaps an event, the calendar can 
non-linearly warp time for him so he stays in step with the rest of the 
crowd (provided anyone can characterize putamare....let that stand as an 
assumption for now).

So we don't really need to store an event as a sequence of bits but as 
an periodic function. For most events the event function is completely 
described by a constant (event is ON or OFF) and for one-time events the 
preiodic event is similarly trivial as it is also a constant plus a 
start/duration.

For recurring events that are sensible, the storage is simply a few 
parameters representing a periodic function (square wave...square wave 
with a frequency of oscillation and a start). For really complicated 
recurring events, there is a predictable periodicity if they are based 
on the calendar (and they can therefore be written as functions). That 
covers anything that references days of the week or nth week of the 
month or nth Tuesday of even months during Spring and Fall or even moon 
phases or dates relative to DST even.

Even whacked recurring events can often be referenced to another 
singular definable event and are thus easily represented as functions. 
Completely arbitrary recurring events, are well.... not recurring :-)

So what gets stored (and queried)? Well... seems unlikely we want to do 
linear algebra on a web server for potentially every HTTP request, so we 
need temp tables of "event date". How often must they be regenerated? 
How far out into the future do we need to have handy, or at what cost do 
we ask the smarter server to regenerate them? How often will it be 
updated, and how far into the future?

All application specific...but think of all that a-priori knowledge 
available to the application developer at that point. A doctor may 
schedule 15 minute appointments across 4 rooms 3 months in advance.... A 
hotel may book night long reservations 2 years in advance.  A cruise 
ship may book week long reservations 2 years in advance. When the Doctor 
looks ahead 2 months, pause to regenerate that table set? At first 
looking back is clumsy as it can be huge... but then history won't 
change so those are archives anyway.

Plenty of flexibility and it all belongs to the application developer. 
That's what I see so far...

Well now you're cheating. ;-)

Or rather, you're making a practical case for pre-rendering all of
those time slices so that when you go to render a calendar view
(whether 1 month or 3 days or 2 hours) you can just fetch all of the
slices that apply and spit them out in a template.

Yes, exactly. You just never update timeslices that apply to times in the past.

I'm not sure how much longer this needs to carry on, but I'll go back
to my original post and point out that there is some benefit to just
brute-force plotting recurring events as they are inserted / updated.
There's around 500,000 10-minute time slices between now and 2016.
It's a big number, but not scary big. Any single recurring event is
going to touch a miniscule fraction of them.

So your "temp" table could actually reflect changes in real time.

And lets not forget that people and resources can be mapped to
timeslices as well, which gives you scheduling capability.

But the real question is... who besides Jeff Knight is crazy enough to
build such a system?
If you get it right, you'll be well on your way to replacing
everybody's most-hated email server....

or letting the app developer cheat as possible/practical, while 
protecting the "raw" data from harm. YES re: the calendar view being 
just about what it is now. I abstract the event database and design it 
to support optimizations that support such views.

For many deployments I expect that to be the case :-)  They would push 
back to the time slice database prior to regenerating new "temp" tables.

Whoa there cowboy. I am way too smart to get involved with scheduling. 
Next thing you know somebody will want to predict the shortest path for 
a traveling salesman, too!

Me and my Matlab are well on the way. I have no idea of the numerical 
capabilities of a web server, but expect to find out someday.

I have this simple 3-line test script (which actually says dneba.com 
rather than example.com ;-):

<?php
   if ( mail( 'southwell at example.com', 'simple testing', 'no 
variables here' ) === FALSE ) echo 'There was an error accepting your 
review.  Please try again later.';
   else echo 'Your mail was sent.';

Running it from domain #1 (and also #3, 4, and 5) works 
perfectly.  Running it from domain #2 gives a confirmation message, 
but the mail never arrives.

Aha, #2 is running php 5.1.2 and the others are still 4.  But the php 
docs don't tell me anything about why this extremely simple example 
will work in 4 and not 5.  Any ideas?

Also look to see if your php.ini is a little funky as per this bug ...

One of the most important parts of publishing complex content like
events is caching of the generated data structures, output, & other
relevant pieces.  One way to do that is to generate another table in a
publication process so that you *can* do the 1 query version on
intermediate de-normalized and less complex data. Or, of course you can
cache output, etc.

After a couple of weeks playing with Arctic  -

The gui is very nice and intuitive.

Unfortunatly it's missing a few key features at the moment (like
filters and sorting) that make it un-usable for us.

I would check that the mail server and dns on server 2 is actually 
correct and that the mail isn't being eaten by spam filter somewhere.  
If you have a bad return-path address I have run into this problem.  Or 
if you are sending from an address that doesn't exist or if the server 
doesn't have a reverse lookup address.

Message-ID: <442D72A1.3080204@cyberxdesigns.com>

I have a windows xp box with php4 on apache 1.3 and php5 on apache 2 and 
the db is MySQL 4.1.  When I start the php5 apache phpinfo reports 
Client API version 4.1.18.  When I start php4 and Apache 1.3 phpinfo 
reports Client API version 3.23.blah.  I can not figure out how to 
update my client version for the php4 instance.  When I try to connect 
to the 4.1 db with the php it complains about the wrong client.  There 
was at some point 3.23 on this box, but that was ages ago.  Any ideas?

Thanks,
Hans

update the password for the mysql user using old_password('yourpassword').

This one hit kept me up once awhile ago, so just to clarify quickly: 
MySQL prior to 4.1 was using a smaller encryption on the password field
inside the database.

So when you run the query:
SET PASSWORD FOR root @ localhost = OLD_PASSWORD('root_current_pwd');
... now root's pwd is saved the older way.

Additionally, if you look further you can startup MysQL with a switch to
make the entire db 
use the old password encryption style.

Hey now that's a positive first impression!  Spam the talk list with 
your recruiter ad (slightly edited):

"My name is Beau Gould and I'm a recruiter specializing in open source 
staffing. I've got a trillion tri-state clients begging me for skilled 
PHP/MySQL Developers and I thought this would be a good way to attract 
good candidates. Since I am not local to NYC (anymore) I was hoping to 
find someone to take care of organizing the meetups. Anyone interested 
can email beaudiddly at open-source-stuffing.com. In the meantime, please 
feel free to check out the message board for my current tri-state 
opportunities.

What's the commission for "someone to take care of organizing the 
meetups"? lol

Alrighty,  I booted up a machine that has only ever had MySQL 4.1 on 
it.  I installed Apache 1.3 from the Apache Installer, then I installed 
PHP from the zip file downloaded from the PHP.net site.

When I run phpinfo() on this new setup, it reports:  Client API Version: 
3.23.49.  I did a search on the computer for libmysql.dll and found 1 
copy in the bin folder of MySQL 4.1 and 1 copy in my PHP4 folder.  I 
took the copy from the bin folder of MySQL 4.1 and replaced the version 
in the PHP folder.  Stopped and restarted apache, phpinfo still reports 
3.23.49 as the client version.  Anyone have any new ideas?

Thanks,
Hans

Oh, I reckon no commission would be necessary... provided the

I apologize if this has already been discussed to death here but I  
would love to hear people's thoughts on it.    I am trying to justify  
to a colleague why the behavior below is not a massive flaw in PHP.    
To a new programmer,   the following code should result in  $a being  
equal to $b:

$a="49.95" + "3.95";   // or even  $a = 49.95 + 3.95;
$b=53.90;

Unfortunately floats in PHP are subject to the same problems you find  
in many languages with fixed precision.   So due to rounding, in this  
case $a is not equal to $b.     This behavior is documented in the  
manual:  http://www.php.net/manual/en/ 
language.types.float.php#AEN3375    Straight from the manual:  "So  
never trust floating number results to the last digit and never  
compare floating point numbers for equality."   Come again?  Never  
compare floating point numbers for equality?   And thats not a bad  
thing?

Given the fact that PHP is so easy to learn and that it is very  
commonly used for financial related tasks such as ecommerce,  doesn't  
it stand to reason that people will assume that they can use the  
internal PHP operators on dollar amounts?   Since many people are  
going to just assume they can do math in a natural manner,  shouldn't  
PHP a little more proactive to ensure that developers won't get  
burned by this?

I've spoken to a few php contributors about this have had very little  
interest in tackling this issue.  The "official" answer is that if  
you are doing math on fixed precision numbers you should use either  
the bc or gmp but these extension as not even enabled by default.

 From what I understand,  there would be a speed penalty for  
detecting and dealing with fixed percision numbers.  Some people  
might not mind the speed hit so why not make it a configurable  
choice?  Or why not create a built in fixed precision type?  Whatever  
the case, I think PHP needs a built in solution that does not rely on  
extensions. Thoughts?

So the php.ini being used (when calling phpinfo()) is definatley  
pointing to this extension?  Might want to scan the entire .ini file  
for what extension is being used, might be redeclared somewhere, else  
a strange problem indeed.

Thoughts?

if ($a < $b + .01 && $a > $b - .01)
    {
    echo("Yes, close enough.");
    }
else
    {
    echo("No");

Or to whatever precision you want.

I've found for me a more clear way to do this is:

define('epsilon', 0.01);

if (abs($a - $b) < epsilon) {

But I don't feel strongly about it. :)

no in php4 the mysql stuff is built in
from php.ini:
;Windows Extensions
;Note that MySQL and ODBC support is now built in, so no dll is needed 
for it.

I thought that php snaps had a php_mysql.dll that came with it --
but it turns out the library is libmysql.dll not php_mysql.dll
(sorry 'bout that chief)

I did some minimal searching for a php_mysqli.dll for php4 and
came up empty.

I guess you would have to build your own php
(using the updated client)
Maybe you could build a php_mysqli.dll for php4 --
but I think it might be more of a challenge than its
worth it can even be done.

You definitely need to have a bag of tricks when you start dealing
with monetary values (or other floats) in php. I felt exactly the same
frustration the first time I crossed over from content management into
commerce: four years of writing php code and I had never used
number_format().

Are there any good articles or tipsheets out there on working with
money in php? If not, maybe there should be a Financial Phundamentals
to help get other developers up to speed on the best practices for
being arbitrarily precise.

Banks just handle monetary values to 4 or 6 decimal places.  If you 
manipulate values as "49.9500", it doesn't matter what you do to it, it 
will come out correct to the cent.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Output Buffer FLUSH
Message-ID: <20060401032145.32CA0A862D@virtu.nyphp.org>

Hello everybody,

 

I would really appreciate if one of you more experienced programmers could
help me out on this.

I am trying to get to work both in Firefox and Internet Explorer this little
script below which mainly is based on output flushing.

 

<?PHP

for ($i=1; $i<=4; $i++) {

    echo $i.'<br />';

    flush();

    sleep(1);

}

 

?>

This should display some kind of a counter, each number appearing after a
second has passed. 

 

This works just fine in Firefox, but somehow I cannot get Internet Explorer
to flush its buffer.

 

Does anyone have any idea?!

 

Thanks in advance!

You need to flush a larger chunk of data to IE according to some ...

echo str_pad('',4096)."\n";
