Sorry for the late reply, I've been a little behind on my list reading.

I'm using my recent unemployment to study LAMP technologies myself,
coming from a largely ASP background (& am still working on setting up a 
fully functional server, so haven't much PHP experience yet)

I wonder why not take the hidden field idea a step further and just put
the result set IDs directly into it & let the page take care of itself? 

It sounds like you're not using sessions for anything else as yet.

if i'm following correctly...  you're suggesting that instead of
propagating the result set id list to a GET/url variable or in a
cookie or in a temporary database row...  that you do a silent
POST with the id's in a hidden field...

this presents the problem of having to create a form on each
of the result pages...  so, say, the page-turning links couldn't
just be variations on the result url, they'd have to be javascript
links that would POST the form containing the hidden field...
essentially turning every page-turn into a simulated form POST,
not a simpler click on an actual href...  thus, removing the
possibility of the user being able to bookmark the search result.

I know that PHP uses $HTTP_FORM_VARS associative array variable (or $FORM
too I think I forget), however, can PHP use these variables if the form
submitted was of type multipart/form-data?

E.g.

<form method=post action=blah.php enctype=multipart/form-data>
...
<input type=file name=file>
...
</form>

How would PHP handle a form such as this, where you would be uploading
files?

The date function is very good at formating dates.

Here's a long code which exemplifies some of the date functionality:


// what are the start and end days for this date?
$date = "2002-02-22";



// get start's date timestamp
$date_timestamp = strtotime($date);

// this returns day of week numeric, i.e. "0" (Sunday) to "6" (Saturday)
$dayw = date("w", $date_timestamp);

// unix timestamps for start and end days of the week
$start_week_u = mktime (0, 0, 0, date("m", $date_timestamp), date("d",
$date_timestamp)-$dayw, date("Y", $date_timestamp));
$end_week_u = mktime (0, 0, 0, date("m", $date_timestamp), date("d",
$date_timestamp)+6-$dayw, date("Y", $date_timestamp));

// convert them to the format you
$Startdate = date("Y-m-d", $start_week_u);
$Enddate = date("Y-m-d", $end_week_u);

Sure, not a problem. Any time I need to deal with file uploads I use 
multipart/form-data, works just  the same.

You can use functions like:

$sunday = date("m/d/y", strtotime("-6 days"));
$saturday = date("m/d/y", strtotime("+1 days"));

in a 'switch (date("w", $inputDate)){}' statement, testing for the weekday
of the given date.  I tried the textual parameters for date (like "last
Sunday") but I found them unreliable, especially when dealing with things
like looking for "next Tuesday" when the supplied date is a Tuesday.

Yes, you're following correctly, every page turn would be a POST
request, though there's no need for JavaScript that I can see.
'Next'/'Last' links just need to be in the form of good old-fashioned
button or image elements. Personally I consider the maintenance of a 
form to be no more complicated than working with the query string. 

But I was writing in response to Joseph Annino: 

"I'm thinking a way to kill two birds with one stone is to create a
unique 'search session id' and place it in hidden fields and urls ...

which seemed to introduce hidden fields as a means of tracking a 'search
session id' for a lookup in a temporary row, which seemed redundant if
the hidden form is already there. It's an approach I'm trying out
recently in a project where until now I've just re-run the query on
every page, and it happens to be well suited to my data. If users leave
the 2 level deep result set pages they lose the results (though if
cookies are accepted the search field values are remembered)

If you want particular search results to be bookmarkable obviously it
won't work. In that case you can't rely on temporary database rows
either, but must put everything in the query string.

It was just a thought,
Ken

buttons and images would be suitable, though.  however, in your method
you'd have to have a seperate <form> and seperate submit button for
every page.  instead of just writing a clever javascript handler change
a hidden page number field and doing the form.submit()

thoughts are good!
i actually wouldn't have even considered it had you not mentioned it.
and in some cases (intranet apps, for example) 'hiding' the id list
is definately preferable...  as well as preventing bookmarking.

how would I obtain the actual file name, file size, content-type and the

My strategy is typically to have a HEAP table that I can dump the results
in all tied to a search id (microtime hashed into a nice string) and then
each time you pass in that search id, your starting point in the search,
and the number of results you want and as yous ay use LIMIT to control
which results you get back. This is pretty simple to implement and is fast
no matter how compelx the original query.

Another practice that can help is to run a nightly script (cron jobs are
your friend) to unnormalize your data into a table that is much quicker to
search and doesn't require joins and things like that. Again if you have
the memory then consider making the table a HEAP so that it sits in memory
and is quicker to search. Since this type of data is regenerated from
other data it doesn't matter if you were to lose it unexpectedly. :)


Don't dream it. Be it.

Message-ID: <F1914fDGCl9FopYC98B0000f5c9@hotmail.com>

Hey phil

U can use that file handle same as in mulitipart for data.
But for file uploading u can also get many other file varibales..

like $file_name, $file_type, $file_size which are diff atributes of your 
file var called "$file"

And u must pass a hidden var..called <inout type=hidden name=MAX_FILE_SIZE 
value=10000000> to tell php that how much file size
u r going to upload..

Thanks

Subject: upgrading to mysql 4
Message-ID: <3D7500D2.6020501@plusfour.org>

When upgrading to mysql 4 from 3.23.49.. do i have to recompile php?

I have checked out this link 
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Upgrading-from-3.23.html..

I noticed some concerns on the mysql upgrade page about upgrading via 
rpm under redhat 7.2. Would it be better to just unistall the rpm, then 
compile, and install from the source?

Also we are using full text searching.. to do so with 4, and use boolean 
searches would I have to rebuild all the tables, even if all our curent 
table types are MyISAM..?

We figure its a good idea to install mysql  max, are there any concerns 
going from 3.23.49 to 4.0.3 max?

Regards
Ian

Has anyone gotten the latest version of php to
work with Apache 2? 

Or, does anyone know when PHP 4.2.3 will be out.
I'm on a windows box so I can't recompile apache
or php but I'd like to use the module version of
php rather than the cgi since I get more features
to work with.

There are some known problems with the compiler included in RH. 
(http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html).  And for production
level servers on Linux I always use MySQL's supplied binary (although
I've compiled a 3.x server on FreeBSD and have had no problems - then
again I did the same on a RH 6.2 server and had no problems, but Linux
[RH 7.x] makes me nervous).

As noted in the 4.0 upgrade link, new fulltext indexes are used, so
you'll need to rebuild them.  Unless it's a huge DB, I always feel
better recreating/importing the whole tables - you never know what tiny
differences there are in the new handler code.

I've heard/seen 4 to be pretty good, but I'm always paranoid about a
major version increase like that, so backup, backup and rebuild. :)

I wrote this ages ago and haven't checked it in just as long, but no
one has complained about the libraries that use it, so it must work,
right?

define('_SECSINDAY', 86400);
define('_SECSINWEEK', 604800);

/*** returns first and last second of surrounding calendar week ***/
function time2week( $timestamp ) {
   $tmp = date('G:i:s:w',$timestamp);
   $tmp = explode(':',$tmp);
   $tmp =
(($tmp[0]*60*60)+($tmp[1]*60)+($tmp[2]))+($tmp[3]*_SECSINDAY);
   return array($timestamp-$tmp,($timestamp-$tmp)+(_SECSINWEEK-1));
}

Hi All:

I am uploading a file in PHP on Windows2k (via HTTP Uploads), and when I go to copy the file, I get the error:

Warning: Unable to open C:WINNTTEMPphp1D.tmp

Doesn't it seem as though the "\\"s are being taken out?

Does anyone have any pointers?

Thanks!

Jeremy,
Check this one out, it's working on win2k server:

function uploadfile($filehandle,$filename) {
global $fileuploaddir;
 if (is_uploaded_file($filehandle)) {
   $result=move_uploaded_file($filehandle, "$fileuploaddir".$filename);
 }
 return $result;
}

You are probably trying to use filename instead of file handle, I hope above
code helps.

Hello Everyone,

Sorry about the off topic question but I am having a problem with my webserver and I know that there are alot of experienced admins out there that might be able to help.  I am running Redhat 7.3 with Apache compiled from source. It runs on a server that also acts as a firewall/gateway for our LAN.  From within the LAN there is no problem accessing the webserver. However users outside the LAN have trouble from time to time. Their browsers will not open any urls on this server.  At the times when the browser will not open the site the users are able to ping the same url's successfully.  And then minutes later after trying again the browser will open the websites.

Does anyone know why Apache might not be responding to requests?

The primary URL in question is 

http://www.dolemite.org

Thanks for your time!

-Tom

"\\" is an escape notation, so doesn't show up in the final string, unless
you escape it.  Use "/" or "\\\\" as your directory separator.

Message-ID: <13844456093.20020904110134@panvox.net>

Here's the scenario:

In selecting an ingredient to include in a recipe the user makes the
choice, then chooses the unit of measure ( Hamburger 3 ounce ), however, 
some ingredients have a custom conversion unit available to them which is 
a user defined unit of measure,  and other ingredients don't. 

Problem:  When loading the select boxes with ingredients, the user has 
yet to choose an ingredient, so determining if an ingredient has a custom 
conversion associated with it is unknown.

My thought here is to write/load a JavaScript array with the all the 
custom conversions and their associated ingredients.  When an ingredient 
is selected a function determines if that ingredient has a custom 
conversion associated with it, if yes, then the unit of measures 
available to that ingredient in the next select box are updated to 
reflect the fact that the selected ingredient has custom conversion 
munits to choose from in addition to the standard measurements.

So mixing the JS and the PHP, is this a sound method, or would one 
recommend doing it all server-side?  If the recommendation is server-side 
I envision lots of page updates in the process.

FYI: I know my client will have JavaScript enabled.

Any thoughts?

Thanks, Pete

check your "upload_tmp_dir" variable on php.ini, and make sure you're
escaping the "\\" character, that is make it "\\\\" if inside a string.

Hi All:

I am uploading a file in PHP on Windows2k (via HTTP Uploads), and when I go
to copy the file, I get the error:

Warning: Unable to open C:WINNTTEMPphp1D.tmp

Doesn't it seem as though the "\\"s are being taken out?

Does anyone have any pointers?

Thanks!

It seems that the trade off to consider is whether the conversion information
is so voluminous to download that it would cause more problems than the
multiple page updates if you use PHP for the conversion information.  If it
is relatively simple and easily managed in JavaScript, I'd go that way.

I assume you have Javascript changing a popup menu to indicate the valid 
measurements. For those ingredients that can have a "custom" 
measurement, I would add "Custom" as the last option in the popup. You 
can than add an OnChange handler to that popup which checks if the 
"Custom" option was selected. If custom was specified, you can generated 
a "popup" window that will allow them to enter the custom value. Using a 
popup window would allow you to use php to query for only the valid 
items, rather than downloading all of the possible options when perhaps 
none of them would be used.

Back on the main page you can have a hidden field that gets updated from 
the popup window. The hidden field would contain the custom value 
specified. The problem here is to actually display the custom value on 
the main page. Perhaps DHTML or CSS could solve this problem.

This scenario mixes the server-side and client-side techniques, using 
the whichever is best for the situation.

A method I use which minimizes the JavaScript as well as minimizes the
required page loads is to use an iframe for the conversion info.  When the
user chooses the ingredient it refreshes the iframe with the selected
ingredient.  The iframe can then hold the info & choices allowable for that
ingredient.  You need javascript to trigger the iframe refresh, and
javascript to grab user choices from the iframe and put them into your base
form as part of submit.

When I first saw the chainedselectors class that builds two drop downs,
with the second one repopulating based on the first choice, I was trilled.

http://www.zend.com/zend/tut/drop-down.php

Later, I found a couple of things that could be definitively improved in
the javascript (the blank spaces at the end, and all the code is not very
effective).
One of my side projects (whenever corporate life gives me a break), is to
rewrite this class.

Check it out and see if that's what you need... maybe this will give me the
incentive :)

Here's the scenario:

In selecting an ingredient to include in a recipe the user makes the
choice, then chooses the unit of measure ( Hamburger 3 ounce ), however,
some ingredients have a custom conversion unit available to them which is
a user defined unit of measure,  and other ingredients don't.

Problem:  When loading the select boxes with ingredients, the user has
yet to choose an ingredient, so determining if an ingredient has a custom
conversion associated with it is unknown.

My thought here is to write/load a JavaScript array with the all the
custom conversions and their associated ingredients.  When an ingredient
is selected a function determines if that ingredient has a custom
conversion associated with it, if yes, then the unit of measures
available to that ingredient in the next select box are updated to
reflect the fact that the selected ingredient has custom conversion
munits to choose from in addition to the standard measurements.

So mixing the JS and the PHP, is this a sound method, or would one
recommend doing it all server-side?  If the recommendation is server-side
I envision lots of page updates in the process.

FYI: I know my client will have JavaScript enabled.

Any thoughts?

Thanks, Pete

What are some good ways to manage hierarchical templates when using
Apache/MySQL/PHP?

I am accustomed to Frontier's approach, where a site and its sub-directories
are contained within a hierarchical object database. This made it very
natural to have layout and boilerplate items which apply selectively,
depending upon where a given web page exists in the hierarchy, or what
server directives are present. Conditionally grabbing something from the
object database was very easy to do. The bulk of the page rendering involved
replacement of placeholder strings with database values.

OTOH, I felt cramped using Frontier, because I had often had to figure out
how to work within the framework to achieve customized effects.

Using MySQL to store such components seems like overkill. Do most php
developers use a file-based strategy coupled with include, require, or
fileio methods.?

Another option is Dreamweaver MX, which has a template framework. It seems
to have a crude system for conditional components ('optional region'). I
have experimented a bit with Dreamweaver's web application framework for
PHP/MySQL, and my first inclination is to NOT become overly dependent on the
Dreamweaver way of doing things. Moving data from a MySQL table into a basic
HTML table is easy, but doing things that break the simple mold might get
cumbersome. Granted, I've only tinkered with it for a few days.

Are there some "common practices" out there, or perhaps website frameworks
for PHP that don't have a 6 month learning curve?

Basic Example:

The layout of the info flowing through the different "topics" below is
roughly similar. But the specific navigation bars, jump menus, and other
elements of the page margins are specific to each topic. The customized
aspects could be in a database or defined within preference files located at
various levels of the site.

  site
    topic_1
       category_1
       category_2
       category_3
    topic_2
       category_1
       category_2
   
Not such a great example, I hope people get my point.

I looked at the output of phpinfo() for what's probably the 1000000th
time in my life, and noticed a new directive (4.2.2/1.3.26).  Right up
at the top, I saw "Virtual Directory Support" and noticed it was
disabled.

I've googled left and right for what it is, but can't locate anything. 
I've also checked the compile time options (which is what it seems like
it would be) but to no avail.  My best guess so far is it's part of the
suEXEC Apache module (I'm pretty sure it's an Apache thing, rather than
PHP).

Any clues would be great,

I implemented a set of select lists exactly the way you described, and it
seems to work very well, especially in a controlled environment.  I build an
array with the names and values of the second list, as well as the
associated value from the primary list.  Then, when the user selects
something from List A, you grab the value, and create an option in List B
for each element in the array where the associated value matches.  Even with
an array of 50+ items, it loads very quickly.

is selected a function determines if that ingredient has a custom 
conversion associated with it, if yes, then the unit of measures 
available to that ingredient in the next select box are updated to 
reflect the fact that the selected ingredient has custom conversion 
munits to choose from in addition to the standard measurements.

So mixing the JS and the PHP, is this a sound method, or would one 
recommend doing it all server-side?  If the recommendation is server-side 
I envision lots of page updates in the process.

FYI: I know my client will have JavaScript enabled.

Any thoughts?

Thanks, Pete

Hello Tom,

That's  the  route  I'm  working  throuhg  right  now,  however,  the
Javascript  is  giving  me  headaches.   i  hate the way JS does error
messages!

Have  a  peek  at the function I'm writing to be called on each SELECT
onChange:

If you have any suggestions as to improvement please feel free

Pete

function addToSelect(arr)
{
    
    var oOption;
    var len = document.forms[1].elements[0].options.length;
    
    for(var t = 0; t < len;  t++)
    {
        if(document.forms[1].elements[0].options[t].selected == true )        
        {
            var text = document.forms[1].elements[0].options[t].value;
            text = text.split(":");
            alert(text[1]);

            alert('Option value is ' + document.forms[1].elements[0].options[t].value);
             for(var j = 0; j < arr.length; ++j)

Hi.

I'm looking for some material on building fairly complex content management
systems with PHP.
Not looking for PHP reference specifically, much more of a nice in-depth
analysis of database structures, granularity, administration features, etc.

Any information would be a help. Thanks.

Most open source CMS systems have their Specs and APIs documented. That would make a nice starting point.

for better debugging load the page up in netscape and then open the
javascript console by typing javascript: as the location...  gives far
better detail about syntax and specific problems with your js then
Inshmernet Exploiter ever will.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Templating and design strategies
In-Reply-To: <200209042015.g84KF1Gb015045@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <B99D0EFA.11561%jannino@jannino.com>

I like vlibTemplate which can be found at:
http://vlib.activefish.com/

It uses a template syntax very close to the Perl module HTML::Template.
What I like about is that it is a very simple limited template language,
keeping you from doing things in templates you really should be doing in
your code, and so in doing keeps design and logic as separated as possible,
making it easier for clients to change their own templates if they so
choose.  This doesn't make it hard to use, as data is fed into the template
using simple associative arrays.  You can do loops and things too by either
making arrays of arrays, using some convenience methods, or just passing it
a database result.  It can recursively include other templates, and that
works with relative pathnames, so if you set up your directories properly,
you can have header information, etc change as you move files around.  It
also provides subclasses that can provide useful debugging information, or
compile and cache the templates for speed.

An added plus for me is being able to use the sample templates in Perl or
PHP.  I use both a lot, often in the same project, as each language has its
own strengths.

Fil Baumanis,

Slightly off topic... But I might suggest you also look at the following
open source portal sites.
I've found some interesting material by downloading these packages and
rummaging through the code and the .sql files.

Perhaps that might increase your general CMS knowledge while you search for
the books you mention...

Check out:

http://www.myphpnuke.com/
http://www.phpnuke.org
http://www.postnuke.com/

You may already be very familiar with these portals... But there may be some
folk out there just getting their feet wet with PHP and mySQL for Content
Management, and these sites will really help.

Hi folks,

Just a reminder about tonight's PHP Meetup at 7:00pm at the Remote
Lounge.  (details at http://php.meetup.com).  I've never been to one
before, but the venue is pretty cool (especially if you have a
voyeuristic fetish).

I'm signed up as a host, so I'll try to get there a little early. 
Also, I'll try to stay by the entrance and with a sign (I'll feel cool,
I'm sure).

See you there,

Hans

Why store the images in the database when it's so much more efficient to
store them on the hard drive and keep the file's path/name in the
database?

Ease of housekeeping? I hate trying to keep images names straight.
If it's all in a single record, it's easy. www.nsiinnovations.com
has a MySQL backend for most of it, including the pictures and
related PDFs for download. I'm not sure what state the data is
in (not my site, I just did the programming), but there should
be something there to show how it works.

Because that is the system design.  For one thing, it enables a clean backup
and recovery.  I'm not sure of all the reasons but I do know that I am stuck
with it.

Bill,

You have to store images as blobs, which means you can't use a
plain old SQL statement.

Here's a simple example:

  //$image = {contents of image file};

  $sql = "INSERT INTO IMAGE_TABLE (IMAGE_ID, IMAGE)
           VALUES ($NewImageID, EMPTY_BLOB()) returning IMAGE into
:img";

  $blobdesc = OCINewDescriptor($conn, OCI_D_LOB);

  if ($qry = OCIParse($conn, $sql)) {

    OCIBindByName($qry, ":img", &$blobdesc, -1, OCI_B_BLOB);

    if (OCIExecute($qry, OCI_DEFAULT)){
      if ($image) {
        $blobdesc->save($image);
      }
      OCICommit($conn);
    }
    else {
      OCIRollback($conn);
    }

    OCIFreeStatement($qry);

  }

The one thing I don't know how to do is trap errors in the
$blobdesc->save method.

Getting the image back out can be done with a normal SQL select.
Just remember to tell OCIFetchInto to return LOB 
columns, as in: OCIFetchInto($qry, &$rslt, OCI_RETURN_LOBS)

Oracle is practical?  :)

You need the DB field to be BLOB (Binary Large OBject).  You'll need to
ensure that the functions you use are binary safe, but most PHP
functionality in this repsect is (whether OCI/MySQL/etc).  If you are
using Oracle, the [bind?] functions are made for this, although there
are other ways.

Thanks to the people who kindly wrote to me about the binary data
issue.  We handled it by going to a work-around using
base64_encode/base64_decode.  This puts the binary data into text form
but requires another 33% storage space.  These functions were also
useful in another part of the system involving binary data, so we got
two with one.

Hello all,

It looks like PHP-4.2.3 was just released.  To help in distribution,
the main downloads are available from http://parsec.nyphp.org/mirror/

Feel free to pass this URL on to as many as you'd like.  As new
releases are made, they should always be available here as well.

Enjoy!

It's only a minor release, but remember that 4.2.2 was strictly a
security release.  So essentially, 4.2.3 is the fixes from 4.2.1.

Lays everything out:

The only things I can think of are make sure file permissions are 
correct. Not only the file owner and group but that the attributes 
(read, write, execute) are correct also. Then make sure that the 
permissions are correct for the include folder. I know this sounds petty 
but is the file in the folder?

That's all I can think of off hand.

Maybe the include path made the error? You can put both files in same directory to try out. (or the file permission.)

Subject: NYPHP Presents to NYLUG
Message-ID: <20020909135838.65385.qmail@web12802.mail.yahoo.com>


Good morning again,

NYPHP will be giving an introductory meeting to NYLUG
(http://nylug.org) at their monthly meeting (9/18).

I am working on an outline for the presentation, but I would like some
help filling in the gaps.  This means:

-- I do not have a laptop.  Does anyone have a laptop available?
(Win2K/Linux/whatever, but network connectivity will be important).

-- Like I say, I will have a presentation outline and some slides
(probably webpages, actually) later this week.  However, I would like
some assistance in giving the presentation, preferably someone with
more "presenting" skills than I, and anyone that would like to help
with content creation is more than welcome as well!

-- Anyone that would like to meet to prepare for the presentation, or
at the meeting itself (I will get there @ 6:00pm on 9/18 at IBM in
midtown - details at http://nylug.org).

-- At the very least, show up at the NYLUG meeting!

Please contact me offlist (zaunere at yahoo.com) with any followup.

Thank you,

Hans Z.

you could add an .htaccess file in the web dir with the line php_value 
include_path /users/ppowell/web
or in the require() put.. require("./menubar_functions.php");

you could add an .htaccess file in the web dir with the line php_value 
include_path /users/ppowell/web
or in the require() put.. require("./menubar_functions.php");

I'd suggest that for something a little more advanced than the *nukes, take
a look at Midgard (http://www.midgard-project.com/).  It is very well
documented, very well thought out and far more flexible than the *nukes.
However, it is just a library of APIs with no front end.  There is a well-
developed front-end for it called Nadmin Studio (http://www.nadminstudio.com/)
and a few others that you'll find referenced on the Midgard site.

There are also a handful of books on CMS that I've seen in B&N stores, but I
have done nothing more than flip through them so I can't recommend any one in
particular.

You'll have to post this onto nyphp, for I cannot right now..

the php file menubar_functions.php exists in the same directory as the
other PHP files, all of which reside in the root directory and have never
been changed since they were first uploaded.  Unfortunately I don't know
when the error first occurred but it had worked for months before.

Hello folks,

There was a bug in the MIME handler, and as a result some messages got
their body chopped off (as did the above message).  This should now be
fixed, so repost if you can.

Sorry about that,

Subject: GD imageCreate
Message-ID: <20020909183552.GA19561@bnl.gov>

Is anyone using the imageCreate function to create on the fly
graphics? I'm playing with my new toy, a weather station, and
it's logging to a MySQL database. I'm taking the info, and creating
a graphic button, which, when clicked, will go to graphs, etc.
The problem is the load of the server when creating the graphic. I've run
some stress tests, and the results are *not* pretty. Is there any way to 
cache the image for a period of time?

Perhaps a cronjob that runs when the weather gets updated/changed... and
just link to the static file? 

Creating a on the fly graphic that is the same every time for every user
is overly redundant...?

Tim-

Fun with GD.... you're not alone in your frustration with the amount of
CPU it consumes to make one simple image.

Look at the imagepng() function... there is a 2nd optional argument that
will take a filename to output the file to.  With that you can generate
the image file to disk only as often as you'd like based on the system clock,
number of hits, etc. Saves your web server from being so bogged down a LOT.

Subject: Search Engine Indexable PHP Sites
Message-ID: <8FA07D8665A9D511B80E00B0D068A1510293A7A3@ehope16.hew.us.ml.com>

Greetings,

I've developed a LAMP based online catalog for a jewelry company and for the most part the site is great.  The problem is that nobody can tell it works so well due, in large part to the fact that I
can't get the site indexed by the search engines.  I believe this is because it is a dynamic site and each url on the generated pages contain references to sub-pages using
pagename.php?variable1=value&variable2=value

I've read up on a few articles from evolt.org and searchtools regarding "clean" urls and I have embarked on a redevelopment of the site to use urls like

http://www.camelotbridal.com/new/index/rings/2 (keep in mind - I'm currently working on this so don't be shocked by the debug output and random errors)

Instead of 

http://www.camelotbridal.com/index.php?p=rings&c=3 

My question is this: 

Are there any tools that mimic the search engines indexing behavior so that I can gauge the effectiveness of my redevelopment?

I've tried weblech and it's quite nice - builds a directory tree with the results of a scan of my new layout.  But is weblech doing /just/ what the spiders are?  There should be a tool that mimics
each search engine spider (google, altavista, etc)... If not, then I'm wondering if someone knows how to get hold of the searching behaviour of the most popular engines.  For example: Does the spider
stop when it finds a url with a "?" in it (second example above).

Mike

Hi,

I'm also using gd library to createa on the fly images for my free counter site. I've observed
that using fonts (any) is consuming huge amount of cpu and memory. Try to not to use different
font files and or try to reduce character count in word or sentences.
Also you may create a bacground image and try to load it instead of creating it also on the fly.

That's what I'm doing, actually. My wife created me the backgroud image,
but in order to get color allocation right, you still have to make a
temp image to do the allocations. It's very frustrating. Making on the fly
graphics with GD seem to use 16 bytes of memory for each pixel in the
inital imageCreate(), so it not only uses lots of CPU, but memory...
There's got to be a better way...

not really.
each search engine uses their own rules on what and how to index.

for the most part question marks in a URL are a sure way of reducing
your chance of getting into a search engine.

your best bet is to read up on sites like searchenginewatch.com to understand
how they work.

While the "path info" solution (what you're trying to do) is much better
than the previous URLs, I personally prefer using mod_rewrite.  

That way you can create a url like http://www.camelotbridal.com/rings_3_something.html
and have apache convert it to http://www.camelotbridal.com/index.php?p=rings&c=3


Either way, I think you should add .html as a file suffix (even if u
don't use it).
Something like http://www.camelotbridal.com/new/index/rings/2/x.html

Adam,
    It makes plenty of sense. Lori wants some help inserting the 
following field names into a MySQL database, then Querying them and 
displaying results on a webpage. At least that's what I got out of it.

    I don't know of any similar projects but you can definitely find 
answers in the php docs.

some languages like Chinese have different character sets,  people who want to view it have to download some langauge support softwares, but I just heared if program can create those characters to be an image on the fly, then it will skip the download, it is very convenient. but I don't know how to do, maybe this is also related to this question. Does anyone have some ideas on it? thanks!

It certainly doesn't help, but I'm starting to see query strings show
up in google (OT: there's a pretty interesting site at
http://www.google-watch.org  but anyway).  Also, submit your site to
dmoz.org and you're golden (it worked for NYPHP.org anyway  :)

Speaking of google, search for:
php search friendly

I found the PromotionBase and Zend titled articles most helpful.  There
was an issue with the PATH_INFO method, however this seems to be
cleared up (supposedly).

I just wrote something like this, and you can pass variables/values and
the search engine won't even know:
http://site/about/var_value/var2_value/somethingelse/var_value

It'll merge the vars/values to the preceeding dirname, then maps to the
real ondisk file.  I'm not sure how well this will work yet but I've
attached the source.  It's still dirty and if you have any question
don't hesitate to let me know.

Uhh, ok.  So to answer your real question, I have no idea - but I doubt
it.  For instance, I believe most spiders (ok, google's) are highly
guarded trade secrets.  While there are many public spiders out there,
I don't think you'll ever really find what the "big boys" use.

> There should be a tool that mimics

If there were, google would go out of business :) but I'm sure there
are some good sites dedicated to r-engineering how the spiders crawl.

For any kind of image/zip/binary/etc file, you need to use a BLOB
column type, if you want to do it on your own.

Subject: Apache configuration question
Message-ID: <B9A2E33B.1551%myersm@optonline.net>


Within our intranet, my department uses a WinNT sharevolume to store shared
documents, mostly PDFs and MS Office files.

I want to provide a web frontend that allows users to browse that
sharevolume, and the automatic directory indexing performed by Apache is
adequate. This also allows me to easily provide URLs to documents from
within email messages ( I despise 4MB PowerPoint attachments ).

I am running Apache on MacOSX, and the server is also running DAVE, which
allows me to mount the WinNT sharevolume.

Here's the rub: the files in the mounted directory are owned by my OSX user
account, not the "www" or "nobody" account usually applied to the Apache
instance.

I confirmed that I can browse the sharevolume if I make the necessary owner
and group change to the http.conf file, as well as include an Alias that
points to the mounted directory. But I wonder if that is a bad security
move.

Is there a safer way to configure this?

I could try changing the owner of the mounted sharevolume to "nobody", but I
don't know if that has any impact on the WinNT side of things. I will also
ask the folks at Thursby about this.

Thanks,

Mike M.

Give the files/directories/shares you want to share read permissions for
the "nobody" account.  No big deal security wise.  You want them to be
public.  So, if some unforseen circumstance arises, the exposure is the
same as if they wound up there with a web browser.

I wouldn't change the ownership of the files/directories etc.  Keep them
owned by you.  Making them owned by "nobody" would create a far greater
potential for exploitation.

If you need to have the files readable, then they need to be, well,
readable.

I haven't a clue how WinNT/OS-X all sees this, but it's generally a bad
idea to set the owner to an untrusted/generic user (especially nobody -
remember, if nobody owns everything, then he's somebody).  I generally
own everything as root or a specific regular user (that I set up only
for the task at hand), and then set group and world perms as needed.

Also, don't forget, that the owner of a given asset has special
abilities, up and above what ls -al shows as rwx permissions (which is
why I'm always finekey about setting the owner - there are also some
notes about primary group, etc. but I don't remember all the details).

HTH,

H

I've used Gallery for a number of projects... It creates it's own
thumbnails.
Also, you can set different levels of authority, letting one person upload
pics, while another can write captions.
And in fact, you can password protect certain galleries to make then
invisible to all but those logged in.


Further more, if you've got PHP but don't have a db backend... Gallery works
with flat files.

I used it for three or four clients, and am currently incorporating it in a
MyPHPNuke portal.

You can find it here:

Just a thought, If I can help more, touch base off-list.

For any kind of image/zip/binary/etc file, you need to use a BLOB

Photo albums?  There are a lot of those:

Hello,

Sorry if this is a RTFM question, but this list has been such a great 
resource I wanted to start here.

Just a question about printing from an array using PHP/MySQL

My real database and code is a little more complex then this, but to 
illustrate my problem let me say

1. I have two tables: "images" and "format". They each have two fields 
"id" and "name".

2. I have a query that says

$query= "SELECT images.id, format.id, format.name
FROM images, format
WHERE images.id=$id";  /* $id is a passed from a from*/

3. Then I assign the results to an array using

$result= mysql_query($query);

while ($row=mysql_fetch_array($result)

	{
		extract($row);

	}

4. Then I want to print the results which I would think would go like 
this:

echo "$images.id, $format.id, $format.name";

But it seems these are not the keys in the array, but instead there is 
just one $id key and the value of that is whatever "id" came last in 
the query. In other words, if the query read "Select format.id, 
images.id" then there would be a value in the array for $id equal to 
"images.id" and if query read "Select images.id, format.id" then there 
would be a value in the array for the key $id equal to "format_id".

I expected there would be two keys in the array: images.id and format.id

Am I wrong to expect that?

Thanks for any help. I am new to PHP and databases and this code I am 
using I got from a book, so maybe it is the wrong technique.

Whooops... I realize there is some stuff missing from the query and 
from the database I illustrate here. I can give you the proper code if 
needed. I had just tried to dash of a scaled down example quiet 
quickly, but I realize the code I gave makes no sense.
But maybe it doesn't affect the question in hand.. that is... how keys 
appear in an array if you have similar named fields in different 
tables. (ie. images.id, format.id)

i am not sure if this is the *right* way to do it, but off the cuff, this
should work:

$query= "SELECT
  images.id as images_id,
  format.id as format_id,
  format.name as format_name
FROM images, format
WHERE images.id=$id";

while ($row=mysql_fetch_array($result)){
$images_id = $row["images_id"];
$format_id = $row["format_id"];
$format_name = $row["format_name"];

echo "$images_id, $format_id, $format_name";
echo "<br>";
}

i added the "a.b as a_b" bits because this is what i generally do, and while
referring back to $row["a.b"] could work, if your select has just "a.b", i'm
not sure it would work in exactly that format...

I have two tables named "images" and "format"

Images has three fields: id, name, and format

Format has two fields: id, name

The "format" field in the "images"  table is linked to the "id" field 
in the "format" database

Only the column name is used as the key for the array. The table name bit is
not.  So your array keys for that query would be 'id', 'id', and 'name'.
Now the two 'id' keys are a problem as they will clobber each other in some
unknown way.  The way around them is to alias the column names in your
query, i.e.

 $query= "SELECT images.id AS imagesid, format.id AS formatid, format.name
 FROM images, format
 WHERE images.id=$id";  /* $id is a passed from a from*/

So yes, your thinking was correct.

in trouble shooting arrays try print_r($row); you will be able to see 
the keys, and data of the array..

You could try aliases the field in the sql statement, meaning select 
fieldname as aliasname.

select images.id as imageid, format.id, format.name
from images, formate
where images.id = $id";  /* look into $_POST['id'] or $_GET['id']  but 
that is beside the point */

the key to the array is the field name. never the tablename.fieldname 
unless of course you alias the field that way.. .

1- It's a good idea to use alias in the query to make it easier to read:

$query= "SELECT images.id as imageid, format.id as formatid, format.name as
formatname
FROM images, format
WHERE images.id=$id";  /* $id is a passed from a from*/

2- If you use extract, variables $imageid, $formatid and $formatname will
have the expected values. You can also use
$row["imageid"], $row["formatid"] and $row["formatname"], without having to
use extract.

3- Just a side note: If you're building the query out of data received from
the outside, take necessary precautions validating it, as well as handling
any errors in case the resulting query is bad/empty.

One backdoor to hack pages, for example, is to craft a URL to your page
passing
$id= "3; delete from mysql.user where 1=1" . If executed, this query could
do some damage to your db.

Hello,

Sorry if this is a RTFM question, but this list has been such a great
resource I wanted to start here.

Just a question about printing from an array using PHP/MySQL

My real database and code is a little more complex then this, but to
illustrate my problem let me say

1. I have two tables: "images" and "format". They each have two fields
"id" and "name".

2. I have a query that says

$query= "SELECT images.id, format.id, format.name
FROM images, format
WHERE images.id=$id";  /* $id is a passed from a from*/

3. Then I assign the results to an array using

$result= mysql_query($query);

while ($row=mysql_fetch_array($result)

             {
                         extract($row);

             }

4. Then I want to print the results which I would think would go like
this:

echo "$images.id, $format.id, $format.name";

But it seems these are not the keys in the array, but instead there is
just one $id key and the value of that is whatever "id" came last in
the query. In other words, if the query read "Select format.id,
images.id" then there would be a value in the array for $id equal to
"images.id" and if query read "Select images.id, format.id" then there
would be a value in the array for the key $id equal to "format_id".

I expected there would be two keys in the array: images.id and format.id

Am I wrong to expect that?

Thanks for any help. I am new to PHP and databases and this code I am
using I got from a book, so maybe it is the wrong technique.

Hans-

I'd recommend osCommerce (http://www.oscommerce.com/)... it is pretty complete
and has a number of well-trafficked sites running it, and most importantly, the
code is very clear.  I believe documentation is still in the works though...

phpShop (http://phpshop.org/) was looking pretty promising for a while, but
seems to have stalled almost a year ago...

I've released phpSQLGen 0.4.0 and LiquidClassifiedsXML 0.9.0.
For more information about phpSQLGen, see 
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=bb&t=2
For more information about LiquidClassifiedsXML, see 
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=bb&t=5

New in this release of phpSQLGen:
1) Added generate function to TableMaker which returns a string instead of 
sending output to the screen
2) Added XML as an output option
3) Removed PEAR HTML_Table dependency
4) Added <> format option for fields that are not displayed
5) Streamlined generation of HTML tables or XML from arrays

phpSQLGen's XML generation capability is used by the LiquidClassifieds web 
service to produce XML for the LiquidClassifiedsXML client to parse  (using 
expat).

Also, I'm looking for partners (who would run web service clients) to 
provide classified ads in New York and the surrounding areas.

Message-ID: <20020912235120.57457.qmail@web11705.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello:

I have looked at the faq and cant find the answer, all
I seem to find is the question, everywhere and no help
for stupid people like me.

I already installed php on a RH7.2 system with the
rpm. Everywhere I look says I have to  compile php
with oracle support. My question is: Since I have
oracle already installed is there a way to edit any
file like php.ini to enable oracle 8i support or do I
HAVE to compile a php in order to get it working?

Thanks in advance for your help.

You do.

I'm almost positive the RPM of PHP doesn't include oci8 support (a
phpinfo() call would confirm this).

So, you'll need to compile php with something like:
./configure --with-oci8=/home/oracle/OraHome1

with the Oracle client libs installed minimally and

/home/oracle/OraHome1/lib

in /etc/ld.so.conf.  Be sure to run ldconfig afterwards, of course, and
these are only the default Oracle directories for stuff.

You can move Oracle shared library from another server. I have a oracle.so but it was compiled with 6.2. It won't work. You need a shared library in /usr/lib/php4 for Oracle access. 

So, the quick answer is to compile. It is straightforward.

Hello again,

Thanks for all the shopping cart recommendations - it's working out
well.

Now, can I get some recommendations for Project Management Systems? 
Something akin to a web-enabled MS Project (I know there is a
web-enabled version of Project, but we don't have the budget for it
right now), and we need something as "pre-cooked" as possible (I don't
have time to develop this one at all).  Free or commercial is fine
(although the cheaper the better).

Thanks again folks,

Hans

Hello again,

Thanks for all the shopping cart recommendations - it's working out
well.

Now, can I get some recommendations for Project Management Systems? 
Something akin to a web-enabled MS Project (I know there is a
web-enabled version of Project, but we don't have the budget for it
right now), and we need something as "pre-cooked" as possible (I don't
have time to develop this one at all).  Free or commercial is fine
(although the cheaper the better).

Thanks again folks,

Hans

I've been playing with PHPProjekt 3.3 lately.  It seems pretty good.

MS Project is more like personal project schedule development tool. phpprojekt is more like schedule sharing as an intranet. It takes too much effort to get a good looking and working environments going.

In other words, both packages don't quite do the job. 

You should be able to;
1. make schedules and share with others 
2. track time
3. create discussions on event or item
4. share properties such as document and version them
5. notify others if there are changes (like by email)
6. approve and checklist (this is a hard one)

Plone (aka Zope CMS) works like this except #2, and #5. Although it is not terribly difficult. Probably a day's work. There is even collector (bug tracker) I know of a commercial one well made. I will need to get back to you with the name, Hans.

Here we go. It is an ASP model. Not cheap.

It is quite complete and I have used it with another development firm. 
It is written in Cold fusion.
It has very appealing interfaces.

Subject: HTTP_REFERER does not work - alternatives?
Message-ID: <001601c25ed5$c17b3f40$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

URL: http://valsignalandet.com/my/dummy.html
        http://valsignalandet.com/my/layout.html

Consider this:

I have this URL, dummy.html, that only has a link that you click onto that takes you to layout.html, a framed HTML document with one PHP script, layout_bottom.php.

This script, layout_bottom.php, attempts to capture the value of $HTTP_REFERER:

<?

 if (strlen($HTTP_REFERER) > 0)
  $refURL = $HTTP_REFERER;
 else 
  $refURL = $SCRIPT_NAME;

?>

However, $HTTP_REFERER is always null, even when I came from dummy.html it is still null, never receiving the previous URL value.

Does anyone else out there know an alternative to $HTTP_REFERER? I've worked with it for years and it has constantly, CONSTANTLY failed me every single time, in PHP, TCL, ASP, Java, everything!  What else can I use to retain the previous URL that calls layout.html?

Thanx
Phil

have you tried $_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"]
or $HTTP_SERVER_VARS["HTTP_REFERER"] ?
chances are, http_referer is not an auto-global.

Do you have any material in the presentation about the PHP License ? People might possibly have comments about how PHP4 is not Free Software (as described on fsf.org)  :)

The list goes out at 3:30pm sharp to IBM.  After that, you can still
attend the meeting, but you'll have to sign in like the pre-9/11 days.

If anyone has a problem (not that anyone will), we'll come down and get
you in.

PS: There's some t-shirts and other swag from Caldera tonight.

$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] should not be used.. often times user behind a 
proxy are configure not to submit http_referer

note.. rfc2616

15.1.3 Encoding Sensitive Information in URI's

   Because the source of a link might be private information or might
   reveal an otherwise private information source, it is strongly
   recommended that the user be able to select whether or not the
   Referer field is sent. For example, a browser client could have a
   toggle switch for browsing openly/anonymously, which would
   respectively enable/disable the sending of Referer and From
   information.

   Clients SHOULD NOT include a Referer header field in a (non-secure)
   HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure
   protocol.

   Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET
   based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will
   cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing
   servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some
   place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use
   POST-based form submission instead

you could store $url = $_SERVER['http_host'] . $_SERVER['request_uri']; 
as an array in your session var... or you could use a cookie by 
unserialize($cookie); push($cookie[0],$url); serialize($cookie); (or 
something like that.. ) either way you will have an array of visited 
urls.. much like the javascript history method..

Message-ID: <F9E832D44277A64EA6FB98FE9BD720FDAFFDF6@psle07.xchg.pwj.com>

Hi all!

I'm stumped.  I'm trying to send an email to one person, make it from a
departmental address, and bcc myself.  I've gotten a CC working, but it
seems to ignore the BCC header.  The code I'm using looks like this:

$to = "joe.shmoe at company.com"
$subject = "Re: foo";
$msgBody = "bar";

$headers = "From: <dept at company.com>\\r\
";
$headers .= "Cc: <dept at company.com>\\r\
";
$headers .= "Bcc: <me at company.com>\\r\
";

mail("$to", "$subject", "$msgBody", "$headers");

So, in the testing I've done, I can CC the department, and I can CC myself.
But it just seems to ignore the BCC header entirely.  I don't get any kinds
of errors or returned mail, and I don't have access to the Exchange logs.
Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks,
Tom

Yes, I realized that... I have other people creating test entries, so the
only mail I should be receiving is the BCC.  Unfortunately, I'm not getting
anything (while the To and CC addressees are).  It looks like the mailing
list removes anything in parentheses from the subject, so something that
should be mentioned is that I'm running PHP 4.2.1 on Windows NT with IIS 4.

FYI: I just learned of this (forwarded message below), and it looks
interesting.

Since I'm sending this, I'm going to toss in Whisker, which can help
find (among other things) spammer-exploitable scripts.  Many hosting
services use this now to scan nightly for customer-installed exploitable
scripts. Or so I've been lead to believe. ;)

Secure Software Inc. would like to announce the release of RATS 2.0.

RATS, the Rough Auditing Tool for Security, is a security auditing utility
for C, C++, Python, Perl and PHP code. RATS scans source code, finding
potentially dangerous function calls. The goal of this project is not
to definitively find bugs. The current goal is to provide a reasonable
starting point for performing manual security audits. RATS is released
under version 2 of the GNU Public License (GPL).


New in this version of RATS:

RATS can now descend through directories recursively, analyzing any supported
source code it finds.

Ability to output results as HTML or XML.

Result output can contain the line of code that caused each problem to be
reported, along with the column number in the source file the problem was
detected at.

RATS will now report various statistics at the end of the reporting phase,
including total time spend on the analysis, and number of source lines analyzed.


Various database additions.

A new database file, rats-openssl, which aids in analyzing any code that
utilizes the OpenSSL C API. (Thanks to Ben Laurie for contributing this
database)


To download RATS, please visit http://www.securesw.com/rats/

When I helped a client get his site onto search engines last year we found
that we needed to do several things:
1. submit the site (we used a service which I think was www.digitalwork.com)
2. include keywords that are referenced in multiple pages at the site (<meta
name="keywords" content="Construction ...).
3. make sure you have a title that you will want displayed (<meta
name="description" content="XYZ Corp. ....
4. Pepper your text with the keywords (such as "here is a list of services
provided:  Construction, Development, ...).

Remember that the browser really doesn't care if it is reading PHP, ASP, or
plain HTML, because it only sees HTML.  Just make sure that the PHP creates
the HTML that is optimized for search engine exposure.

Good luck!

Bill

Hi, I'm Donald.  I'm a web designer new to nyphp and to PHP/MySQL.  I 
really think it's exciting to see open source projects like PHP and 
MySQL become so popular!  The combination of the two provides access to 
some might powerful features to MANY people and organization who 
wouldn't ordinarily be able to afford the technology (of particular 
interest to me).  I'm looking for the community and training to bolster 
my skills in both.

I'm definitely considering going to this conference.  If there was an 
additional discount for user groups such as our own, I would buy my 
tickets this week.  Even if that doesn't happen, I think this is an 
important conference to support and attend.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Search Engine Indexable PHP Sites


Greetings,

I've developed a LAMP based online catalog for a jewelry company and for the
most part the site is great.  The problem is that nobody can tell it works
so well due, in large part to the fact that I
can't get the site indexed by the search engines.  I believe this is because
it is a dynamic site and each url on the generated pages contain references
to sub-pages using
pagename.php?variable1=value&variable2=value

I've read up on a few articles from evolt.org and searchtools regarding
"clean" urls and I have embarked on a redevelopment of the site to use urls
like

http://www.camelotbridal.com/new/index/rings/2 (keep in mind - I'm currently
working on this so don't be shocked by the debug output and random errors)

Instead of

http://www.camelotbridal.com/index.php?p=rings&c=3

My question is this:

Are there any tools that mimic the search engines indexing behavior so that
I can gauge the effectiveness of my redevelopment?

I've tried weblech and it's quite nice - builds a directory tree with the
results of a scan of my new layout.  But is weblech doing /just/ what the
spiders are?  There should be a tool that mimics
each search engine spider (google, altavista, etc)... If not, then I'm
wondering if someone knows how to get hold of the searching behaviour of the
most popular engines.  For example: Does the spider
stop when it finds a url with a "?" in it (second example above).

Mike

Just a quick question before I shoot off email to the authors, anyone

phpMyAdmin?  I could not find notes for this (im assuming it is a

You can of course copy tables from one DB to another, however I don't
remember seeing phpMyAdmin support that across servers.  Depending on
the size of the DBs, you could dump the structure/data from one, save
to a file, then reload in another (essentially copying it).  If both
DBs are already populated, you'll probably need PHP to mediate the
differences according to a spec, unless theres a big section of
phpMyAdmin I don't know about.

Hans, you may want to put the recursion discussion before the spider because the spider uses recursion--it is a natuarl prereq.
Good work on this.

Yes, I realized that... I have other people creating test entries, so the
only mail I should be receiving is the BCC.  Unfortunately, I'm not getting
anything (while the To and CC addressees are).  It looks like the mailing
list removes anything in parentheses from the subject, so something that
should be mentioned is that I'm running PHP 4.2.1 on Windows NT with IIS 4.

While test make sure the destination mailbox for the addresses are not the

I'm going to work on a site for a friend's translation company.  His
company translates technical documents in 30+ asian/european languages. 
The site will be to market his company in different countries as well as
have services for his translators.

I've just begun to look through the tutorial on internationalization at
java.sun.com as I begin thinking on the architecture of this site.  Is
there any similar documentation/tutorial online for php?

Do any of you have experience developing multilingual web sites?  If yes,
have you used JSP, PHP, or any other technology for this?

Would like to know the pro's and con's between using these technologies
for a multilingual site.

Thanks.

There's a mailing list dedicated for the project:
http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php

And the project itself:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-i18n/

I haven't done this sort of thing on this scale, but I have played
around with the php.net/recode functions a bit and some of the
different encodings.  I know that there's a few people on this list
that have used the internationalization before, too.

Subject: mkdir() failed (Permission denied) 
Message-ID: <01b001c26726$50269840$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

Ok, I am stuck.  I am trying to create a folder in the same directory as process.php and then use move_uploaded_file($FILES['myImage]['tmp_name']) and it constantly fails:

mkdir() failed (Permission denied) 

Here is my code:

<?
  $willChangeLayout = 1; $isEmptyLayoutValues = 1;

  foreach ($_POST as $key => $val) {
   if (strcmp($key, "isDefaultLayout") == 0) $willChangeLayout = 0;
   if (!empty($_POST[$key])) $isEmptyLayoutValues = 0;
   ${"$key"} = $val;   
  }

  // SERVER-SIDE VALIDATION
  if ($willChangeLayout && $isEmptyLayoutValues)
   header("Location: " . $refURL . "?errorMsg=" . urlencode("Please fill out all required fields"));

  // FILE UPLOAD HANDLING

  $attempt = mkdir("/users/ppowell/web/my/images", 0655);

  if (is_uploaded_file($_FILES['myImage']['tmp_name'])) 
   move_uploaded_file($_FILES['myImage']['tmp_name'], "/users/ppowell/web/my/images/" . $_FILES['myImage']['name']);

   
?>

Please someone tell me what I'm doing wrong :(

Thanx
Phil

That's not possible!  /users/ppowell/web/my has permissions set to 0755, I
have full write permissions onto that folder, but I can't create subfolder
/users/ppowell/web/my/images - I don't get it!

There could be a couple reasons for this.  However, most likely, is
that the Apache daemon doesn't have permission to write in
/users/ppowell/web/my/images.  I'm assuming this is a shared
environment, in which case it's rare (and good) that a daemon has write
permissions in a user's directory.  Depending on the configuration,
you'll need to chmod g+rwx /users/ppowell/web/my or chmod o+rwx
/users/ppowell/web/my (hark!).  But it's probably better to make the
directory beforehand, and then set it aside with write permissions,
ditching the mkdir() from PHP.

But be weary, because anyone using the same daemon will have write
permissions there as well (hopefully, however, the PHP is setup with
safe mode properly to surpress any potential issues).  I haven't been
in a lot of shared environments so there may be a trick to this that is
safe[r], but this is the only way around it AFAIK.  And this is why
MySQL has become popular for storing files, ahem.

So, /users/ppowell/web/my has permissions set to 0755 and I cannot create
/users/ppowell/web/my/images/ I get this error upon this line:

  if (!is_dir($path)) mkdir($path, 01755);

Warning: Unable to access /users/ppowell/web/my/images/ in
/users/ppowell/web/my/process.php on line 27

The subfolder /users/ppowell/web/my/images/ does not yet exist!!!

0755 won't cut it for /users/ppowell/web/my - you need write set on
either group or world - so /users/ppowell/web/my either needs to be
0775 or 0757, depending on whether apache is in your group or not.

Got it but the solution is derned freaky... talking to the webserver admin I
come to find out that I have to write a stub executable to php4.cgi which
will interpret the PHP script bypassing the Apache mods.. that way I can
keep the directories at the default 0755 and STILL be able to do file mkdir
and uploading!!

Well, your nasty parse error is because you have 2 opening ( and 3 closing
) on that line.

A quick way to get the very last element of a 2-d array is to use:

  echo end(end($idArray));

hey:

remember, arrays begin at zero, so you need to subtract one from the 
result of sizeof() or count() in this case.

so, your answer is:

echo $idArray[0][(count($idArray[0])-1)];

You can only set a cookie before any output is send to the browser. A
newline, space, or <html>, etc, is output to the browser. Redesign your

Phil,

You are sending output somewhere prior to the following line:

header("Location: " . $HTTP_POST_VARS["refURL"]);

Basically, as soon as you output anything, PHP has to assume you are 
finished manipulating headers.

Output can be anything from a space, newline, or HTML. It is not your 
setcookie() function but something that happens prior to that. Remember 
that everything not in PHP mode is considered output.

Subject: tools for working with mp3/ogg
Message-ID: <20020929201216.C356110DE17@carbine.dsl.net>

Hi, I'm looking for some info on the state of the art with regard to 
working with mp3/ogg files with PHP.

End goals:

--database (preferably Postgresql) holding info about a library of 
mp3/ogg files (preferably ogg)
--ability to dynamically create playlists, stream and stream 30-second 
excerpts of these files

I don't really care about the front-end user interface part of this; I'll 
write it.  I'm looking for tools to *work with* music files, both on 
building the library and as part of the backend of the website when it's 
operational - a tool to look at multiple music files and insert all of 
the interesting information (title, bitrate, length, and so on) into a 
database would be nice, for example.

I've heard of the Andromeda mp3 script, except it doesn't do nearly all 
that I need to do, and it's commercial anyway.

Some tools I'm aware of:

--apache modules like mod_mp3
--perl libraries like Apache::mp3

Anything else?

Hmmm, while I was writing this email I came across Netjuke:

http://netjuke.sourceforge.net/

which looks very interesting, so I'll have to check that out.  And 
reading the Netjuke page I see http://getid3.sourceforge.net/ , which 
looks like the perfect solution to reading in the music files.  
Excellent.  But I might as well throw this out there anyway.  :)

I'll be redesigning a website using Apache 1.3.26, PHP and MySQL on a Win Advanced Server 2K.

Is there a way to do includes for a Header, Footer and Menu with out using a .inc or .php extension?? I would rather see a .htm extensions but what can I use to get Apache to parse the file?

Apache is not using mod_php but if I can find a windows compiled module I could run it....

(I'm a newbe so be nice ;-) )

Jessica,

In your <Apache Root>conf/httpd.conf file, find and copy the line which 
looks like:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

and make an entry below it with the following

AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm

You can do that for as many extensions as you want Apache to hand off to 
PHP.

If you're wondering about the extension on the included file, that doesn't 
matter.  PHP scripts will include the file regardless of what it's called 
and take appropriate action depending on the contents of the file.

If you're interested in the extension of the file doing the include, then 
you can change that behavior in your httpd.conf or .htaccess files with 
the following directive.  Tweak it as desired for your needs.

   AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm .inc .txt .php

But, do note, if your include files are in the document root (or a
subdirectory thereof), you'll want to make them get parsed as PHP anyway,
because you most likely don't want the source code getting revealed.  So,
put the extensions of your include files in the AddType directive, above.

Enjoy,

So I could do this:

file called index.htm
(Contents of index.htm)
...
<body>
<!-- #include virtual="header.htm" ?>
<!-- #include virtual="menu.htm" ?>
Wonderful and Exciting Contents go here...
<!-- #include virtual="footer.htm" ?>
</body>
...

And it will be parsed by PHP....Right? (if I make the recommenced changes to the Apache conf file)

Will this work with the regular PHP installed or do I need mod_php??

Which would be better to use as to be less of a drain on server resources -  regular PHP or mod_php?

I've been using netjuke for quite a while for my private music
collection. It works real well, and I'm happy with it.

Not exactly.  Do this:

  <body>
  <?php
  include('./header.inc');
  include('./menu.inc');
  ?>
  Wonderful and Exciting Contents go here...
  <?php
  include('./footer.inc');
  ?>
  </body>

I strongly suggest renaming include files to use the .inc extension.  This 
will make it clear which files are for public viewing and which files are 
just internal components.

This will work either way.

In general module is better on speed, and I suspect, resources.  But, on
the windows platforms, it's said that the module version isn't up to 
production quality/stability.

If you do it like Dan said below make sure that you add the .inc to

AddType application/x-httpd-php  .inc .php

In the httpd.conf file or an htaccess file in the directory where you
header.inc file resides.  Or else it is possible to view the source code of
your *.inc files by accessing them directly.
http://www.yoursite.com/header.inc

Just my 2 cents....

We discussed the .inc issue in the last PHP meeting. To two safest solutions
are:
1. Have the .inc files outside of the web directory root.
2. Configure Apache (or .htaccess) not to display .inc files.

Doing: AddType application/x-httpd-php  .inc .php
will still enable the execution of the PHP code although the code will not
be displayed. It is not wise to allow code to be executed from remote and by
anyone.

Daniel Kushner

I've had some luck with PHP and unicode, even without explicit support for
it in the language.  I used mysql as the database backend, and used vlib
template to generate all my pages.  Unicode text would pass through all of
these unharmed, and you could even do searches containing unicode
characters.  Using a template system like vlib template, creating versions
of the site for different languages is as simple as using a different
template file.  Just make sure you put a tag in the head section of the HTML
template to set the encoding appropriately, and use some GET or session
variable to specify the language.

Depending on what level of internationalization support you need, this may
be enough.  You can get data in and out regardless of encoding so long as
you maintain consistent throughout.

I wrote my opnion before, but I think it lost in the talk at nyphp.org. I use oracle as the backend dabase,  but charset has to be set to utf8 when you create a databse, you can use this charset for all languages in oracle. There are two ways to process mitiple languages in php, one is you have two sest of codes put into two different directories. another is you can use a very very long arrary to hold all languages, then print them out depened on the "locale" variable.

Subject: Reading a PHP-as-CGI script into another PHP script
Message-ID: <00e901c268f9$f39e79f0$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

I have the following URL:

http://valsignalandet.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/ppowell/php4.cgi/~ppowell/my/style.php

This is a PHP script that is evaluated and compiled by a CGI script, php4.cgi, to allow for file and directory manipulation w/o having to change file and directory permissions to world-write.

This URL works just fine as follows:

<!--#INCLUDE VIRTUAL=http://valsignalandet.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/ppowell/php4.cgi/~ppowell/my/style.php --> 

If I place this tag inside .shtml files, the results are exactly what I want.. however, I am now required to get the contents of http://valsignalandet.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/ppowell/php4.cgi/~ppowell/my/style.php and place inside another PHP script; to date, nothing occurs.

I am able to read other CGI script inside via fopen("../mycgi.cgi", "r"); and able to read PHP via fopen("../myphp.php", "r"); with no problem.

Does anyone know of a way then that I might be able to produce the contents of a uniquely-formed URL such as http://valsignalandet.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/ppowell/php4.cgi/~ppowell/my/style.php into another PHP script since fopen and require() both do not seem to work in this case?

Thanks
Phil
