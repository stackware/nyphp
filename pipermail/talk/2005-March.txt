Have you looked at the file?

Does it seem to you like valid XML?

The first four lines are:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
- <ThML>
- <ThML.head>
- <electronicEdInfo>

Note the leading hyphens. 

The parser told you there is a problem:

Please check the obvious before posting for free assistance. 

I apologize in advance for the rant.

An update... I'm still working this one out.  The --target flag didn't

 Business (avail. at HBR Online)
Message-ID: <4224A5B6.5050802@ceruleansky.com>

Greetings fellow LAMPers and LAMPesses,

I came across an interesting article (or rather case study) about how 
MySQL was able enter the formerly impenetrable database market.
It is called (somewhat obtusely) 'MySQL Open Source Database in 2004'. 
It explores how MySQL, a once tiny company gained a foothold in the 
database market by providing an open soure 'commodity' database. Since 
this article is only available in 'protected electronic' or paper 
format, I thought I would share this summary of it with this list, since 
many people on this list use PHP and MySQL together.

There is a lot of focus on how MySQL has 'less features' than other 
database providers (such as Oracle and IBM), yet how it managed to gain 
a following among individuals and small businesses like itself. There 
are the inevitable quotes from Oracle top brass; a typical sampling: " 
Ken Jacobs, Oracle's VP of product strategy, saw MySQL as a complement 
to Oracle's DBMS and believed it would take many years before MySQL 
would be a true competitor. He formulated Oracle's official position: ' 
Technically, in terms of capabilities, MySQL is a decade or more behind 
Oracle. For example, MySQL lacks the most basic relational database 
features ... such as stored procedures, triggers and views. [...] MySQL 
[has not been useful for] the more transaction processing and business 
intelligence applications that constitute the majority of enterprise 
database deployments."

This case study was published on June 1st, 2004. One can however find 
some or all of these 'missing' features in MySQL 5 today. An excerpt 
from the mysql.com site ( 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/mysql-5-0-nutshell.html ): "New 
development for MySQL is focused on the 5.0 release, featuring stored 
procedures, views (including updatable views), rudimentary triggers, and 
other new features."

This article also presents the other side of the story, with Zach 
Urlocker of MySQL AB explaining that they "compete against 
nonconsumption". In other words, people who would not otherwise have a 
database installation use MySQL. In my experience, I often find MySQL's 
(versions 3.23 and 4.0) features more than sufficient. The only thing 
that I have really missed is enforced foreign key constraints and 
transactional / rollback support, but those features are available if 
one uses the InnoDB engine. The problem is that today, most hosting 
companies only install MySQL with MyISAM engine support, and MyISAM 
lacks these features. Then again, with careful error checking and coding 
on the PHP end, I have been able to work around this issue. Granted, if 
one is building a 500,000 user online banking system, then perhaps MySQL 
4.0 may not be the best database to choose. For for more small business 
Intranet use, or for small business e-commerce and informational 
websites, it is more than sufficient, especially when combined with PHP 
to retrieve and display its data.

The case study also mentions MySQL's alliance with (and investment from) 
SAP in 2003. SAP had this aging, yet full-featured database called SAP 
DB that was used by approximately 5% of its ERP customers. They 
partnered with MySQL so that MySQL would continue maintenance and 
support of this product, now renamed Max DB. MySQL would also continue 
development of its own product line, with a view towards making it 
'enterprise ready' / 'SAP ready' in the next three to four years. This 
alliance seems to have been mutually beneficial: "Both MySQL revenues 
and SAP DB's percentage share in SAP installations increased sharply 
since the start of the alliance in June 2003".

Regarding MySQL's business model (a.ka. "how they make money"), the 
article mentions their dual licensing scheme, where companies that want 
to incorporate MySQL into their products can purchase a commercial 
license and bypass the open source GPL license. The article (Exhibit 2) 
quotes Josh Berkus of the PostgreSQL project as saying that MySQL is 
really "shareware" and not open source. The article mentions that all 
MySQL code has been written by MySQL employees, thus enabling them to 
offer dual licensing. It then draws the conclusion that MySQL is 
"proprietary" and not open source because it owns all the code, unlike 
the case of Linux, where Red Hat, for example, does not own all the code 
itself. The main stated business benefit of MySQL open availability of 
source code is rapid market penetration and widespread testing by the 
thousands of "GPL edition" MySQL users.

There also also mentions of how MySQL is run as a "virtual organization" 
with 120 employees scattered throughout the world, many of whom work 
from their home offices. This, the article says, enables MySQL to keep 
its costs down while recruiting the best and most dedicated developers 
wherever in the world they may be - developers who have already proven 
themselves in the MySQL open source community.

The article ends on a mostly upbeat note, with a discussion of the 
possibilities for MySQL to grow from into a $100 million a year company. 
It says that while large scale success may eventually come to MySQL, 
MySQL must also be wary of the "seismic forces that could easily 
overwhelm" a small company such as MySQL. I suppose those seismic forces 
are Oracle, Microsoft and IBM.

So, as developers, what do you think? Does MySQL meet your needs 
sufficiently? Do you see it growing along with your needs? If you do not 
use MySQL, which database do you use and why? Any thoughts regarding 
IBM's new alliance with Zend to bring DB2 and Derby (Cloudscape) support 
to PHP and how this might affect MySQL's market share among PHP users?

Oracle has NEVER acknowledged the fact that on the order of 98% of
database users don't even know about the existence of most of these
features. They're "nice to have", but hardly critical for even a
relatively large db-driven application.

Oracle's great, but it's overkill for all but the most demanding
applications.

MySQL is a fantastic alternative. It takes some customization work to
make it perform very well for specific cases, but I can't complain,
since I do a fair amount of MySQL optimization analysis work. It can
be made to scale >very< well with the right attention to architecture,
configuration, and usage.

Source?  And users using only MySQL (where these features don't exist) 
don't count.

Purely speculative, from my own sampling of web and backend
application developers over the years, across at least five relational
databases other than MySQL.

Sure - many of the DBAs know about them, but most app developers, in
my experience, don't. Or, at least, they don't consider them as useful
alternatives in the general case. And, in many cases, they'd be right
- a lot of things work just fine without them.

I will never advocate Oracle for anything, but can tell you for
certain that there are many business applications that simply cannot
live without these features.

IMHO it is only certain circumstances that would dictate that you NOT
use these features.

For example, take your prototypical application for HR, where you
track employees, their vacation and benefits. With MySQL you are
forced to put all of the business rules in the application layer --
preferably PHP ;-) -- causing unneccessary duplication of effort and
providing more opportunity for error. Not to mention the added effort
of porting all that logic from the PHP web application to the .Net fat
client, or to the python server-side scripts...

Put all of the data-related logic in the database as stored procs, and
you can share that logic with any application that can connect to your
database. So the web front end is using the exact same rules as the
fat client for HR people and so on. The language used is no longer of
consequence, you are free to choose as you see fit.

> Oracle's great, but it's overkill for all but the most demanding

It's overkill for anything, even nuclear particle research. I mean,
once I populated a table with java methods as plaintext, constructed a
SELECT, compiled and executed the results of the query right in the
database. Why in the world would you need this? LOL

A very good friend of mine is working over in Jersey at a commerce
portal for retailers in the fashion industry. We are both fond of
PostgreSQL, but he is happy to stick with MySQL. His explanation is
that "as our needs and requirements grow, MySQL is growing with us.
When we will really need <feature>, MySQL will probably support it."

I want to love MySQL, I really do, but I am a huge proponent of stored
procedures, triggers and views. Until then my default answer is
PostgreSQL, which (to me at least) is MySQL with all the missing stuff
added.

The only thing keeping me from advocating _only_ PostgreSQL is the
fact that I am also a huge supporter of database abstraction for web
applications that are distributed (like Mambo), where platform
neutrality is a desperate need.

I could never have run ClassMates.Com without MySQL. With the database
on a dual P-III with the world's slowest RAID controller, I managed to
server over 1 million distinct visitors every day without mishap.
Tried on a quad alpha with four times the hardware, and didn't have a
chance. And I went through certification as an Oracle DBA just for the
exercise, so I did not just install Oracle and test against the
default, I recompiled the kernel and hotrodded the heck out of that
machine.

MySQL on the quad alpha, however, was something to behold ;-)

Ultimately, IMHO there are two FOSS databases that cover the whole
gamut of needs. If you need embedded, distributed, clustered, just
plain huge, or just plain fast... For me the combination of MySQL and
PostgreSQL has made commercial databases a non-issue.

For small cases of "sufficient".  MySQL is "good enough" and that's
important.  Most developers don't know or care about transactions,
stored procs, etc. because those things aren't "programming".  Hell,
most developers don't know how to do quality SQL.

Can you do the transactions in your code instead of on the database?
Sure.  And I can keep all of my accounting records on paper forms, but
why use archaic methods when you don't need to?

> Do you see it growing along with your needs? 

It will eventually get to be a real RDBMS and at some point, it will
read email as well.

> If you do not use MySQL, which database do you use and why? 

I like PostgreSQL but I want to play with Firebird because of what I
hear about it's transactional capabilities.

It's been my experience (and MySQL certainly encourages this approach)
that databases are frequently not reused. Obviously, I can't
generalize to all of the database usages out there - there are lots of
different patterns. But I think developers for a while have been
slowly migrating to strongly tying this kind of thing to the
applications rather than the data stores. Accessing the same data is
then not done by connecting straight to the db, but through an API
provided by the app, which enforces your model rules. This gives you
better portability to other data stores within the context of the app,
but less easy reuse of the data directly, but also a different kind of
distributed functionality.

Whether that's a good thing is arguable - I think there are tradeoffs
both ways. But it's definitely a pattern I see a lot of.

What kind of metrics are interesting to you?

I usually measure this informally as "can the database/app combination
serve all of the users of the application without unreasonable delays
or bottlenecks?" - and that depends on the application. Sometimes this
means individual query performance, sometimes it means number of
simultaneous connections, sometimes it means raw throughput.

I've actually just recently decided to offer a discrete MySQL
optimization analysis package in my consulting practice, and I'd be
curious to know what you'd find interesting in a case study.

If you're feeling kinda 'high energy', have a look at:

The LCG Persistency Framework (POOL) and distributed database 
deployment projects    
http://www.rhic.bnl.gov/hepix/talks/041019pm/duellmann.ppt  

The LCG Application Area persistency framework (POOL) at CERN 
uses (plans) a Relation Abstraction Layer (RAL) which will 
couple database back-end services like Oracle and MySQL...

Firefox is named Firefox because Firebird was Firebird before the 
Firebird that's now Firefox was.

Hope this clears things up.

In the business world I am seeing the exact opposite - each
organization, thanks to MS Access or Filemaker Pro or some such, has
data scattered about the four corners of the earth (engineering,
sales, support and HR) and a consolidation effort is slowly rising up
the priority list.

If the organization decides to commit to a particular database
platform (for whatever reason), not using all of the features
available to your advantage just makes no sense.

And in that scenario (which for my clients is a vast majority) forcing
your developers and consultants to replicate that functionality at the
application level (paying double in efforts and cost) equally makes no
sense.

Not saying this is the only valid approach mind you, just one that
cannot be discounted as a fringe scenario.

There are plenty of folks out there (myself included) that would
consider that a moot point.

Writing database-platform neutral SQL is hard in most cases, and
impossible in many others. At that point (just writing SQL calls) you
are already typically tied to a database platform, so why should you
not use what is available? Why not take advantage of the available
features if you can benefit?

As a matter of fact, the "less is more" approach of MySQL forces you
to make changes to your database design as a result. So you could
argue the opposite side of that point with just as much conviction.
;-)

And I would say that one of the patterns you are seeing is actually
the result of MySQL, where developers are 'growing up' in a world
where you cannot enforce logic at the database level and have to
duplicate that at the application layers. Since this occasionally
results in wasted resources (duplication of effort), many of these
databases end up being small islands of data instead, only available
to the one application they were written for. This may not always be a
bad situation though, but I want to stress that in many instances this
can be a very bad situation.

That is why the paired offering of MySQL and PostgreSQL is such a
perfect combination. One gives you speed and ease of use, the other
provides power and features. Both are suported on multiple platforms,
and can be accessed by a myriad of languages and environments. I say
this is the golden age of FOSS databases!

There are very strange quirks in the InterBase/Firebird libraries and PHP 
extension that make them a bit of a nuisance.  If you do try them with 
PHP, make sure to be using PHP 5.

Well, it can turn out that major portions of your database 
contain information, which is primarily read-only.

Even the niftiest stored procedure capabilities and 
transactional rollback facilities cannot be implemented  
in such a was as to use  "all of the features available" 
on read-only tables.

Being able to use compressed tables as well as (in) memory 
tables in places and transaction-safe tables only where 
you need them can be a decided advantage.
(as usual, it depends on what it is you are trying to do)

I think a lot of developers don't use the database features that they 
could because poor requirements turn limitations designed into the 
application into business rules for the database.  Some months later, 
another application is designed that is supposed to be able to play 
fast(er) and loose(r) with the data.  Now, developers need to move the 
constriants out of the database, and into the first application, so the 
DB will allow application #2 to do it's job.  Or, maybe you can handle 
things carefully in the database.

I know this bit me several times early in my career.

PHP isn't the only language I use. ;-)  Since I will be looking at the
Ajax technology (XHTML, CSS, JS, and one or two languages on the
backend), PHP will probably come in to play, though.

Thanks for the heads up.

In my view, IBM understands how to make money implementing real FOSS 
solutions. As the issues surrounding MySQL licensing continue to evolve 
in favor of the commercial side, they may be right about an oppty for 
another truly FOSS db.

Is there anyone here who's ever built a site using PHP with Universe/DB2 on
the backend instead of, say, MySQL?

PHP related stuff in SecurityFocus Newsletter #290

I must say PHP has become very popular.  Of all the web
applications mentioned in SecurityFocus' lists of
vulnerabilities, there are FAR more mentions of apps using
PHP than any other language.  The low barrier to entry
has a downside, eh?

While I haven't built a site using it, I have used it during my 
development of PEAR DB.  It works like a charm via the odbc driver.
http://pear.php.net/package/DB

If you're curious about any quirks it may require, see my presentation 
about database portability:

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0503021711200.79595@emra.pair.com>


A little theoretical question to which I *know* you guys know the
answer so don't be coy (-:

The fgets() function documentation says:

string fgets ( resource handle [, int length] )

Returns a string of up to length - 1 bytes read from the file pointed to
by handle. Reading ends when length - 1 bytes have been read, [...]

How come it's length - 1? My research suggests the answer is, because it
PHP'wraps  fgets() a C function of the same name which does it that way.

OK then, why does the C function fgets() do it that way? I heard a rumor
that says the C function appends a NULL character to the string, so that
might explain it -- to leave some room. But if so, why the null character?

Gratefully,

Silly guess here, but a string in C is an array of characters terminated
with a null.  The null marks the end of the array.  C does not, AFIK, have
a native string type.  I think C just has arrays of characters that are
used as strings.  I remember writing functions to handle arrays of
characters like a string.  Could be total wrong here, been a long while.

Hey David,

C uses Null Terminated strings. This means that a string can contain 
any character except for NULL. Like other non-printable control 
character such as BELL, TAB, etc...

Check out this link for a better explanation : 
http://www-ccs.ucsd.edu/c/charset.html#null-terminated%20string

Okay, since you guys suggested I run my root commands from a daemon,
I've been playing with that for the past couple of days.  I stole^W
copied one of the perl daemons listed in "perldoc perlipc'
(http://www.linuxnj.com/personal/qui_server.pl) and I used the sample
PHP client from the website manual
(http://www.linuxnj.com/personal/qui_client.php).

If I manually telnet to the daemon and give the commands "ls" and
"quit", the daemon responds with a dir listing and quits. When I try to
do the same thing via the PHP client, I get a dir listing and then it sits
there.  

I've made every modification I can think of and nothing makes the PHP
client work like the manual (telnet) client.  I Assume there is
something about sockets I don't grok, but every example I've seen of
this in different languages is what I have working manually.

What am I missing?

Nothing large, but it's a direction we're going in for a few internal web 
applications. 

>From an administration point of view, it's fairly simple to add DB2 
support to PHP.  Just add the following flag to your PHP configure after 
you've installed DB2 on the server:

--with-ibm-db2 [assuming the default location, /home/db2inst1/sqllib]

Then add this to apachectl or the profile of the user who starts Apache or 
which ever web server you're planning to use:

. /home/db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile

People,

After hearing so much about MAMBO, I decided to install it on my WAMP system.

The reality of the installation is different.  I can see why peopl ewoul dget turn off about
installing this product.  I started the installation and I could not even get pass STEP 1 of the 
installation.  It kept telling me that th username and password that created was wrong.
OK, so I went to the forum and I found out that you have to use old_password() function
in order for your password to work.  OK, I got pass STEP 1 all the way to STEP 4.  In  STEP 4
I get to choose to "View Site" or "Administrator".  "View Site" displays the default MAMBO site.
If I choose ADMINISTRATION, it asks for my username and password, which is display on STEP 4,
and when I enter the username and password it tells me that they are incorrect....Hey, the
MAMBO system on STEP 4 is telling me to enter this in the ADMINISTRATION page.

Anyways I am frustrated, becuase is not working and Iafter reading the forum it seems that a lot of
people are having the same problemss.

Anybody has fixed the problem of "usernma or password incorrect" when attempting to login into
the administration area?

Which I was living in NY so that I could attend the MAMBO talk from last month.

Thanks,

Nestor ;-)

Message-ID: <42275869.5070809@iifwp.org>

Hi Folks,

Here's a surprising phenomenon I'm getting when using transparent 
session IDs, one that makes no sense to me.  Here are two hyperlinks on 
the same page, as they are originally coded:

> <a href="index.php?template=welcome&amp;submitid=32:67">Home</a> |
> <a href="logout.php?template=welcome&amp;submitid=32.67">Sign Out</a> | 
>
Now, if we use transparent SIDs, PHP will transform these like so:

> <a href="index.php?template=welcome&amp;submitid=32:67">Home</a> |
> <a href="logout.php?template=welcome&amp;submitid=32.67&amp;PHPSESSID=7e647029bccb9d34fc0b0b0aa6e6a5d0">Sign Out</a> | 
>
Notice that the first link doesn't get the form_Session argment added on 
to the URL -- only the second one.  How come?  It's the colon.  The 
colon in "submitid=32:674105001109864182" apparently screws up PHP's 
attempts to insert the session ID into the URL.  If you just take out 
the colon, you're fine; but use a colon and it's no dice.

I also tried using "&#58;" instead of an actual colon, and I get even 
crazier results.  PHP inserts the SID argument in the *middle* of the 
URL just before the "&#58;" entity, like so:

><a href="index.php?template=welcome&amp;submitid=32&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=7e647029bccb9d34fc0b0b0aa6e6a5d0#58;67">Home</a>


Seems like a bug, but I couldn't find anything on it (bugs.php.net, 
google).  Is this just weird, or am I missing something? (Experience 
shows that it's more often the latter than the former...)

Dang typos...

Line after second example is supposed to say: "Notice that the first 
link doesn't get the PHPSESSID argment ..."  (Worked on this with PHPLib 
first and then in a bare-bones script to double-check before sending. So 
much for double-checking....)

That's an HTML entity.  Try the url encoding, %3A, instead.

Doh, okay that did it. But why would PHP not handle the literal ':' the 
way I expected? It's a reserved character in a URI, isn't it? 
[googlegoogle... yep.]

As I said, it usually turns out that I was "missing something". :o)

Tell you what, I will help you figure this out, but you need to give
me some information so my guesses are more like educated guesses ;-)

What do you mean, were you giving the installer a bad mysql username,
or did you create the admin user with a password that you cannot
recall?

Knowing what version Mambo you are trying is also a big plus.

And I wish you could have made the presentation from last month, as I
would have loved to walk everyone through the installation of Mambo,
on either Windows or Linux platform.

Mitch,

Thanks for your reply.

I have MANBO 4.5.2 installed and now is just a matter of learning it.

The problems I had was that as soon as I started the installation STEP 1 failed.  
it kept saying that "the username or password is incorrect", now I am the one 
that creates the user and password in my MYSQL DB.  I found thru the MAMBO 
forum that it is a common problem and the solution was that when giving the 
GRANT command in MYSQL I need to use the functionold_password() when 
identifying the password.. that worked.
The second problem was that on STEP 4 it tell me to go the administration site 
of MAMBO and use "admin" as the user and a password created by MAMBO, but
when ever I did that it gavea message "Incorrect user name or password" .
Well I got tire of that crap and I went into the administration/index.php or common.php
and I foced it to accept my password.

Voila, everything is working but I just thing that it shouldd be easier to install.
TO me it seems that the people set up everything to have an easyu installation but
it seems as they have not updated the installation of they fail to look at some
possible installation problems.

Well, now I will have one of my coworkers take a look at MAMBO to see if we
can use it in the our H.S. district since our budget is getting slashed.

Thanks for your reply.

PS:  I could not make it to your presentation because I am a bit far from NY,
       I live in San Diego California.  We do have a php User group here but is
       not as active as yours.  the last time we met was in November.

There's a big article on iConnect in this months PHP-Architect. Has anyone
had any practical experience with it?

Writing application frameworks is becoming almost as common as writing
template engines. BTW, I don't think Flexy constitutes a framework.

Sajith,

MVC with PHP is a challenge I am trying to solve.  I tried to implement
phpMVC under Windows XP/IIS and couldn't get it to work.  I then used some
code from Chapter 13 of Professional PHP 5 by Lecky-Thompson, Eide-Goodman,
Nowicki and Cove (Wiley Publishing).  While I could get this to install
under XP/IIS, it did not perform as documented in Chapter 13.  I then
re-installed under Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP (XAMPP distribution).  Again, I
could get it to install, but it did not perform as documented (identical to
XP/IIS installation).  I have been in touch with the publisher, but received
no response.

I have seen arguments on both sides of the PHP/MVC argument.  No doubt the
amount of code is greater with MVC patterns and for simple systems I have
seen an argument against it.  On the other hand, initially simple systems
tend to grow in complexity over time, so the additional effort can be
justified in many cases.  I have had an experience where a very advanced
client/server system did not employ the kind of segmentation that would
allow it to be migrated to the web environment.  The investment in that
effort was lost.

Hope some of this helps.

Phil

I could not wake up and face the day without MVC, or whatever bastard
version of the pattern I happen to be using. Not only is it possible
with PHP, it's highly recommended for maintainability (and therefore
security).

I don't buy the argument that more code is involved, at least not for
any system more complex than a simple weblog. Writing a framework to
take care of the infrastructure of parsing and responding to HTTP (or
whatever) requests allows you to concentrate day to day on business
logic and display routines.

I think that, like a CMS, your choice of framework is highly
subjective. Unless you fall in love on first sight you will probably
end up writing your own.

I would say MVC would most definitely be advisable. However, I would 
employ MVC more as a technique to adhere to for whatever framework you 
end up using, whether it be custom or someone else's. Just like you've 
probably never designed a database that reached 5th level 
normalization, you probably won't get a perfect separation of Model, 
View and Controller code. But employing the MVC design pattern, and 
design patterns in general, will make things easier to maintain and 
make changes to.

What Brent is nicely trying to say is MVC is not a framework. It is a
methodology or technique.

JAVA has the best frameworks for enterprise development like Jboss, It would
great for PHP to have a robust application framework that was in standard
use and distributed with the language.

There's a strong argument that PHP itself is a framework, and that 
anything you build on top of it is a meta-framework.

I'm a newbie to AMP, but I've on teams where they were using Apache 1.3x 
and PHP 4.x.

What is the most stable version of Apache and PHP to run together?

Would you recommend Windows or Linux?  When (what volume of transactions) 
would I really have to consider between Windows or Linux?

Thanks.

This is always a hot topic of discussion, but at the end of the day, most will probably agree that the latest 1.3.x of Apache and latest 4.x of PHP is the most stable.  I've also had good luck with PHP 5.x, but there's a lot of new code in there, so it's just not as mature as 4.x.

> Would you recommend Windows or Linux?  When (what volume of transactions)

I'd of course go with Linux or FreeBSD, and a UNIX will almost always be more efficient that a Windows.  That said, there are a lot of people deploying very large systems on Windows, and it does work fine.  If you have the system administration know how in house, go with a UNIX.

Thanks Hans!  I'll probably stick with Windows, Apache 1.3x and PHP 4.x.

i believe PHP is a sort of framework but it's not an OO framework, i
think php should move itself to be more OO and it would be considered
a framework, i mean rather than mysql_fetch_array it could be
something like DB->MySQL->FetchArray() DB->MsSQL->FetchArray() all of
which is possible to do by writing abstraction layers but a out of the
box solution that was the standard for php would be great :D

Besides the fact that this particular example is covered entirely by 
PDO (new db interface layer becoming standard in 5.1), why does 
everything need to be OO?  I like OO as much as the next guy (at least 
as much as some next guys), but I have yet to see many examples that 
demonstrate where a lack of an OOP access pattern to some core PHP 
facility is really, truly, insurmountably less usable than the 
procedural way.

Well, I wasn't going to get involved in this discussion, but since 
George threw his hat in, I have to back him up.

I agree with George. OO is a great way to keep things organized and 
modular, but I'm not thrilled with "everything" being OO for no 
particular reason.

It is ironic that it is going this way, as I met Rasmus at the BOF at 
Linuxworld in 1999 (I believe it was then, there was only six or seven 
of us there), and he specifically said that he DIDN'T believe PHP needed 
OO, which was why it wasn't truly implemented back then. In hindsight, I 
can't say I totally agree, as I think having the OO functionality is a 
good thing. But, who does the "Java-esque" syntax and features of PHP5 
really benefit?

I think the java-esque syntax and features in php5 benefit the people 
who like OOP.  PHP3/4's OO model was built by people who didn't like 
OOP and didn't really want it in the language.  And it shows.  PHP5's 
support is nice, imho.  It adds a number of 'standard' OOP features 
that people who like to use OOP expect and appreciate.  I like where 
PHP5's OOP support is going because it (again, imho) keeps along the 
lines of 'A language with good OOP support' and not 'A good OOP 
language'.  That's a fine semantic difference that means alot to me.

PHP developers who have "grown up" with the language really need to
know about the best uses for these features, because they aren't
immediately obvious.

Interfaces, for instance, have the potential to make a lot of open
source PHP applications more modular. Don't like the database layer
that ships with that CMS? Drop in another class that implements the
same interface. Don't like the authentication mechanism? Drop in a
class that implements the same interface, but authenticates to LDAP
instead of a local database.

If the developers have done their job and stuck to the declared
interface, it will all "just work".

Unfortunately, I think we're years away from having a standard
collection of useful, well-defined generic interfaces that developers
would be willing to implement in their classes and use in their
applications. I'd love to see NYPHP leading the way on this, but as
with everything else, finding the time and expertise to put it
together is difficult.

Isn't this some of the case argued for STL in C++? If it's a similar case at
all, then, like C++, it could be 15+ years before all the interfaces can be
defined, ratified and developed.

Just food for thought. My experience is that most programmers, me included,
use only minimal features as provided by OO - primarily inheritance.
Everything else is still GOPP (Good Ol' Procedural Programming) wrapped in
methods and members. Your mileage may vary :)

brings back painful memories.

When introduced as a solution, C++ IOStreams were breathtaking in 
concept. But implementations that worked were just as proprietary as 
anything else (my perspective anyway). I gave up with it all after too 
many hours juggling the "stable" outdated MFC (no templates), the Draft 
ANSI standard (emerging STL), and  the fact that  comercial products at 
the time  handled the problem by picking ONE compiler  to support  (in 
my case it was.... WATCOM !).

I think the solution is to be the boss. That way you can define the 
interface and all the code will always work with it :-)

Sajith,

A reasonably good MVC architecture, named Seagull, is here:

http://seagull.phpkitchen.com/

It is developed as a full blown CMS. I didn't want to submit entirely
to it's means of taking care of content, but I found the design and
flow to be very nce. After figuring out how it worked, I stripped it
down to the barebones, and began developing custom modules for it.

I'll back up Alex when it comes to the Flexy templating system. The
forementioned architecture uses them, and man, it couldn't make
separating Busines logic from presentation any easier. It's reasonably
quick to learn too.

Thank you Joseph for your time.  I've heard before that Prado is
inspired by tapestry and dotnet's component model. After seeing the
code which involves xml parsing heavily, i doubt whether it will pose
any performance overheads.  I also doubt how much help will caching do
to increase performance in a web application having dynamic data.

Thank you

The PHP link above doesn't seem to be alive so it's hard to tell without any code.  Probably an error in the way you're working with the sockets as you say.

True.  I've since gotten a new perl server/daemon and am playing with

While searching for frameworks i came across this link.
http://wact.sourceforge.net/index.php/MvcFrameworksWrittenInPhp
Quoting....
-------------------------
One difference between the Java based Struts[MVC framework] and PHP is
the way in which http request dispatch is accomplished. Struts uses an
XML file to map http requests onto Java objects and PHP ports of
Struts must also construct such a mapping. In Struts, the objects that
represents this mapping are persistent in the java virtual machine
between requests. In the PHP ports, no state is retained between
requests. This means that the mapping is reparsed or reloaded on every
request. This adds a per request processing overhead to using this
FrontController pattern in PHP which does not exist in Java.
(Actually, java pays for the overhead in RAM usage instead of CPU
usage.)
-------------------------

I was having a similar doubt in my mind. Will caching the parsed xml
in someway help to improve the performance.

Intersting to see that  Ben Ramsey is giving a presentation in
International PHP Conference 2005  - "Framing the Frameworks: What Are
They and Do I Need One? " But that will be in may only. He has also
asked for case studies here .
http://benramsey.com/2004/11/29/case-studies-for-php-based-frameworks/.
it would have been really helpful if he had shared some info in his
webside before may.

I hope many people here have developed medium to large scale apps in
php. Have you people personally used  any open-source frameworks or
did u make one of your own? - and was it mvc.

Thanks and regards.

it is an object oriented framework, basically a collection of classes
and functions that you use.  Object oriented code is great for code
reuse, if designed properly you can use the same function over and
over for many things and more functons are not needed.

Ah, I'm not really that really great at writing anything oo so I guess
I should focus on that before I get into pre-built frameworks.

I am not 100% sure what a framework is.

It seems to me that a framework is a set of reusable 
software components which can be readily used to solve a 
class of problems. 

I don't think object oriented design is involved as a 
requirement for a set of components to be considered 
a framework.

If I were inclined to complain to companies about this any more, I'd
simply inform them that the only inconvenience is theirs -- losing my
business.

What's the point of having an opinion on it?  They've cut off roughly 
13% of their potential users.  Hopefully (for them) they weighed their 
options before they did so.  In their case, it seems that they used 
DRM'd media that's only supported on Windows.  Whether or that was a 
stupid decision on their part is their own calculus.  Us debating the 
wisdom of it is rather pointless.

Another good and simplest example of MVC architecture is
"class.rFastTemplate.php". Follow below link
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4573 Maybe many programmers are familiar
with this.

Message-ID: <422C7FEE.9020405@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I find PHP-GTK to be very cool, but very difficult to install on Linux. 
It was, in contrast, very easy to install on Windows.

I have written up a detailed tutorial on how to do it on Xandros Linux 
2.0 (Debian-based).

I did this to spare myself (and others) the agony of trying to compile 
it without knowing what all the requirements and procedures all.
Also - PHP-GTK 1.0.1 has a nasty bug that results in make errors unless 
it is patched before the configure stage.

These details, and more can be found at:

Maybe OT but I don't think so.

WordPress recently updated to 1.5 and it is a well-liked FOSS PHP/MySQL 
app.

Lately various users have been noting system-level problems, including 
high CPU load and large numbers of simultaneous MySQL connections, and 
several bloggers have been dumped by their hosts due to resource abuse 
on shared servers.

The developers are discussing the issue and from the latest posts that 
comment on how hard PHP canbe to debug (see the bottom of the page), I 
am betting they could use a wee bit of the high-powered NYPHP LAMP 
expertise  I see up here every week.

Anybody care to help "solve the problem" ?

Two choices. Rewrite the SQL to make this cheaper. Or, instead of
pulling the data new for every request, generate the data on a fixed

OK, so I was reading this post and I have a feeling that my question can 
be answered as an ongoing continuation of this post.

I understand Object Oriented Programming in places such as a daemon, or 
when you're writing a game in java that constantly continues to run.

But I don't understand the use of Object Oriented Programming in 
scripting.  Once the page is loaded, a new instance of any object you've 
created must be re-created (unlike java where you can create a game and 
constantly interact with the same data set).

So my main question is:  Why do people use object oriented programming in 
websites?

Thanks! :)

There's a several reasons to use OOP for web applications.  For one, it 
matches model-driven development, which means you can put together a 
wireframe or workflow of what your site will do and use objects to 
represent the actors (Customers, Products), and methods to represent their 
actions (checkOut, logIn).  If you're working with clients or business 
teams who aren't technical, these concepts benefit them by modeling their 
rules and requirements and benefit you by providing a skeleton for the 
code you must write.

An added benefit of OOP is the inherent organization that it provides you. 
 If you must later add a new bit of functionality, it should be obvious to 
you - or any new team members that you might hire during the maintenance 
or development of the application - where that new code should go.

The reason that one would use OOP when building a web app in PHP isn't for 
technical advantages such as performance or persistence, it's about 
writing maintainable and flexible code that mirrors your clients' changing 
business needs.

Daniel -

That's a very helpful response ... I've been trying to grasp the
advantages of OOP in websites for quite some time now, and that has
shined some light on the issue for me.

Thank you.

I would also like to note that if you combine OOP and sessions you
dont have to re-create each object.  for my members area i created a
user class that is stored in the users session, based on each page
load it checks to see if the session is set, if so it continues if not
it creates a new object and set's it to session, something like this

include('classfile.php');
session_start();

if( isset( $_SESSION['user'] ) ) {
  $user = &$_SESSION['user'];
} else {
  $user = new User();
  $_SESSION['user'] = &$user;
}

then you can use $user throught your application and it will update
the session object as you use it :D

This causes less overhead of having to re-create the object and to
store all data into the db with each page load.  You can go through
several pages, then in the end store the data from the object.

Hi Matt,

the following new book lists a lot of good reasons for using 
object-oriented programming with PHP:
PHP 5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice
http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=358

Even though this book is about how to use objects and patterns in PHP 5, 
the author explains on numerous occassions how the object-oriented 
version of something can save you from duplicating code, or improving 
the readability of your code.

With PHP you can put a functional / procedural interface on top 
instantiated objects, as you do not have to have a 'main' method as in 
Java. In other words:

require 'happy_funcs.php';
require 'moodBrightener.class.php';

$person = 'Fred';
if (  person_is_unhappy($person) )
{
    $mints = new moodBrightener('mints');
    $mints->makeHappy($person);
}

Often, it is not so much a matter of saving computer resources, but 
saving human resources. Some OOP techniques can help to ,modularize 
chunks of code, and establish relationships between them. And unlike 
functions, classes can 'borrow' or inherit functionality from other 
classes. So this saves you from copying and pasting code.

I hope this somewhat generalized example makes sense.

- Jay

Apologies in advance for posting with nothing valuable to say, but I

Thanks Chris, but for the record, I swapped in "flexible" for "extensible"

My client's site is all Cold Fusion right now (been writing / maintaining it
for about 5 years now), but some things are just far more efficient with PHP
and since the traffic is growing exponentially, I'd like to utilize the best
of both worlds.

 

I just converted the database from SQL Server to MySQL since I'm far better
at tweaking with MySql.  I figure I can put the sessions in the database and
carry them over between the two.  Probably CF Client Variables and a custom
session handler in php, I suppose.

 

This job is nearing it's budget limits, so I'd rather use something already
in use rather than take the time to write something.  Have any of you ever
done this or know of any libraries that exist for this?

 

(PHP 4.3.1 and CFMX 6.1 on IIS using MySql 4)

 

Thanks!

If the data you are trying to pass between PHP and CF is "secure data", 
then in my opinion you can create a table with two fields ...

md5String md5, name varchar(32), value varchar(64)

Then just have a redirect.php and a redirect.cfm ... redirect.php checks 
for a variable called action, labelled IN or OUT.  If action is IN, it 
stores the data in session, takes the md5 string of something, and passes 
that along to redirect.cfm with action=OUT, which takes the info out of 
the table, and sets a new session.  The redirect.cfm does the same thing, 
except it inserts the data into the table and then passes on to 
redirect.php.

HTH,

Matt

Message-ID: <6.1.0.6.2.20050308120518.05c3bdf8@127.0.0.1>

Hello NYPHP,

I've got a page that works totally fine for me. Takes a few seconds to load 
on cable connection with IE 6 PC. Works fine for a colleague with DSL on 
the Mac (not sure which browser). But for the most important person 
(client!) the page is taking over a minute and a half to load. He's on Win 
XP and IE (probably 6) with cable connection.

Relevant details are below. Basically, there's a table of shows, a table of 
bands, and a table that connects the two so you know which bands are 
playing in which shows. The admin chooses a show and sees a list of about 
500-1000 bands with the current bands for that show already checked. The 
admin can uncheck them, check others, etc, and update the show.

Any ideas if the slowness in loading might be due to the select statement? 
Is there a more efficient query structure? Or maybe just writing the 1000 
form inputs is taking too long? I was thinking about getting rid of the 
show/band array table and just adding 10 fields to the show table: 
band1_fid, band2_fid, etc... That would probably speed things up, but all 
the work was already done for the current  method and it works totally fine 
(except too slow for the client)...

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

Harvey


$show_id is a passed variable

music_bands:  (List of bands)
band_id
band_name

music_show_bands_array: (Keeps track of which bands are in which shows)
s_b_id
show_fid
band_fid

SELECT music_bands.band_id AS id, music_bands.band_name AS band, 
music_show_bands_array.s_b_id AS inthere
FROM music_bands
LEFT JOIN music_show_bands_array ON ((music_show_bands_array.band_fid = 
music_bands.band_id) AND (music_show_bands_array.show_fid = $show_id))
ORDER BY music_subcats.subcat_name ASC

Then there's a form with about 500-1000 bands listed as follows:
<?php do { ?>
<input name="band_fid[]" type="checkbox" value="<?php echo 
$row_bands['id']; ?>" <?php if ($row_bands['inthere']) { echo " checked"; } ?>>
<?php } while ($row_bands = mysql_fetch_assoc($bands)); ?>

Why are you looking at code changes when the problem is obviously with
the client's computer/connection?  

You should find out what the problem is before you start fixing it.

Same thing happened to the client's assistant in a different location on a 
different system.

Maybe both their connections are slow. Can't change that. But I can change 
the code if that will help.

Different machine, but probably on the same network and using the same 
route over the Internet to/from your server.  Have them run trace 
route:

win:    tracert www.servername.com
other:  traceroute www.servername.com

I would first start troubleshooting where the problem is. Put some 
timers in your code that gets displayed on the web page so you can see 
what piece took the longest time. I assume you are using some sort of 
output buffering, which will allow you to see how long it takes to 
actually deliver the result from the server to the client. I always 
build up my web page in a variable, then I have a single echo at the 
end of my code that delivers it to the client.

If you are not using output buffering, then network latency may be 
what's killing you. If you are delivering the web page piece meal, 
which it looks like what you are doing, you are probably using far more 
network packets than should and not taking advantage of http 
compression. You can do a trace route to your clients ip address to get 
an idea of network latency. Remember, cable is a share connection, so 
if there are lots of people with cable modems in your clients 
neighborhood, there may be lots of collisions. The more network packets 
you require to deliver your data, the more likely it is there will be a 
collision.

My recommendation is to change you code so you are storing everything 
in a variable, then echo the variable when you have everything. That 
will probably speed everything up considerably.

Without digging into their queries, schema, and code, it's probably one or more of these things:

-- poor indexing
-- poor use of the MySQL database handle
-- poor programming; perhaps they are copying around large arrays/objects
-- recursive queries; throwing hundreds of queries at the database that could be done with a simple join (probably the result of a programming error or bad design)

It's hard to say without knowing more.  Feel free to invite them on the list and provide some details (where the resource bottleneck is, MySQL or Apache?).  I'm sure it'd be a great learning experience for us all.

Message-ID: <20050308213919.011AF99B2@mailrelay.t-mobile.com>

I?ve done this, albeit ?asynchronous,? meaning that folks were logging into a CF application and I wanted them to be authenticated securely on a remote PHP server.

When the user logged in at the CF site, a single line of CF code did the trick, and ?called-ahead? to the PHP application.  I forget the exact syntax in CF, but it was something like this:

<cfhttp request=http://my.php.site.com/protected/preauth.php?sessionid=kdj39ks932k98s>

The protected/ directory was protected by IP restrictions, and not linked to from anywhere.  The sessionid was a md5 hash.

So, naturally, the user would login on the CF side, which would call ahead to the PHP application.  This was only done once, since all I needed to do was keep track of whether they?ve authenticated or not, and it was asynchronous, that is the PHP application never called back to CF.

But the same principal could easily be applied and expanded upon.  For instance, both the CF and PHP applications would have hidden pages, and object/arrays/etc could be serialized or converted to GET/POST/cookies to transport the information.  Simply forming your own HTTP requests would give you a lot of flexibility ? you could even imbed the information into the HTTP header if you wanted.  You could use XML for this, but I don?t really see any advantage, unless your session data is extremely complex, which it shouldn?t be any way ?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Maintaining sessions between PHP and CFs

My client?s site is all Cold Fusion right now (been writing / maintaining it for about 5 years now), but some things are just far more efficient with PHP and since the traffic is growing exponentially, I?d like to utilize the best of both worlds.

I just converted the database from SQL Server to MySQL since I?m far better at tweaking with MySql.  I figure I can put the sessions in the database and carry them over between the two.  Probably CF Client Variables and a custom session handler in php, I suppose.

This job is nearing it?s budget limits, so I?d rather use something already in use rather than take the time to write something.  Have any of you ever done this or know of any libraries that exist for this?

(PHP 4.3.1 and CFMX 6.1 on IIS using MySql 4)

Thanks!

No, but it guards you against "attacks." :)

While prepare/execute should solve most issues, I always strictly check 
incoming data.  If the column is an integer, I make sure the data only 
contains integers and isn't too long.  Etc...

This is not a slow connection problem unless every page on your site 
loads slow for them. You could test by making a very simple, text/plain 
page with as much content as your bands/shows page and seeing if they 
download it faster. But I think I know what's going to happen (it will 
load fast). If it does load slowly, they have bigger problems.

Nor do I think it's a problem with your code, unless you are generating 
bad HTML (have you validated it?). The browser doesn't see the php, only 
the HTML. And if it goes fast for you, the php part is fast. I suspect a 
table-rendering issue with their browsers, or maybe they have some funny 
filtering setup that scans big pages slowly, or whatever (they, 
hopefully, should be able to tell you what the "whatever" might be). Or 
maybe (like most Windows computers out there) they're crammed with 
viruses and spyware and ... In any case, most likely it's on their end 
and changing your code won't fix it, unless you can remove all HTML 
tables from the generated page and/or you're sending bad HTML.

First, test the connection by having them download a large, but simple 
page. Second, validate the HTML your code generates. If it validates 
your code is good, or good enough. Third, Firefox is free. Ask them to 
install it and try your (validated) pages with Firefox. Or, if they 
don't want to install Firefox, have them update IE to exactly the 
version you're using, or something newer (check to verify what they're 
actually using--you're not sure, right?).

Note: I am more of an admin than a programmer. If that was my network, I 
would assume something was wrong on my end and take responsibility for 
it. I sincerely believe that your responsibility here is to generate 
valid HTML (unless they specified otherwise :-)), and anything else is 
their problem. Maybe that's difficult in some way, but you shouldn't be 
afraid to say it. If there's something wrong over there, they should 
know about it.

Good luck,
Matt

Hello Matt,

Thanks for the note. I loaded the page in my browser, copied the source, 
and uploaded that for the client to test.

As far as table rendering, there really shouldn't be an issue since the 
page is just one table with maybe half a dozen rows, one or two columns max.

I'll try validating my html, but I doubt there are any major issues with 
it; the page is pretty simple, just pretty big.

I doubt I can get the client to use Firefox, but probably can get them to 
upgrade their IE to version 6.

Daniel earlier suggested that even though the client and assistant are on 
different machines, they're "probably on the same network and using the same
route over the Internet to/from your server. Have them run trace route." 
But actually the client and his assistant are at two different companies, 
different machines, networks, etc. Unless of course they are in the same 
building and are sharing the same connection, which I guess is possible. 
I'll check.

With some tips from Brent, I implemented a potential fix that he suggested 
earlier, "My recommendation is to change you code so you are storing 
everything in a variable, then echo the variable when you have everything. 
That will probably speed everything up considerably." Still waiting for the 
client to test and get back to me.

Rahmin suggested breaking up the long form with the list of bands into a 
few smaller pages, but the client already complains that there are too many 
pages to click through.

So, that's where I am right now...

Thanks to everyone for their help so far.

Harvey

This had crossed my mind.  As a matter of fact, I'm using similar means to
clock my MySQL queries (currently with adodb's logger and performance
functionality).  And if I didn't have control over the CFAdmin, this is most
likely the way I'd go.

I had this notion that there had to be a way to use the session data across
languages.  After all, it's all just data stored *somewhere on the server.

Well, Cold Fusion 'Session' variables are stored in RAM, with no options to
store them in a database.  This wouldn't do.

It turns out though, that their 'Client' scope (which is meant for prolonged
client session vars - server side) can be stored in the database AND can be
made to act like their session variables (expiring upon browser close).

I chose my db, it created the tables and now every session carries a record
in my database with a # delimited list of values (no structures, although I
could probably WDDX something together if I gave a damn about complexity).

Just as well, a CFID/CFTOKEN pair is given to every browser (or added to
links should cookies be disabled).  So I use that cfid cookie / param,
search the CF client's database for the user's session and viola.

I've been doing it in a very basic manner thus far.  I'm sure I'll write
some sort of session handler for it one of these days - time permitting, but
for now I'm all set.

Best of all, it was a quick and easy solution without having to build /
replace any internal functionality.  I can update the CF client variables
via sql calls and when the user returns to a CF page the cookie will be
there so the session will remain active.  I'll probably have to add
CFID/CFTOKEN's to url's for non-cookie setups...

Ok, now back to my 'explains' and query tweaks.

Thank you all for your great responses!

Mark

BTW, for this project I was lucky enough to have everything on one server.
Were it separate servers I can guarantee I would have gone the way Hans did.
That or some sort of Single-Sign-On application if the budget would allow

Harvey,

If you have phpMyAdmin on that server run your SQL queries with the 
COMMAND "EXPLAIN" in front of your SELECT Queries. Make sure your have 
the proper indexes on the tables.

Someone previously suggested copying all output to a variable then 
transmitting it to the browser.  This will increase the speed of your 
page loading.  There will be a slight pause on request but then it just 
flows in.

500 - 1000 form items is quite a bit of formatting for the browser so 
make sure all formatting is done via CSS. It's one setting for all 
TABLES, TRs, TDs, INPUTs.

Good Luck,
John Nunez

Ok, well, I think the problem is somehow Yahoo's (the client's host).
The load times for the page have been totally erratic, and so have the form 
submit times.
I just copied the page and relevant database tables to a Dreamhost account 
I have.
Voila! Everything runs perfectly fast now. Not even 2 seconds to load or 
form submit.
Seems like it might be something screwy with the Yahoo mysql server or even 
web server.
Not sure, but that's what it seems like to me?

You may want to add a no cache directive to the header, to see if the

Eric (or anybody else who might contribute),

I appreciate your suggestion about Seagull.  I have accessed the
documentation and it appears to be exactly what I was looking for.  I have
downloaded seagull-0.4.0dev1.tar.gz and looked into the Install Instructions
for Seagull App Framework, comparing these with the New Installation
instructions from SeagullDocs, and at this point am getting a bit confused.
I would appreciate any pointers you might be able to offer.  I have not yet
installed Seagull in the [install-dir] because I am trying to determine what
that should be, but I have familiarized myself with the seagull directory
tree.

For background I am installing on SuSE Linux 9.0 using the XAMPP
distribution, so the PEAR library is already in place.  According to XAMPP
documentation, the Apache DocumentRoot directory is /opt/lampp/htdocs/.

My questions are the following:

~ What is [install-dir] in this context?

~ Where do I insert the seagull directory tree in the current filesystem
tree?

~ Are there any other installation steps that I should follow?

~ How does one demonstrate installation success?

Many thanks for any assistance.

Phil

Sajith,

A reasonably good MVC architecture, named Seagull, is here:

http://seagull.phpkitchen.com/

It is developed as a full blown CMS. I didn't want to submit entirely
to it's means of taking care of content, but I found the design and
flow to be very nce. After figuring out how it worked, I stripped it
down to the barebones, and began developing custom modules for it.

I'll back up Alex when it comes to the Flexy templating system. The
forementioned architecture uses them, and man, it couldn't make
separating Busines logic from presentation any easier. It's reasonably
quick to learn too.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] object getter/setter methods
Message-ID: <7bdec587050310193974b57ada@mail.gmail.com>

For every object that I create I end up making countless getter/setter
methods. My User class is littered with methods like getUsername(),
getEmail(), etc. This can add up to thousands of lines of code for my
objects. Is there a better way around this? A method like this would
cut down on code:

/**
 * Get the value of the given property.
 *  eg. $username = $user->get('username');
 * @param   string  $var    Name of the property
 * @return  mixed
 */
function get($var)
{
    return isset($this->{$var}) ? $this->{$var} : null;
}

However this would allow for access to any of the properties, which I
don't necessarily want. Has anyone tried using the above approach to
success/failure? I suppose another approach would be to make all of
the accessable properties in an associative array. I am aware of
php5's __get/__set magic methods but am currently still using v4. I
like the idea of having the specific getX()/setX() methods in my API
because it seems clearer for others to read. However I feel that I'm
writing a lot of unnecessary code.

I've run into this article titled: Why getter and setter methods are
evil. http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html

This is a java article that advocates eliminating accessors. I'm not
sure if I want to go to that extreme, but I guess there are a few good
points.

If I may be allowed to badly paraphrase Dan's point from a couple days
ago, OOP isn't about writing less code now; it's about writing less
code later.  And who's going to be writing the code later?  Often it's
other people.  Give them as many tools as you can to reduce their
code.

Yeah, a complex enough class is going to have tons of get and set
methods.  That's part of what makes it easy to use.

I seem to recall working with a Java IDE that had a wizard-lie thingy
where you could make a basic bean. It would create all the getters and
setters for you. You could envision a PHP tool that could look at a PHP
class, see its fields and generate accessor methods for you... I wonder if
it's been done (-:

Easy enough to make, no doubt.  But I ran into this a WHIIILE back (nice to

Eclipse / WebSphere AD does this, it's very handy... especially when it 
comes to refactoring things.  I wouldn't be surprised if there were some 
PHP plugins that offer similar behavior:
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=eclipse+php+plugins&btnG=Search


The Web Standards Tool subproject of the Eclipse Web Tools Platform looks 
promising too:

"The subproject will provide tools that directly support the base 
standards and that are also extensible. For example, the HTML editor will 
be extensible to support HTML-based template languages such as PHP and 
JSP. While a JSP editor is in the scope of the JST subproject, exemplar 
tools for popular Open Source languages such as PHP are in scope."

I too am curious the consensus of this question.  I have thought of
implementing something similar to the following, but havent yet.

I know this can be simplified in php5, but this gives similar
functionality in php4...

Derek's question (balancing the value and trouble of creating accessor 
functions for each variable) did not *exactly* match the topic of the 
article he mentioned: deciding on the design-wisdom of accessor 
functions in general, assuming that they often have the effect of 
allowing other code to meddle in what is "really" the business of the 
class.

The article says:

Seems to me he has a point, and as a novice programmer I'm persuaded to 
try and avoid reading/manipulating class properties as much as possible 
and write the class do whatever the calling code might be doing with 
that property. Did anyone read the article and want to comment on it?

daCosta's approach is pretty much what I was considering. I already
have a small script to automate creating basic classes along with
their getter/setters. My issue lies more in determining if the methods
(extra code) is needed, or if there is a simpler way to do this. It
seems from previous responses that the consensus is to keep the
getter/setter methods.

I agree with this philosophy, and try to impart it to my (Java)
students.  To really *get* OOP, you have to retrain yourself to think
a certain way.  (This is slightly easier with my students, most of
whom have never programmed procedurally.)  An object should be
self-sufficient, and the user of the object should get the information
needed by doing nothing more than passing a couple of messages to it. 
You, the class designer, should have already done all the other work.

I disagree, BTW, with the notion that you can avoid coding the
accessors and mutators, because you never know when someone will want
to use one; however, I do agree that smart class design can avoid the
user's need to call them most of the time.

Like the article said, figure out first what people need to do with
your objects; the rest flows naturally.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] A tale of two tables...
Message-ID: <5942350551ec1979db009acbdfcd0dff@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

I'm about to build a little mini application and would appreciate a 
little feedback/advice.

The application allows for a user to log in and view a list of hosts 
and guests.  The data is stored in two MySQL tables (one for hosts and 
one for guests).

The user will be able to pick a host and match them to a guest.

My plan is to have a column called match_id in both the host and guest 
table.  When someone selects a host and guest, the app will insert a 
unique id into both the host and guest record.  My plan was to use a 
date/time stamp (including seconds) to create the unique match_id.

Another page view will display the list of matched hosts and guests, 
where I will query both tables and join them by the match_id.

So, here are my questions:

Is there a better way to create a unique id than the time/date stamp?
What would happen if two users are logged in at the same time and make 
a match at the exact same time?  Not sure how MySQL handles when 
requests are being made at the same time.  Would it barf?  Could it 
potentially create two identical date/time stamps for two different 
matched groups?  (That would be very bad, given how I have designed the 
system so far).

Thanks in advance for any info and/or pointers, or even just validation 
that I'm on the right track.  =)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Mbstring
Message-ID: <BE5769FC.23307%jfreeman@nybg.org>


Question:

We recently upgraded PHP on an internal server to 5.0.3 and we're seeing
some odd stuff with regards to strings.

PhpSupport doesn't really mention anything useful.

But phpMyAdmin throws this:

The mbstring PHP extension was not found and you seem to be using multibyte
charset. Without mbstring extension phpMyAdmin is unable to split strings
correctly and it may result in unexpected results.


Php.ini sez this:

[mbstring]
; language for internal character representation.
;mbstring.language = Japanese

; internal/script encoding.
; Some encoding cannot work as internal encoding.
; (e.g. SJIS, BIG5, ISO-2022-*)
;mbstring.internal_encoding = EUC-JP

; http input encoding.
;mbstring.http_input = auto

; http output encoding. mb_output_handler must be
; registered as output buffer to function
;mbstring.http_output = SJIS

; enable automatic encoding translation accoding to
; mbstring.internal_encoding setting. Input chars are
; converted to internal encoding by setting this to On.
; Note: Do _not_ use automatic encoding translation for
;       portable libs/applications.
;mbstring.encoding_translation = Off

; automatic encoding detection order.
; auto means
;mbstring.detect_order = auto

; substitute_character used when character cannot be converted
; one from another
;mbstring.substitute_character = none;

; overload(replace) single byte functions by mbstring functions.
; mail(), ereg(), etc are overloaded by mb_send_mail(), mb_ereg(),
; etc. Possible values are 0,1,2,4 or combination of them.
; For example, 7 for overload everything.
; 0: No overload
; 1: Overload mail() function
; 2: Overload str*() functions
; 4: Overload ereg*() functions
;mbstring.func_overload = 0

I know I'm moving in the right direction but I'm not sure what needs to be
uncommented (and then httpd needs to be cycled)...

Does anyone have prior experience they can share which will lead me to
uncomment the right thing and NOT uncomment the WRONG thing?

TIA,

J.

Ok,

The first question is what kind of relationship are you trying to model 
here?

Is it:
- one-one   - each host is matched to a single guest
- one-many  - each host may be matched to many guests
- many-one  - each guest may be matched to multiple hosts
- many-many - each host may be matched to many guests and each guest may 
be matched to many hosts

If it is 1-1, then you would only need a column in the host table to 
hold the id of the matched guest, with a unique index to prevent 
multiple hosts being matched to the same guest.  You could also do this 
in reverse (add a column to the guest table to hold the id of the 
matched host)

If it is 1-many or many-1 you do the same thing but without the unique index

If it is many-many you will need a third table to hold the matches. 
This table would have at least 2 fields to hold the host id and guest 
id.  You may want to add other fields such as the event or user (if I am 
on the right track in terms of your application)

<slaps forehead>

I do indeed have a unique index (in both tables).  I'm a bit of a SQL 
(joining) novice.  I will create the column in one of the tables to 
hold the unique id of the other.

That's really cool, simple and elegant, I love it.

Thanks Dan!

Message-ID: <0d850d9e0d7efb733b5401e754191899@cyber-ny.com>

Hi Guys,

How can I get all of the articles under a certain category?

I have a table with the following structure:

Categories
ID - int
CategoryName - varchar(128)
ParentID - int [Foreign Key to Categories->ID]

Articles
ID - int
Category_ID - int [Foreign Key to Categories->ID]
Article_Name - varchar(128)

Sample Category Tree
--------------------
Food[1]
--Natural[2]
----Fruits[3]
------Apples[4]
------Pears[5]
------Oranges[6]

Now the client wants to be able to click on "Natural" and if there are 
no articles listed directly under it get all the articles for "Fruits", 
"Apples", "Pears", "Oranges".

The only solution I have is to write a recursive function that will 
retrieve each CategoryID that has the ParentID of the argument passed. 
Once I have this array of CategoryIDs can then run a query on the 
Articles table.  As this tree grows it can amount to tons of MySQL 
Queries for each click that might be skipped anyway. Is there anyway to 
do this with one or two calls in MySQL?

I have argued against this but "the powers that be" told me it's a must 
have feature.

Thanks,
John

John,

Unfortunately there is no easy way that I know of to do this with the 
structure you are using, because it's not a 'true' hierarchy.

My favorite solution is a modified version of Joe Celko's Nested Sets.

Basically there is no elegant way to do it without changing your 
database structure.

John,

On a side note, if you are forced to build the recursive system it can 
actually be more efficient to retrieve the entire hierarchy tree with 
one SQL call and build it up in memory that to execute a query for each 
category.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Q: How can I get all of the articles under a cer

Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F9033011FF24A@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

How about getting counts of articles for the parent and then you can walk
the counts checking to see if articles exist?

step 1
		get parent id of category needed (select from categories)

step 2 
		get counts for all categories under parent id ( join
articles to categories ) 

step 3
		if you have article(s) under the category id fetch them
		else show tree of categories within parent that do have
counts

This method should allow you to walk up and down the parent/category tree. I
know you mentioned walng down from the parent to category, but what if they
said "apples" and you have no article, what will you offer instead?

If you're using MySQL 4.1 you can use subqueries, which will reduce the number of distinct queries you're hitting the database with.  There are essentially two forms:

derived tables

SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM othertable)

and regular:

SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM othertable)

There are also many variations:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/subqueries.html

At the end of the day, however, with the structure you have in place, you'll be somewhat limited.  NSM (nested set model) is the way to go if possible.  Here's an implementation of it that I did, although it needs to be updated:

http://pcomd.net/pcom.php?pcomname=pnsm

and could be optimized for MySQL 4.1.

hi folks..

I have some questions, maybe someone can offer some good suggestions.

-i have a client who is a photolab, he want to offer his clients the ability 
to upload their images to him. My solution was building a website, using php 
to let his clients upload the files. Files can be anywhere from 1 meg to 15 
megs - EACH.

I found a inexpensive phpupload script with great functionality.
http://www.scriptscenter.com/ezupload/

There are a few issues -- 
- since the files are large -- php.ini by default lets you upload 2meg files
- uploading such huge files could timeout while uploading..

question: is there a way around these 2 issues?

next - the client also asked about automating the files to download to his 
internal computers.. Is there anything out there that could do such a thing?

Has anyone worked on anything like this before.. any ideas- 
sugestions-comments?

thanks in advance.
regards
yury

Yep. You'll need some control over the apache and PHP config.  I've
gotten similar things working with very large files successfully.  This
looks like a good guide:

You could automate this by running the command line version of Unison
(file synchronizer) in a script periodically with the Windows Task
Scheduler or a cron job.  See:

I don't know the coders personally, but you might look at smugmug.com 
for an example. They provide a choice of just about all the ways to do 
it.... I grew up with them as a photo site and it was kind of painful as 
they figure out ways to do it over the past few years:

java applet if your browser can handle it, one-at-a-time html uploads, 
multiple-selects via JS for html upload, FTP via browser, progress bar 
via refresh (PHP or other), ActiveX component, etc.

Now it's easy and files can be huge. The latest work is a full API which 
resulted in users building cool tools like a Windows Explorer drag 'n 
drop tool and web services for uploading/downloading entire galleries. 
One person even built a scraper as a means of backing up his library, 
thumbnails and all  (that project might have prompted the opening of the 
API :-)

Given you do have access to these settings you can simply change the time,
size, and such... also, I believe the upload size limit can be set from
the script itself, so you can change it there if you don't want to
globally increases the upload size.  As for the upload script, if you
really want to stick with just php, you can always utilize javascript to
create more "file" form fields (similar to gmail's attachment upload if
you have seen it) as necessary in real time. Then you can use that
information to set your upload limit dynamically.

First time I hear about unison, but Andrew's suggestion is definitely the
way to go, either set up a cron job or windows task should do the job, and
you can write the script to do this in any language.

I want to thanks everyone for their comments!  The client and my boss 
decided to drop this feature.  Notch one for the developer.

I want to learn more about Nested Set Models so I have been googling 
around on this. This project would take a lot of work to convert (270 
category entries, 57 on the root). It was the fact that 3000 articles 
would be displayed on the click of Root that made the client change 
their minds. Their board members are still on AOL Dial Up.

Thanks,
John

Yury,

You can have the user compress the files and upload. List the directory 
of the compress file, get the user's comments on the order, insert a 
order file into the compressed file, place a copy on a backup directory 
and a copy on the sync directory. Use RSYNC over SSH to get the files 
onto the client's PC.  Using Cron and SSH Keys would be secure and 
automated.

Thanks,
John

Upload_max_filesize is per directory...

Here is some information from the php manual which may 
be helpful: 

upload_max_filesize (PHP_INI_PERDIR -- default 2M)

post_max_size (PHP_INI_PERDIR -- default 8M)
"To upload large files, this value [post_max_size] must be 
larger than upload_max_filesize." 

memory_limit (PHP_INI_ALL -- default 8M)
"If memory limit is enabled by your configure script, memory_limit 
also affects file uploading. Generally speaking, memory_limit should 
be larger than post_max_size"

And as yuri originally mentioned, max_input_time (PHP_INI_ALL -- 
default 60 seconds) could come into play as a limiting factor.

(Hmmn, file uploading -- could be a good topic for a phundamental)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP on Win.: Get Drive Letter for Current Script
Message-ID: <42692.69.86.84.233.1110641685.spork@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to get PHP to co-operate when it comes to creating a CD- /
flash-drive-based catalog.

When a user pops in a CD or USB drive, the running PHP script should be
able to detect which drive letter it's on. Depending on how the eventual
application evolves, if the user chooses to install the catalog viewer on
another drive (say c:\ or d:\), the resulting PHP script(s) that are
copied to those drives need to know which drive they reside on (so some
configuration files with drive information in them can be written).

I was thinking of using the WinRar self extracting module to extract and
copy the files from CD (or from a download) onto the chosen drive. WinRar
can run a .bat or .exe file post-installation. In this case, it would be a
.bat file that runs a PHP script which writes configuration files with
information such as 'absolute path to htdocs subdirectory on this drive'
and so on.

Perhaps I need to use a better installer such as Nullsoft's installer
which might write customized files for me. But I was thinking: it is nicer
to initial setup in PHP, especially since it is not rocket science - it is
just figuring out on which drive the script is running, and the absolute
paths to various subdirectories, and then writing to those subdirectory.
You can get the relative path to the currently running script from $_ENV,
but not the path with a drive letter. (The HTTP server for the catalog
needs an absolute path.)

The $_ENV environment variable contains various reference to the
'homedrive', for example $_ENV['homedrive']. But what if the user chooses
to install the catalog viewer to d:\, or e:\ ? This information is not
provided by $_ENV.

I did some research, and came across the W32api functions:
http://us4.php.net/manual/en/ref.w32api.php

This extension enables you to call functions available in Windows dlls (or
other dlls) using PHP.

I also found a good article on the subject at PHP Architect (
https://www.phparch.com/issue.php?mid=5 ).

This article lists the following code snippet to get and display
information using the GetSystemInfo function from kernel32.dll. I looked
at Microsoft's API documentation on this subject (
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/getsysteminfo.asp?frame=true
) but I could not find out how to use this function to determine the drive
letter on which the current script is running.

Does anyone know how to do this using the W32api extension or by any other
method?
One (convoluted) way to do this would be to let the script check for the
existence of a file on all drives, C - Z using is_file(). So it would
check for c:\myfile123.php, d:\myfile123.php, and so on. But this is not
the best way to do it. There has got to be a better way!

I'm not an expert on this, as PHP's native support for utf-8 has
always been enough for me.
But answers to the following might be helpful in troubleshooting:

Are you, in fact, using multibyte characters? What characterset?

Was your previous version of PHP compiled with mbstring enabled? Are
you using the same ini file?

GetCurrentDirectory( sizeof( DirPath ), DirPath );  
should give you the active drive and directory. 

I don't know if you can hook up to the call with 
 w32api_invoke_function (....) 

Seems like it might possibly work...

String in general, or really just the warning from phpMyAdmin?

It's likely you don't have the mbstring extension installed.  You can recompiled PHP with --enable-mbstring, or if you're on Windows you can uncomment the php_mbstring.dll line and restart.

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2984100

Or do what I do and ignore it - I'm not using multibyte characters, so phpMyAdmin is flapping in the wind.

Hi Tim,

thanks for your reply. You referred me to the current Windows API
function, but my sample (PHP) code did not work.

I think is because this extension only worked with a range of older
versions of PHP, judging from information on the individual function pages
for this extension (
http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.w32api-deftype.php ).

Here the sample code that I used with PHP 4.3.10

<?php
// Get current directory using Windows System DLL API

// Load the w32api extension
// Dynamic loading did not work for me (so I added an entry to php.ini)
 dl("php_w32api.dll");

// Register Windows API function
w32api_register_function("kernel32.dll", "GetCurrentDirectoryA", "string");

// Make a buffer of appropriate size to store the current directory path
$buf = str_repeat(' ', 255);

// Call the function so that it stores the value of the current directory
path in $buf
GetCurrentDirectoryA($buf, strlen($buf));

// Output it:
echo "Current directory is $buf .";

?>

This is resulted in a fatal error saying that GetCurrentDirectoryA is not
defined as a function. I.e., this extension is not working.

I tried the ffi ( http://pecl.php.net/package/ffi ) extension PHP 5, but
it gave the following error:
---------------------------
Warning
---------------------------
PHP Startup: ??8: Unable to initialize module
Module compiled with module API=20020429, debug=0, thread-safety=1
PHP    compiled with module API=20041030, debug=0, thread-safety=1
These options need to match

If anyone knows a way around please let me know (perhaps a C extension for
PHP 4? I can understand a bit of C when I read it, but writing it is
another thing).

Thanks,

- Jay Sheth

Jay,

You should be able to use the getcwd() function to tell you where the 
script is running.

Hi Dan,

thanks a million! The getcwd() function did the trick. I did not even know
it existed. I think it would be a really useful function. I cannot believe
I did not know of it until now.
Thanks also for the __FILE__ constant tip.
If you come to the monthly meeting / dinners, I owe you a drink.

Best regards,

- Jay

Hi Dan,

Looking at my test script again, there is an important difference between
getcwd() and __FILE__ that may be of interest of to others.

The sample script is:
<?php
echo getcwd();
echo "\n";
echo __FILE__;
?>

I invoked it with:
cd c:\php4cli
php-cli.exe c:\devel\php\getcwd.php

And it outputted:
C:\PHP4CLI
c:\devel\php\getcwd.php

So, perhaps getcwd() outputs where you currently are at the command line,
but __FILE__ outputs the full path (including drive letter) to the
currently running script.

Best regards,

- Jay

Indeed, you are correct.  In a web environment they are usually the 
same, but from the command line or if you use the chdir() function in 
your scripts, getcwd could very easily be different.

I wish I could get down to some of the meetings to take up your offer!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Images from Raw Binary
Message-ID: <8d9a428005031406587ce86fa0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have done this before so i know it works, however i also know i am
missing a step, maybe a replace or maybe even a foreach loop to do a
replace or something.

I am using a 3rd party solution to show some data on a clients site,
this is an MSSQL database, i have gotten it to connect fine FINALLY,
however now i run into a problem with the images.

Each record has an image column which i am told contains RAW Binary.

i have tried this code

$img = imagecreatefromstring($row['medium_photo']);
header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');
imagejpeg($img); 

however that results in this error

The image "http://66.111.250.100/test.php" cannot be displayed,
because it contains errors.

you can see the binary data by going to 
http://66.111.250.100/test.php

IIRC i needed to do some foreach loop on this binary data and perform
some operation on each element but i cannot remember what was needed
honestly.  This is where i call the help of you guys :D

I assume this doesn't extend to the Standard edition?

I'm just a high school student so I can't really afford to fork out
$200 for a php editor, even though I use the Zend Trial and I think
it's one of the best editor's out there.

See this is where I get confused:

Student Pricing:
Description 	Price 	 
Zend Studio - Professional Edition 	$99 	Contact Us
Zend Studio - Standard Edition 	$99 	Contact Us

They're both $100, but I doubt I could use the Zend nyphp discount to
get it for free (technically they'd owe ME a dollar :D)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Maguma Open Studio
Message-ID: <57284.69.86.84.233.1110856464.spork@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I thought some of you may be interested in the newly released Maguma Open
Studio. It is an open source version of Maguma's older Maguma Studio
product.

I had bought this product a couple of years ago, and it was pretty good
(although limited in some respects) at the time. At the time I really
liked the fact that Maguma bundled PHP, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin and Apache
(along with controls to start and stop Apache) into one package. But now I
use XAMPP for the LAMP stack and jEdit for an editor.

>From a cursory look, this new, open source version seems to have new
icons, and probably other new enhancements too. It also has a built in
debugger. It seems to be a bit rough around the edges, but since the
source has been posted at Sourceforge, such deficiencies / bugs are
perhaps best seen as invitation to fix them.

An open source PHP IDE for Windows and Linux is a welcome addition to the
PHP community. The Sourceforge description says "Delphi / Kylix" leading
me to believe that it could also be compiled for Linux using Kylix -
although I have not used either Delphi or Kylix, and don't know if code
from one can be imported into another. Binaries are only available for
Windows, but it's still worth checking out.

For more information, please see:
http://www.maguma.com/index.php?article=os_main&id=126
and
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openstudio

Best regards,

- Jay Sheth

Hi all,

I just thought this information would be useful to others. The WinBinder
extension provides some very useful system information through its
wb_get_system_info() function:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Changing UNIX shadow passwords with PHP
Message-ID: <200503151830.j2FIU8j06616@host.brandunknown.com>

Hey Everyone.

 

I've been trying to figure out a simple yet secure way to allow user's with
mailboxes on any of our servers to change their passwords via the web.  I
have done extensive research on the web and haven't found anything promising
regarding doing this in PHP.  It seems I may be able to accomplish it with a
Perl script and then I could wrap that Perl script around a PHP interface
but I'm not even sure that would work.  The passwords are stored in a shadow
passwd file format so however I accomplish this I would have to change to
root to make changes to the /etc/shadow file.  Would I have to use SUID to
accomplish this?  Does anyone know of any PHP scripts that could help me
accomplish my goal?  I'm sure someone somewhere has the need for a script
like this.  Naturally all of this would take place over a secure connection.

 

So does anyone have any advice on how I can accomplish this in PHP?

Look into sudo. You can sudo the "/usr/bin/passwd" file so that it can 
be run as the user of your apache (probably "nobody" or "apache" or 
"http"), then do a
system("/usr/bin/passwd $user $password");
in php. This method would make a sysadmin a bit nervous though.

Another safer way to go about it would be to append all password 
requests to a designated file, in the format "username:password" then 
create a root owned cron script which runs "/usr/sbin/chpasswd 
<thefile>" every minute or so. You would want to employ some method of 
file locking within the cron script and also the php script because if 
the job runs while the php script is writing to the file, odd things can 
happen.

Please pretend that this is the *only* way to carry this out. Giving
the webserver access to sudo is just asking for BIG trouble down the
line. The very idea makes me shudder (sorry, Rolan).

Your cron script should probably respect a list of "never change"
accounts, including root and whatever account you use for shell
access.

Well this is all very helpful.  I agree that the safer way to do this would
be through the cron job.  I'm looking into various ways to do that and have
yet to find an efficient file locking mechanism that will work for both Perl
and PHP.

 

But a bigger problem I'm having is that because my server is using Virtual
Hosts I haven't figured out how to use the usermod function to change
passwords.  Basically if a user has a username of "foo" on the "bar.com"
domain, usermod would require the username parameter to be "foo at bar.com".
But that doesn't work because the /etc/shadow that is in the virtual
directory for the bar.com domain just has "foo" as the username.

 

I guess the smartest way around this would be to manually process the
/etc/shadow file instead of using usermod.

Hi all:

I am currently looking for a search engine to be used for our next website
redesign... and wonder if there's anything good that does a good job with
the following:

1. able to index different types of file, incl but not limited to: pdf,
html, php, doc.

2. able to index a database driven site, i.e. site with its content stored
in a database.

3. handle large number of documents (500K?) or no limit.  can merge index
files during search / after indexing if necessary.

4. definitely not as expensive as the google search server, which cost
somewhere like 25K... we'd probably at most be able to spend 5K on the
solution.

5. config files or a web/gui interface for indexing (but not confusing, i
consider swish-e not terrible), can be easily integrated into a custom php
search result page.

I've looked at swish-e and DTSearch so far, but I am sure you guys have
better idea than I do.  If you have some good suggestions please let me
know.  Thanks in advance!

Although it?s not PHP, Atomz has most of the features you?re looking for.
I?ve used it a couple of times and have been very happy with it (as happy as
one can be with a search engine, that is). It's a hosted (ASP-style)
service. Point it at your site, tell it how often to index, and then design
the results page. Pretty simple. There's plenty of administrative control
via a web interface, and it'll send a monthly report what it's been up to.

How about creating/looking for /tmp/shadow.lock ?

Does passwd(1) work? As long as the root user that runs the command is
jailed in the same virtual host, it will update the correct
/etc/shadow.

mv.  Have the cron job move the file before using it.  Have the PHP/PERL
scripts create the file over again if it doesn't exist.

By the way, you better make damn sure you carefully screen the input and 
disallow any harmful characters.

I concur that Atomz had a very nice search product, but expensive. I was 
quoted $20k for the Atomz service for less pages than requested here. I 
used that version of Atomz for two years and it was very good.

Atomz was recently acquired by Website Story, and is being integrated 
into their analytics software suite. It will not be a stand-alone search 
product any longer. From the webside story site:
"*Atomz* name will be sunset upon closing of the transaction and the 
organization will operate as the WebSideStory Search and Content 
Solutions Business Unit." and  "Some of the products are already 
partially integrated, such as HBX Analytics and *Atomz* Site Search. 
Deeper integration should occur within one year. The engineering 
organizations are working on an integrated roadmap that we will announce 
in the coming months."

As you can see from swish-e and DTSearch the problem is indexing quickly 
and managing the index. In my experience there is no good product right now.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Q: Authenticating XML Data Exchange
Message-ID: <763b5f4e0ad66f5d1ac82b063137be65@cyber-ny.com>

Hey Guys,

I have a project where membership database information will be passed 
to a fulfillment center as the members sign into the system. The 
center's server will send back info on the status of the transaction 
once the member goes through the checkout process.  We will be using 
PHP/MySQL on the client's site and the fulfillment center will be using 
ASP/MSSQL.

How can I make sure that the data I get back is from the fulfillment 
center's server? Can SOAP be used over SSL?  I am reading a few 
tutorials on SOAP and I can get Google and Amazon's Web Services 
working but what about security?

Thanks,
John

Thanks for the input everybody.

 

I'll go ahead with using a cron job, a shadow lock file, a chroot jail, and
the passwd function.

 

Now it's just a matter of getting it to work flawlessly.

Sure, SOAP can be used over SSL encrypted HTTP.  SOAP messages are just
that, messages, and can and have been delivered by nearly any method,
including http(s), smtp, jabber, and if you're truly desparate, even
smoke signals.  The point is that SOAP is not tied to the transport
mechanism.  Your SOAP library or framework will be the limiting factor
in what means it is able to exchange mesages.

HTH,
Andrew

We need to see a demo of the smoke signals at the next NYPHP meeting --
then again maybe the building management would not approve.

Hi there.

This is an old problem that I am again searching for the prefect solution to.

How do people here handle stripping crap like curly quotes out of 
text that users are pasting from Microsoft Word?

Any pointers or advice are welcome...:)

preg_replace would be the best i think... then u can just use a regexp like

[^a-zA-Z0-9\-\s\.\,]* to replace all the non-alpha numerical (excluding a
few exceptions like punctuations) with anything u want...

note: the regexp is just an example... so there might be typos and
stuff... read the doc on regexp to create one that will suit your needs

Subject: [nycphp-talk] QuickForm / PHP (Zend Engine) Bug - callback function
	never called
Message-ID: <4238EE6D.7070900@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have come across commonly occuring QuickForm bug that might be due to 
either a QuickForm bug or a Zend Engine bug (unless I am doing something 
really stupid here.)

Okay, here's the gist of it:

If a QuickForm object is instantiated inside of a conditional check, the 
callback processing function will not be run, UNLESS the callback 
function is defined BEFORE the if "( $form->validate() )" check.

(The following examples are based on sample code from David Sklar's 
"Essential PHP Tools" book.)
For example, in the following case, the callback function will NOT be run:
---------------------------
<?php
/*
praise_book() function is defined AFTER  'if ($form->validate())'
The callback function will now NOT be run
This is a PHP or QF bug
*/

define ("IS_TRUE", true);

if (IS_TRUE)

                            [1] => -7
                            [2] => 1

                )

            [SNIP ... more stuff in here. Please run the example to see the entire output.]
)

-------------------------
Now, in the following case, if praise_book is defined before 'if 
($form->validate())', it will work as expected. Also, if the conditional 
check "if (IS_TRUE)" is removed, it will work as expected.

What is going on here?
Is it something that I am missing, or is it a PHP or QuickForm bug?

Thanks in advance.

- Jay

The topic of IDE and general programming environments/techniques for PHP are a common one.  A face-off style meeting would be good if someone would be willing to moderate/organize it.

Jay,

As far as I know function definitions within conditional blocks are 
executed inline with the other code, thus the behaviour you describe 
would be correct as the function would not yet have been defined.

I could be way off though...

	never called
Message-ID: <4239C29E.4070106@ceruleansky.com>

Hello Dan,

Thanks for your reply. I have boiled down this experience to two test 
cases. In the first case, there is no conditional check, and so the 
call_user_func() succeeds. In the second case, the call to 
call_user_func() fails, simply due to the conditional check. I feel 
there is no logical reason for the inclusion of a conditional check to 
cause call_user_func to fail. Does anyone on this list know if someone 
has deliberately designed PHP this way, and if so, why?

Thanks in advance,

- Jay Sheth

Example 1: call_user_func() succeeds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?php
    if ( is_callable('echo_echo') )
    {
        echo "<p> echo_echo() is a callable function. </p>";
        call_user_func('echo_echo');
    }
   
    else
    {
        echo "<p> Error: echo_echo() is NOT a callable function. </p>";
    }
   
    function echo_echo()
    {
        echo "<p>This has been outputted by the echo_echo function.</p>";
    }
?>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2: call_user_func() FAILS, due to conditional check
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?php
define ("IS_TRUE", true);

if ( IS_TRUE )
{
    if ( is_callable('echo_echo') )
    {
        echo "<p> echo_echo() is a callable function. </p>";
        call_user_func('echo_echo');
    }
   
    else
    {
        echo "<p> Error: echo_echo() is NOT a callable function. </p>";
    }
   
    function echo_echo()
    {
        echo "<p>This has been outputted by the echo_echo function.</p>";
    }
}

else
{
    echo "<p>Unfortunately, it's not true.</p>";
}
?>

Yes.  A function has to be declared before you can use it.  Functions 
declared normally (outside conditional statements) are declared when the 
file is parsed.  Functions declared in conditional statements are declared 
during run time _when_ _execution_ _gets_ _to_ _them_.  So, you can solve 
your issue by reordering your script to put the function declaration above 
the is_callable() call.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Another QuickForm Bug  (Hidden Element Processing)
Message-ID: <4239D03E.6040604@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have found what I think is another bug in QuickForm (QF). Here is a 
summary of it:
if a non-QF form posts a hidden value to a QF form, the QF form object  
is unable to overwrite the hidden element's value.

1) An example can be found here:
http://www.moztips.com/qf_bugs/qf_hidden_bug.php?need_login_form=yes

View the source,  and examine the hidden input fields.

Type some text, and submit the form. Scroll down to see the print_r() 
values of the output.

Submitted Form Values:

Array
(
    [my_title] => bogus text
    [hidden_value1] => This is a bogus value that should be overwritten.
    [need_login_form] => no
    [save] => Submit this form to the QF script
)

2) Then visit:
http://www.moztips.com/qf_bugs/qf_hidden_bug.php?need_login_form=no

View the source again, and submit it.

You will see that the value of the 'hidden_value2' is reset to 'This is 
a hidden value' in the second case, but not in the first.

Submitted Form Values:

 
Array
(
    [hidden_value1] => This is a hidden value.
    [hidden_value2] => This is a hidden value.
    [need_login_form] => no
    [my_title] => bogus text
    [save] => Submit this QF form for processing
)



The full source of this example follows my message. Again, am I doing 
something really stupid, am I overlooking something, or is this a bug?

Thanks in advance,

- Jay Sheth

Hi Dan,

Thanks for your reply.

I was not actively aware of this difference before. I tried a similar 
example in JavaScript, and it behaved the way you described it.
I guess this is pretty standard practice (in programming languages, that 
is), and I was not aware of the differences  between the parse order of 
functions declared inside of and outside of conditional blocks.

Normally this situation is less common, since I usually declare 
functions before I use them (include files that contain related 
functions at the top of the page), unless it's QuickForm, in which case 
I tend to do it this way.

Best Regards,

- Jay

*About Code.google.com* 	

*What is code.google.com?*
    Code.google.com is our site for external developers interested in
    Google-related development. It?s where we?ll publish free source
    code and lists of our API services.

*Who are the people behind code.google.com?*
    A lot of people worked together to both prepare source code for
    release and prepare code.google.com for launch and ongoing
    maintenance. We really care about free and open source software
    (F/OSS) at Google, and this site is one aspect of that affection.

*Google's Projects* 	

*Which projects are being released?*
    We've chosen 4 projects to start out. Perftools, sparsehashtable,
    coredumper and goopy/functional. Details can be found at
    http://code.google.com/projects.html
    <http://code.google.com/projects.html>

*Why did you choose these particular projects?*
    Well, several reasons, actually.

    ? Google Engineers picked them.
        You may have heard about 20% time, in which Google engineers are
        encouraged to work on a personal project one day out of the
        week. Open Source interests a lot of Google developers, so we
        thought taking advantage of this program was a good way to
        prepare code for release and maintenance.
    ? They make future releases possible.
        The programs we've chosen are all what we consider
        infrastructural programs. By releasing these tools, we will be
        able to release more software that relies on them later.
    ? These are the ones that were ready first.


*Are these programs still in active use at Google?*
    They aren't just in active use; they're in active development. These
    first projects are all current, actively maintained code straight
    out of our repositories, and as we improve them, those improvements
    will be merged into the free code base.

Message-ID: <8d9a4280050317120947b499ea@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have been working with the Exceptions in PHP 5 and i cannot figure
out why i am getting these results nor can i figure out how to trace
the resutls.  Let me start with the code files


This is my main exception class.

<?php
/**
* The MysqlEx class
*
* This is the exception class for the main Application class
*
* @author Joseph Crawford Jr. <codebowl at gmail.com>
* @copyright Codebowl Solutions 2005
* @package SimonVolkov
* @subpackage Exceptions
*
**/
class SvEx extends Exception {
	
	const ERR_TYPE = "Unknown Error";
	const ERR_DESC = "There has been an error. This error has been
logged. Please try again in a few minutes.";
	
	
	protected $_msg;
	protected $_tpl;
	protected $_error;
	
	
	public function __construct( $error = null ) {
		
		$this->_error = array(
			'type' => self::ERR_TYPE,
			'description' => self::ERR_DESC
		);
		
		$this->_tpl = Application::Template();
		$this->_tpl->assign( 'error_type', $this->_error['type'] );
		$this->_tpl->assign( 'error_description', $this->_error['description'] );
		$this->_msg = $error;
	
		parent::__construct($this->_msg);
	}
	
	public function Display() {
		$this->_tpl->assign('admin', 1);
		$this->_tpl->assign('msg', $this->_msg);
		$this->_tpl->display('error.tpl');
	}
}
?>

from this i extend for each exception type that i have

here is the application exception

<?php
/**
* The MysqlEx class
*
* This is the exception class for the main Application class
*
* @author Joseph Crawford Jr. <codebowl at gmail.com>
* @copyright Codebowl Solutions 2005
* @package SimonVolkov
* @subpackage Exceptions
*
**/
class ApplicationEx extends SvEx {
	
	const ERR_TYPE = "Application Error";
	
	public function __construct( $msg = null ) {
		
		parent::__construct($msg);
		
		$this->_error['type'] = self::ERR_TYPE;
		
	}
}
?>

when i throw a new ApplicationEx for some reason the
$this->_error['type'] is not getting set to Application Error but yet
Unknown Error.

you can see an application error thrown on this page for testing

http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/clients/JVMedia/SimonVolkov/global.php

the Error Reported part is going to be hidden from the end user and
only shown to admins and locally during development.

here is the line that is throwing the ApplicationEx Exception

if( ( isset( $dbinfo['type'] ) && $dbinfo['type'] != "" ) && ( isset(
$dbinfo['host'] ) && $dbinfo['host'] != "" ) && ( isset(
$dbinfo['database'] ) && $dbinfo['database'] != "" ) ) {
     self::$_db = new $dbinfo['type']($dbinfo['host'],
$dbinfo['database'], $dbinfo['user'], $dbinfo['pass']);
} else {
     throw new ApplicationEx("Could not instanciate the database
object, you must specify the database type, hostname and database
name.");
}

and here is the code to catch the exceptions

try {
	
	$app = new Application( $dbinfo );
	
} catch(MysqlEx $mysqlEx) {
	
	// show the error message
	$mysqlEx->Display();
	
} catch( ApplicationEx $appEx ) {

	// show the error message
	$appEx->Display();
	
} catch(Exception $e) {
	
	// show the error message
	$e->getMessage();
	
}

any help with this would be appreciated.  I have tried to debug using
zend studio however using the __autoload magic function zend studio
says fatal error class SvEx cannot be found.

Hello Joseph,

I think I know what is going wrong regarding the exception handling 
issue you mentioned.
In the SvEx class, you declared ERR_TYPE as a constant (or static member):

const ERR_TYPE = "Unknown Error";

ApplicationEx extends SvEx, and even if you redeclare ERR_TYPE in ApplicationEx, it still retains its old, immutable value from SvES, which is "Unknown Error."
If you change ERR_TYPE to be a protected member (thus inheritable by subclasses), it should work.

For example:

<?php
class SvEx extends Exception {
	
	protected $err_type = "Unknown Error";
	const ERR_DESC = "There has been an error. This error has been
logged. Please try again in a few minutes.";
	
	
	protected $_msg;
	protected $_tpl;
	protected $_error;
	
	
	public function __construct( $error = null ) {
		
		$this->_error = array(
			'type' => $this->err_type,
			'description' => self::ERR_DESC
		);
		/*
		$this->_tpl = Application::Template();
		$this->_tpl->assign( 'error_type', $this->_error['type'] );
		$this->_tpl->assign( 'error_description', $this->_error['description'] );
		*/
		$this->_msg = $error;
	
		parent::__construct($this->_msg);
	}
	
	public function Display() {
		$this->_tpl->assign('admin', 1);
		$this->_tpl->assign('msg', $this->_msg);
		$this->_tpl->display('error.tpl');
	}
}
?>

and then:

<?php
class ApplicationEx extends SvEx {
	
	protected $err_type = "Application Error";
	
	public function __construct( $msg = null ) {
		
		parent::__construct($msg);
		
		$this->_error['type'] = $this->err_type;
		
	}
}
?>
---------------------------------------------
and then a test:
---------------------------------------------
<?php
// exceptions2.php

require 'SvEx.php';
require 'ApplicationEx.php';

try 
{
   $error = 'This error goes to the ApplicationEx exception handler';
   throw new ApplicationEx($error);
} 

catch (ApplicationEx $e) 
{
   echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
   echo "<pre>";
   print_r($e);
   echo "</pre>";
}

// Continue execution
echo 'Hello World';
?>
---------------------------------
It should output the following:
---------------------------------
Caught exception: This error goes to the ApplicationEx exception handler
ApplicationEx Object
(
    [err_type:protected] => Application Error
    [_msg:protected] => This error goes to the ApplicationEx exception handler
    [_tpl:protected] => 
    [_error:protected] => Array
        (
            [type] => Application Error
            [description] => There has been an error. This error has been
logged. Please try again in a few minutes.
        )

    [message:protected] => This error goes to the ApplicationEx exception handler
    [string:private] => 
    [code:protected] => 0
    [file:protected] => C:\apachefriends\xampp\htdocs\nyphp\exceptions2.php
    [line:protected] => 10
    [trace:private] => Array
        (
        )

)

Hello World
-------------------------------------------

Hope that helps,

I just found out that our ISP made some changes to the php.ini and got rid
of CURL.  It just so happened to coincide with my using CURL in a class.
Figures it is something that had nothing to do with the code and I'm pulling
my hair out looking at it.

Hi,

I would like to know if anyone has experience with Gentoo and how it
stacks up against other linux distributions, especially Fedora.

Also, does anyone have any experience with skunkweb
(http://www.skunkweb.org) and/or python and postgres, and care to share
their experiences with them?  What kind of learning curve is needed for
python, for instance?


Regards,

Peter

It all depends on how much interaction and control you are looking
for. As a learning experience, you'll get a lot more out of a Gentoo
install, but if you just want something working reliably & right away,
with a minimum of fuss, Fedora is the way to go.

Last semester I finished a CS course which used Python as the 
programming language of instruction (it always used to be C).  My 
impression of Python is that it is fairly similar to PHP in a number of 
ways:

Don't have to declare variables and types before using.
Can program procedural or object-oriented style.

My experience is that it was a pretty approachable language, certainly 
not as strict as Java.

If you want something working reliably and right away, I'd argue that
ubuntu (or Kubuntu) is the way to go.

I've never seen an easier install.

Love gentoo..
Was openbsd user prior and when I switched to linux looked for something
that would be similar.. gentoo fit the bill nice..

Most distro's install a bunch of garbage that some 13 year old on crack
compiled (take mandrake on a P4 for example).. Gentoo is a bit more work
to set up, but well worth it for optimizations and if you are like me
and fully lazy about patching..
Meaning, you can cron up the "emerge" tool to update your software
nightly so you are always up to date without having to think to about it
and you just need to run the built in tools for checking changes to
config files (which emerge nicely also does not clobber) and with a
world make.conf for always compiling stuff with mysql support etc et al
it is a dream for a sysadmin.
Pretty much the only distro I will use, think about using, and recommend
to programmers. For linux newbs, Mandrake or Redhat are fine to wet your
feet..

-cheers

i am not sure why however the values for the error_type and

Cool. I have a live CD ubuntu disk that I can try on windows and an
install disk. I will try them out. I think that Ubuntu is based on debian
like Gentoo.

thanks for the tip.

Message-ID: <4b188711050318142473261fdd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I need some eyes on this code.. I've been staring at it for too long..
and I dont know where to go for more debugging info.  I am using
Oracle and I get this error:

DELETE FROM ? WHERE DOC_ID=? [nativecode=ORA-00903: invalid table name]

I've checked the table names and tried just one at a time. Am I doing
something syntactically wrong? Where can I get more debuggin
information?

I know it's probably something really simple that I'm overlooking.

Thanks in advance.. sorry if this isn't appropriate.

------------------

$this->dbh->autoCommit(false);
  	
  	$sth = $this->dbh->prepare('DELETE FROM ? WHERE DOC_ID=?');
  	
  	if (PEAR::isError($sth)) {
  		trigger_error('Error preparing statements for document
delete:'.$sth->getUserInfo(), E_USER_ERROR);
  	}
  	
  	// Set array of tables where records will be removed
  	$data = array(array('APPROVAL_STATUS', $doc_id),
  				  array('AUTHORS', $doc_id),
  				  array('CORE_MATERIALS_FILENUM', $doc_id),
  				  array('DISCLOSURE', $doc_id),

  				  array('SIGNATURES', $doc_id));
  				 
  	$res = $this->dbh->executeMultiple($sth, $data);
  	if (PEAR::isError($res)) {
  		$rollback = $this->dbh->rollback();
  		if (PEAR::isError($rollback)) {
  			trigger_error('Error while attempting to rollback document

Try to use the ! for the field name.  This binding wildcard won't add
the quoting and will pass straight through.


   DELETE FROM ! WHERE DOC_ID=?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] recursive simplexml
Message-ID: <1f348d9e290565b79d33c2c76f10cf81@jobsforge.com>


I want to recursively iterate over an OPML file. It can have any number 
of 'outline' elements and each can have any number of children 
'outline' elements.
As I move down the tree I'll handle each by looking at their 'type' 
attribute.

here is an example snip of an OPML file:

		<outline text="Top">
			<outline text="About">
				<outline text="Website" type="link" url="http://www.yahoo.com"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="News">
				<outline text="Today's" type='headline'>

and where my mind was headed...

   $file = file_get_contents("thefile.opml");
   $xml = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new SimpleXMLIterator($file), 
true);
   foreach($xml as $element) {
   	if ($element == 'outline') {
     		if ($element[type] == 'link') {
                           SimonSays 'do this';
    	 	}
		if ($element[type] == 'headline'{
			SimonSays 'do that';
		}	
    	 }
   }

How far off am I?

ok so i figured out where my problem was, it was in the constructor
for the SvEx class, i had the template assigns there, i moved them to
the Dispolay method and it works as expected :)

one question though.

If an exceptions is thrown by PHP such as a fatal error or what not, i
cannot use my Display method.  Is there an easy way to rethrow an
exception as a certain type?  I would like to rethrow all exceptions
as SvEx type so that i can use my display method to get it to show a
nicely formatted error to go wtih the site's design, here is what i
have so far

End Users View (custom display)
http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/clients/JVMedia/SimonVolkov/global.php

Developers View (custom display) ( using localhost for the domain )
http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/clients/JVMedia/SimonVolkov/global.php?local=1

Default Exception Display
http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/clients/JVMedia/SimonVolkov/global.php?default=1

i would like to be able to use my Display method with all exceptions /
error that PHP is throwing.  Any ideas would be great.

To catch all exceptions without wrapping code inside try/catch blocks, do this:

function my_exception_handler($e) {
    throw new SvEx($e->getMessage(), $e->getCode());
}

set_exception_handler('my_exception_handler');

Although, it may be better to aggregate the original Exception inside
your custom one, as I believe the debugging information will be
disrupted. (Such as the line number and stack trace.)

However, the good practice fairy says it's better to really wrap stuff
inside try/catch, so you know exactly what you're doing and when
you're doing it. (I guess you could always just make a master
try/catch around the main control flow.)

Adam,

i tried a master try/catch but it didnt grab parse errors since they
are not thrown as exceptions in php 5.

i was trying to implement my own custom error handler and throw
exceptions based on that but i couldnt get the error handler to
trigger on parse or fatal errors either.

You cannot catch fatal errors. That's what makes them fatal. :)

Actually, those types of errors leaves PHP in an "unstable" state, so
it just bails out and doesn't give you a chance to execute additional
code.

Sorry.

No. How could PHP catch them when it can't figure out what your script
is? There'd be no way to specify what should be run.

Ubuntu is Debian-based, and Gentoo is completely different (based on
ports, more like a linux-*bsd hybrid).

Ubuntu is coming out with a major upgrade that is really easy to use,
and if you want a commercial desktop (for cranky laptop hardware, for
example) Xandros is a great debian-based distro.

I'm putting Xandros on my laptop when I get the chance, and also found
that GNOME's LiveCD of GNOME 2.10 works great - it is apparently
ubuntu-based IIRC.

Message-ID: <47301.69.86.84.233.1111338105.spork@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I spent a few frustrating hours yesterday on Zend's site and forum trying
to determine whether their encoder will work with CLI (command line)
versions of PHP.

I ask this because I am interested in creating offline programs with
WinBinder or PHP-GTK. These extensions require PHP scripts to be run from
the command line.

I even posted something to the Zend forum, but it never seems to have made
it there.

So it just seems to ask this question here.
(By the way, I checked David Sklar's Essential PHP Tools book, which
mentions several free encoders, and none of them support CLI or CGI
versions of PHP.)

Best regards,

- Jay

I'm not 100% sure about CLI, but it looks like Turck MMcache might do 
the job.

Message-ID: <423E24B9.2010801@ceruleansky.com>

Hi Rolan and others,

thanks for the tip. I always have wanted to try MMCache. I went to their 
site, but did not see any info on CLI usage.

Here is write-up on the state of PHP encoders and obfuscators - of what 
worked and did not work for me. This might be useful to others, and 
might save others the hours of experimentation that I had to go through.

Now for the Zend product, I downloaded the trial version of Zend Encoder 
and also Zend Optimizer(ZO). (ZO should really be called Zend Decoder.) 
While setting it up (the decoder a.k.a "Optimizer", I think), I chose 
'other' as the 'web server' to option. It then asked me where my php.ini 
file was, and I pointed it in the right direction. It then parsed the 
php.ini file and made the following entries in it:

zend_extension_ts="C:\Program Files\Zend\lib\ZendExtensionManager.dll"
zend_extension_manager.optimizer_ts="C:\Program 
Files\Zend\lib\Optimizer-2.5.7"
zend_optimizer.optimization_level=15

The Zend Encoder GUI is pretty basic, but seems to work. The sample 
WinBinder application that I encoded worked flawlessly.

I checked out the IonCube encoder, but it did not seem to work. Firstly, 
it seems to only support a webserver API, not PHP CLI, although I may be 
wrong on this. I tried IonCube with PHP 5.0.2 (as part of XAMMP), but it 
did not like it. I think the fine print in their site seemed to suggest 
that their decoder dll only works with PHP 5.0.3 and above. Weird. (I 
kept thinking: it should be this difficult to find whether these 
products support CLI or just mod_php for Apache, which php.ini entries 
need to be made, what their decoders are called, which decoder dlls are 
used, where to copy them etc.)

I also tried two PHP obfuscators, one free, and one shareware / commercial.

POBS is the free one:
http://pobs.mywalhalla.net/

It looks like a nice enough product, but like the commercial one, it 
produced a non-functional WinBinder application. In both cases, the 
WinBinder application launched, but the controls were useless (clicking 
a button did nothing.)

The commercial product is GridinSoft PHP Processor (Price: $50) (they 
seem to be based in Ukraine):
http://www.gridinsoft.com/

Their product is an obfuscator, and comes with a handy-dandy file 
preview and 'project' management tool, but it produced the same 
perplexing 'buttons-don't-work-this-application-is-non-functional' 
effect for the WinBinder script.

I also looked into Alan Knowles BCompiler, but it does not seem to have 
a tool to automatically decode encoded scripts on the fly:
Main Info
Manual: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/pecl.bcompiler.php
Download DLL: http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_STABLE/

I also tried Roadsend's Compiler + IDE tool (available for $89 for the 
basic edition):
http://www.roadsend.com

Unlke other encoders, they have completely rewritten the PHP parser and 
interpreter. Their parses parses PHP code, and compiles it into a form 
that their interpreter can read and execute. Whatever it 'interprets' is 
obviously not plaintext, and is probably some intermediate bytecode (I 
think).

It is pretty amazing that a small company such as Roadsend has rewritten 
the entire PHP processor tool. Their latest version also includes a 
PHP-GTK interpreter. But here's thing: they do not support all PHP 
extensions, because, as far as I know, they cannot load all extensions' 
dlls like the PHP interpreter does. I am not sure how they recreate PHP 
GTK apps, and if they actually use the Windows GTK libraries for this. 
(They must, I think.) So non-standard extensions such as WinBinder won't 
work with Roadsend.

RoadEnd's product can compile PHP GTK programs into standalone exes that 
can be run from CD, etc.

But here's the thing: I think that for my uses, WinBinder would be 
better, even in its alpha state. Its developer seems to be really active 
and I can see it moving out of alpha status pretty fast.

Well, I hope this write-up has been useful to others who are evaluation 
PHP encoder options.

As the last word (or sentence, it seems), I think I have two options: 
buy the Zend Encoder Small Business edition (Zend Encoder, Studio and 
Accelerator for $500 instead of $3717, 
http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-smallbiz.php ) or just make the 
project open source, which I think might be a good option too. If people 
want to steal the source, let them, but put a license on it so they know 
the dos and don'ts.

Best regards,

Hi,

Just a few notes:

Roadsend Compiler isn't an encoder as such, and it doesn't store an 
intermediate bytecode to be later interpreted. It is a true native 
compiler, so the output is machine code that is executed directly by the 
operating system (as if it were compiled C code, for example - the 
result is an .EXE file). No interpreter is required. Because of the 
compilation process,  it is not possible to retrieve the original PHP 
source code from the binary. PHP (both GTK and command line) 
applications can be compiled on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows (although the 
IDE is currently Windows only).

Our PHP-GTK extension does indeed use the actual GTK libraries. The 
latest IDE has a Deployment feature that makes it very easy to compile 
and distribute applications. Our upcoming release will include Glade 
support as well as many optimizations, IDE improvements, and an 
integrated step debugger.

Hello Shannon,

thanks very much for the correction on Roadsend. I got the way it works
wrong - sorry about that.

It is a great, unique product that fills a gap in what is currently
available. Congrats on having shipped initial versions of it.  I look
forward to future versions of the Roadsend compiler.

Thanks for clarifying the part on PHP-GTK. Support for WinBinder would be
great too !

Best regards,

ahh.. i've found the problem..  it seems that the tablename cannot be

not seem obvious the first five times I read the documentation. :-)

The process of preparing a query involves checking identifiers for 
validity and then remembering the query framework in a native format for 
later execution.  This speeds up execution of frequently used queries 
because they don't need to go through the identifier checks and compiling 
each time.  Thus, you can't substitute a table or column name this way.

You'll need to make a regular query in which you compose the query string 
using a PHP variable.

Thank you very much Dan. I knew you'd pipe up to correct me sometime.
:-) That's exactly what I am doing now. I am still using prepare() and
execute() with PHP variables, even though there is only one query per
table because I sense that doing that is still more portable than
issuing query() directly?

Oh, and another question: can I issue autoCommit(false)... then
commit() after all my execute()s are complete? Or does that only work
with query()?

The only similarity is that FreeBSD and Gentoo both build from source - 
apart from that they are different beasts. Gentoo (IMHO) has a better 
package system than ports.

If you are a power user concerned about long-term maintenance, I would 
argue that Gentoo is a better way to go.

Power user, yes. But if you are just worried about long-term

Prepare/execute doesn't improve portability.  Plus, I have a feeling you 
are wasting resources.  Prepare/execute is only efficient when you do one 
prepare of the query and then will be executing that the same exact query 
(without changing table/column names) multiple times.

I just had an interesting conversation with my boss, who hasn't coded

one has written a tool for PHP that will generate classes and methods 
based on the tables in the database.

So what he's saying is that I should be able to open an application, 
select a database, click an button, and presto! The result would be 
classes with methods for adding, updating and viewing records for every 
table in my database.

I don't know of any such thing. Dreamweaver can do this to some extent, 
but as procedural scripting.

Perhaps someone here knows of a tool that can do this?

An additional benefit is when dealing with larger data fields, such as BLOB and TEXT.  Column data in prepared statements don't need to be escaped, which can improve performance significantly.  Also, for very large data sets, you can enable chunk sending of the data, which can also improve performance and network issues.

I know of a tool written in Java that can sort of do that... It takes any
structured data and builds a database, a GUI and a search engine for all of
the data...

But the woman who built it is trying to make a commercial product out of
it...  It's not FOSS.

That is exactly what my boss was talking about. He said something like 
there were three tools that he used for more than 10 years. One of them 
generated code, one the GUI and one did reports.

I think Hendry has an application that he wrote to do this.  He has just

That's because he is used to the older data-driven design methodology. 
PHP (especially v5) and other OO languages allow us to use domain-driven
design.  

Instead of starting from the database structure and working outward to
try to solve the process, start with the business problem, build your
workflows/objects and finish with the data storage.  I find there is
much less iteration with this method.

Anyway, take a look at Umbrello.  The idea is to model you app using UML
and hit the "generate PHP" button.

I had thought that using prepare() and execute() increased portability
due to this line in the documentation:

"Another place prepare/execute is useful is supporting databases which
have different SQL syntaxes."

>> Plus, I have a feeling you are wasting resources.

I felt this way too, but I thought that portability was more
important. I know I could just escape the vars, hard code the SQL and
execute the query.

I did end up testing the commit() and it worked just fine. I know I
didn't even have to ask, I did just end up testing it. Though, at
first I wasn't exactly sure how I was going to approach it, being as
it was my first time using a transaction. :-)

Thanks for all your help.

Yeah.  But that portability can be obtained using the quoteSmart() method 
directly.  Though, in most cases, you can just put in integers as unquoted 
and strings as quoted with single quotes and you don't have to worry about 
portability.  The trick comes in two places: strings that need escaping 
due to "'" or "\" in them and booleans.

Message-ID: <29da5d1505032217246197fd35@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I've been using PHP for about ~1 year now. and I feel I should be
learning to use OOP to it's full capability in PHP.  I've been playing
with it a little bit, but the only real way I know how to use it for
my purposes is to double query the database, once to get the ID, then
do a while loop and create an instance of the class from that ID
given.  From there I would go and query the information within the
class, and have method's to return certain pieces of information so
that I wouldn't have the code on the actual page.  I'm aware that
pretty much anything you want to do on a webpage can be done without
OOP, and strictly on the page, but I find myself writing a lot of the
same code that has the exact same purpose on another page.  I'd like
to be able to keep my code organized, as well as be able to create a
website for someone and have someone else maintain it with ease.  My
Brother was attempting to explain to me how to do OOP without double
querying the database, but it was over the phone and it was a bit more
complicated that way than with some text in front of me.  What I'm
looking for are some tips on how to use it properly, or some
recommended books / websites that explain this.  Thanks in advance.

I just finished putting the first version of a simple (near trivial) 
utility page.

All the page does is to allow to do the following functions on a string:
Length
MD5
CRC32
Upper
Lower
Proper

I decided to do the site after I found myself needing lenght for various 
reasons while developing. Also put  the other functions as I ocassionaly 
need them too.

The URL is http://stringsutils.com

Feedback is welcome.. in particular what functions others may find 
usefull.

While trying to not go too offtopic PHP...
  I don't think this is an "old approach". It has to do with how someone 
sees the problem and his/her background.. For example to ask a database 
designer to think of the problem as processes and not of data is like 
asking a fish to feel confortable outside of water. :-)

I personally think there is more risk on the top down approach. In 
particular users, over time, tend to internalize the process. They don't 
see certain parts of the process anymore because they just "do it" when 
the screen/process comes up. If you just ask abou the processes one needs 
to be carefull to make sure those internalized steps are not skipped.

On the other hand I find users tend to know the data they work with fairly 
well.

Moreover, when doing a re-engineering project asking about processes tends 
to get you feedback of how things are.. but the whole purpose of the 
re-engineering is to re-do that.. Doing a bottom up approach allows the 
user to tell you what it is that needs to be captured.. as long as their 
current process.. and let's the designer come up with new ways to do the 
process.

I really think that either approach will work.. it's just how a person 
sees processes/design and how experienced they are.

Are you interestedin OOP or in code re-use?
Two different concepts.. just happens many people confuse them.
You can have code re-use without OO and have OO with little re-usability.

I don't know others, but I would follow your sample much better if I had 
code to look at.

That's code re-use. You can achive it without using OO.

Which can be done without OO.

My advice is that you look for basic sites that explain Object Oriented 
programming and once you better understand the concept see if you think 
you like it and if it will be helpfull to you.

If you post the class you wrote myself and others would be able to give 
you feedback on your class.

I will try and give you my 2 cents version of what OO is.
It's a way to see operations based on items (or objects as used in the OO 
lingo).

Whereas before you would have functions like
format(string)
compute(number)

OO tells you to think of "objects" and how different operations can be 
performed on them.

Example you could have a class "figure" to refer to a geometrical figure.
You could think of what type of interaction you would need with such as 
figure such as finding it's area or volume.
In the non OO world you would have something like
area(figure)
volume(figure)

But how do you know the figure has a volume?
In OO you have
figure.area()
figure.volume()

The class itself can handle returning the proper value if there is a 
volume or perhaps 0 if the area is only 2 dimensions.

I am certain there are very decent explanations/tutorials out there in the 
net on OO. Once you understand the concept it is not very difficult to 
apply it to PHP.

My advice for you at this point would be to read both PHP Anthology
books from Harry Fuecks, published by SitePoint. Harry has some smart
approaches to some of the things you want to address, and manages to
communicate them in a very readable format. He will also explain a lot
behind OO (especially with regards to PHP's OO underpinnings), but is
not silly about OO for everthing as a perfect panacea.

Overall very very good books.

Also reading PHP 5 Power Programming by Gutmans, Bakken and Rethans,
which of course comes from some highly respected members of the PHP
community. Seems to also be a very good book for getting beyond the
'Learning PHP' book realm.

I can second Mitch's opinion on PHP 5 Power Programming.  It is a good 
introduction to PHP 5 and OOP.  It is not an OOP book.  It is a book 
about programming with PHP 5 including information on subjects from 
working with files to using PEAR and PECL packages.  The book includes 
information about classes and syntax in PHP5 and brief discussion about 
different OOP design patterns.  I found myself wanting more information 
about OOP and PHP5 after reading it.  But I always want more 
information.  It is one of the books I have read almost cover to cover.

I agree with that. I think there is risk in either approach, you have to 
use what best fits the situation.

In my experience, tools that generate code tend to create more overhead 
than necessary. I think that I am better off writing Dreamweaver 
extensions that I could use to create the basics of what I would need 
for a class and its methods.

Is this true even when the back end is MySQL 4.1.x and the underlying PHP
API is mysqli? I thought I read an article on zend.com that extolled the
benefits of prepare/execute and suggested it was always a win, but maybe I
was smoking crack again and misunderstood.

Follow-up question: is it a wash if you are only doing the query once, or
is it actually less efficient w/ prepare/execute than without? Let's
assume you are not working with TEXT or BLOBs

Agree. However the one time I find such tools usefull is when you have a 
very large project ahead and the users have little idea of what they 
want/need. Making dummy mockups so users could have an idea of how the 
program may look can be very helpfull. Specially when trying to satisfy a 
large number of users.

Sorry for the vagueness.

Here is an example class I might write in order to retrieve
information for my news page:

class News

var $id;
var $rs;

  function News($id)
  {
     $this->id = $id;
     $query = "SELECT * FROM news WHERE id = $this->id;";
     $result = mysql_query($query);
     $rs = mysql_fetch_array($rs);
     $this->rs = $rs;
  }

  function getTitle()
  {
     return $this->rs['title'];
  }

  function getCategory()
  {
    return $this->rs['category'];
  }


etc with more methods almost identical to that
}

Also, it's not that I necessarily want to write OOP for everything,
but I don't like being lost when reading code with OOP in it.  I
understand some of it, but a lot of times certain things go right over
my head.

i am not quite sure what you are attempting to accomplish here but you
can simplify

     $rs = mysql_fetch_array($rs);
    $this->rs = $rs;

with just $this->rs = mysql_fetch_array()

When you don't prepare the SQL statement ahead of time, the database
has to do the preparation itself before it executes the query. If you
only make the query a single time, there will be some additional
overhead with an explicit preparation, as there's additional
communication back and forth between the db and the client.

However, I would say that, at least in the case of MySQLi and MySQL
4.1, that this can be worth it, as it allows bound parameters. The big
win here is that you don't need to call mysqli_real_escape_slashes()
on strings. This can reduce your chance of opening up yourself to a
SQL injection attack. So, it's a security win, even if it's a minor
speed loss.

Hello all,

I just came across this product today (via a Google Adwords Ad). It 
generates a user interface that can update a given database. I have not 
tried it, and the price looks a bit steep. But maybe it is worth 
checking out:
http://xlinesoft.com/phprunner/screenshots.htm

A note of caution: their name is spelled wrong on their "About Us" page, 
so that is something of a warning sign. Anyway, this is the first 
product of its type that I have found, and someone asked for it, so I 
thought I would mention it here.

Best regards,

- Jay

A class, in my opinion, is meant to be something you use for several 
programs.

The example you wrote is basically a one program/scenario class. I think 
on a case like that it's probably counterproductive.

On the other hand if you wrote class that would take as a parameter a 
connect string to the database and be able to insert/read data from ANY 
table, that would be worth spending the time making a class out of it.

That's assuming I have the news only in one spot.

I could have a news page and then a box with headlines etc somewhere
else that is displayed elsewhere (I don't, but I could).

More specifically, I was going to have a Comments and User class, with
different methods within each which could be used on multiple pages.

Is it correct that you have to do something like this:

mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "ssssssss",
    $student['lastname'],
    $student['firstname'],
    $student['middle_initial'],
    $student['address1'],
    $student['city'],
    $student['state'],
    $student['postal_code'],
    $student['email']
    );

and you cannot pass an array as the last argument, like this:

mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "ssssssss",array_values($student));

...or am I missing something? Some other shortcut, perhaps?

This seems kind of painful, but then again maybe I'm a spoiled brat --
a PEAR/DB-spoiled brat, to be exact.

Not that I know of. It's tricky, as the function binds by reference,
not value. I looked at adding a patch, but was too busy.

Excuses!!

Maybe a future version... meanwhile I'll shut up and deal with it.

Thanks Adam.

BTW kudos for the discussion in "Upgrading to PHP 5". It is particularly
helpful where the official docs are lacking, and in at least one instance,
inaccurate.

Since flattery will get me everywhere, another question:  What's the
benefit of binding output parameters? My guess would be speed.

Good question.

I haven't benchmarked it, but I don't think speed would really be the
big win here. I would say code clarity could be a win, but some might
say that an explicit assignment is actually more clear. I guess it
depends upon your preference for magic.

Message-ID: <29257-77528@sneakemail.com>

As a follow-up to the SEO presentation last Tuesday, someone asked how 
Yahoo! handles 302 redirects since there does not seem to be any 
"hijacking" problem on Yahoo!

During the talk I did not recall that Yahoo! presented their new 
approach to handling the 302 redirect in Las Vegas last November. I was 
in that audience and it was very important at the time, because Yahoo! 
had been mis-handling 301's as well as 302's for several months prior to 
that and it had become a real hassle. I don't know why I forgot about it 
--  Anyway I looked it up and it is archived on the Yahoo! blog here : 
http://www.ysearchblog.com/files/wmw2004/search-engines-and-webmasters.ppt

See slides 14 and 15 for a description of how they handle the 301 and 
302 redirects.

Basically if the 302 is within-site, they either keep the original 
anyway (if it was root) OR (if it was deep within site) keep the new 
target page.
If the 302 is OFF-SITE, they choose to store the target in the index, 
which eliminates any benefit to 302 redirecting as a form of hijacking.

This seems like a pretty straightforward answer to the problem. 

Why would you want to index the results of a "temporary" move to
another host in the first place? There must be some reason they built
it that way...

So at the last meeting, some of you poisoned my mind by suggesting
that PHP: Quebec would be a good time. :-) So now I am considering
planning a trip up there. It's only a 7 hour drive from where I am in
Connecticut. This would be my first trip to Canada. I've been just
about everywhere else, but Canada is still uncharted territory for me.

Think it's too late to register or scam my way in as a student? ;-)
Anyone else going as a speaker or not?

Looks like you might still be able to get the student rate at the door
as long as you have student id.

I went last year, and enjoyed myself. Just be sure to get out of the
hotel for a bit and walk around the city -- drinking at bars doesn't
count!

I believe Chris and Chris (Hendry and Shiflett) will be there.

I've never been, but Adam spoke well of last year's event, and I'm 
planning on having fun, if that counts for anything. :-)

I'm glad I missed most of this thread...but yes, I'll be there and
last year was a great time.  So far it's my favorite PHP conference.

Though I'm still convinced that there is something wrong with the beer
up there, because as hard as Hans Z and I tried, we could barely catch
a buzz.

Will be trying again this year tho if anyone wants to join me.

Molson XXX.  When I lived in Vermont ('95 - '97), this beer was
domestic only (I've heard that they started exporting it since). 
Something like 8.5% ABV, where most beers are 4 or 5%.  Enjoy!

What is going to Montreal, has two Hans', two Chris', three airplane seats, 8 laptops and doesn't speak any French?

The NYPHP convoy to PHP Quebec of course!

Kaspersetz, Shiflett and Hendry are giving presentations, and I believe are flying up.  I'll likely be going (although not 100% yet) and if I do will likely take the train up (8 hours, but it's not bad and has power outlets).

Jeff, if you're planning on heading up, let me know if you'd rather take the train, or even if not, let's touch base.

I plan to. At the very least, I'll blog after the conference and link to 
all of the coverage I know about.

I'll also take lots of pictures, so maybe I can catch the NYPHP 
"Canadian beer can't get us drunk" gang after a dozen of that XXX stuff 
someone mentioned. :-)

Haha... I used to live only 40 minutes south of the border with Canada so I know all about that beer - and it's very good.  But, what's very strange, is that we couldn't find any in Montreal!  Even the Heineken was strange tasting!  Maybe it's just that clear northern air....

Correct - that's typical prepared statement syntax.  It's really not too bad once you get used to it - it's also trivial to write a wrapper function.

Speed, yeah - especially when dealing with large sets of data - and memory consumption.  It's important to keep in mind the basic data flow between client (PHP) and the MySQL server.  There's storage on both endpoints, and with large data sets, memory can become a real premium.  The prepared statement syntax allows finer control over how/when to transfer data from the server, to the client, and finally into a PHP variable.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] openssl not being picked up by configure
Message-ID: <007501c5330b$2128b560$d0893818@oberon1>


I recently rebuilt Apache 2.0.53 with:
...
"--enable-ssl" \
"--with-ssl=/usr/local" \
...
and php 5.0.3 with:
'--with-openssl=/usr/local' \ 

I was trying to use openssl 0.9.7f 
(also recently built)

when I enter:
/usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl version

I get:
OpenSSL 0.9.7f 22 Mar 2005 

but phpinfo() reports:

OpenSSL support  enabled  
OpenSSL Version  OpenSSL 0.9.7e 25 Oct 2004  

I tried running 'make clean' 'make distclean' 
and then executing ./config.nice before rebuilding 
but it seems like the new openssl is not 
being picked up. 

Can someone shed some light on this for me?

Thanks in advance.

Looks like /usr/local/ssl is your base directory for the version of OpenSSL you want.  Give --with-openssl=/usr/local/ssl a shot....

If that works (or even if it doesn't) see what ldconfig has to say about where your libs are.  If Linux:

ldconfig -p | grep -i ssl

or, on a BSD:

ldconfig -r | grep -i ssl

And unless you have other dependencies (for instance, the old version of OpenSSL was probably installed using an RPM or some package system), I always remove the other versions of libs I don't want.  Having multiple lib versions can become quite confusing.

Yeah, I often get lost about what runs with what... 

I thought it might be good to keep the other openssl as is. 
(figuring I can look into it later)

So I went with your suggestion to try "--with-openssl=/usr/local/ssl" 

Hey, whadda ya know -- phpinfo now reports the server running 

OpenSSL support  enabled  
OpenSSL Version  OpenSSL 0.9.7f 22 Mar 2005

No problem - happy it worked.

I'm a little scared that ldconfig reports the other, older lib.  Depending on the build tools you're using, and the version, platform, and more voodoo, what ldconfig reports can count more or less.

G... N... U... do that voodoo that you do

Funny you should call it voodoo -- 
making some of this stuff still seems rather mystical to me.

And having a 'config.guess' in my directory doesn't do much 
to instill a lot of confidence in my builds. A lot of the 
time, for me, its sort of like 'Wheel of Fortune' building 
( Vanna, is there a 'libxml' directory -- oh! oh! I think I 
can solve the puzzle now ) 

I at least feel a little better when the makefile has a 
'check' or 'test' target I can try...

Message-ID: <328AA5243F20DA4DABDC022745BF3A0713141D@INTAMAIL2k3.ny.inta.org>

This one seems unusual to me. I'm using PHP 4.3.2 with MySQL. 
I'm getting a bomb when I use flush() and mysql_fetch_object().

When I set my server to E_ALL & ~E_WARN & ~E_NOTICE, the operation
completes as expected. The operation is also successful if I use any
WHERE or LIMIT clauses in my SQL query or comment out flush().

However, when I leave E_WARN in the config or use flush(), I get no
output and I can't get the warning to appear in the browser or error
logs.

This sounds like mysql_fetch_object() is throwing some kind of warning?
Perhaps akin to "no more rows" or some such?

Hello everyone,

I have been looking for a PHP class to process PayPal payments using
PayPal's IPN API for some time now.

I just came across this, which seems to do just that:
http://www.geniegate.com/other/paypal/

I have not looked at its code in detail yet, or tried it out yet, but it
looks promising, and might be useful to others.

Best regards,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Server Path for HTML IMG SRC?
Message-ID: <ed4edc1743d110b042cc04fc59c7dfae@musgrave.org>

Hello List -

Is there a way, maybe an Apache directive in .htaccess, to instruct an 
HTML page to look for an image resource if multiple directories without 
using PHP?

I have an issue where there is a file that sits in /events/file.php and 
it includes images that sit in /events/images/.  File.php is also 
included in /otherevents/ and the paths to image assets are relative in 
file.php, causing the images to 404 because they are looking for the 
images in an images directory that doesn't have that particular asset.

Is there a way to instruct Apache to serve up images from another 
directory should it not be found at the path that is defined as the img 
src?

Thanks,

Stephen

You could use symbolic links on the file system.

Or make file.php smarter.  Use a variable for the path in the img src's 
and have the variable determined according to where the calling file is.

I thought I'd ping the list about this before I dive into this idea.
Has anyone ever tried to set the PHP module as a handler for images?

I have something like this in mind:
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .gif
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .jpg
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .png

Did you have actual binaries behind the requests or scripts?  Google
turned up some of the latter, though nothing terribly interesting.  I'm
interested in the former - binaries.  Were you successful?  Any hiccups

Yeah, I'm probably crazy.

While not exactly what you're talking about, I have used PHP scripts to 
dynamically generate images via gd on the fly.  Pretty easy.

Depends.  What's the goal?

I've never done this with php, but we used to do it all the time in
Vignette. You can use this technique to do some cookie get/set for
custom images.

I see no reason why it wouldn't work with php, although I don't
understand your question about binaries.

Also, you can put the AddType in the .htaccess, obviously.

Or just whip out some regexp-fu with mod_rewrite.

Yep, that's fun stuff.

I'm thinking something along the lines of setting the PHP module as a
handler for image files + a prepend script w/ output bufffering +
sessions + auth (both) + good ol' caching.  The goal is to have a
relatively non-invasive way to control access to and modify existing
images in the docroot on-the-fly w/ PHP.

Like others I ask, why?

If you mean, just putting image binaries in place and running them
through the PHP handler, it could work but will the right Content-Type
header be sent? No, prolly not.

You could use an auto_prepend to handle headers. If you have an
accelerator in place it shouldn't be *that* much slower than Apache,
although I would worry about memory usage on BIG images.

I did some of that in Vignette StoryServer waaay back, too.  IIRC they
went so far as to call them "chips".

Well, basically I want to insert PHP before and after an image is served
with a prepend / postpend script.  I had output buffering in my mind
because I figured the script flow at some point would be turned to the
image itself and this is where I think some possible quirkiness may
arise.  I imagined something like this:

- prepend script runs
	- sets up session
	- checks auth
	- output might be sent and script execution stopped for some
	  reason
	- starts output buffering
- requested "script" runs (the image!)
- postpend script runs
	- grabs output buffer
	- modifies, replaces, etc the image
	- caches the result given context
	- sends image to the browser

I can see not actually having to do the output buffering by having the
execution always stop in the prepend.  If the image itself is to be used
in the output, you can grab it from REUQUEST_URI and read it off the
filesystem. Something like: 

- prepend script runs
	- sets up session
	- checks auth
	- generate output, might modify, replace, etc the image
	- caches the result given context
	- sends image to the browser
	- exit()
- requested "script" never runs (the image!)

This is probably the more sane approach to this.

The end-game is to insert some functionality in place of images without
moving them/replacing them in the docroot.

Yeah, thats what I had in mind.  See my last post.

Hmph, good point.  Hadn't thought about the accelerators.  Might be able
to turn off the caching for some scripts?  I'm pretty sure Zend's can.

Actually, if the execution ends in the prepend like I described in a
previous post, does the binary ever get hit by the accelerator?  Is this
accelerator-specific?

My only point was that the prepend would be opcode. If there aren't
any <?php tags in the image, then there's nothing to compile there,
right?

If you use just the prepend you'll spend some time second-guessing
Apache's request -> filename resolution won't you? Maybe not that much
time, never mind.

Does anyone know if the accelerators are smart enough to 'pass through'
flat content like this and not stuff a bloated binary or even a good ol'
text/plain file in memory?

Possibly.  Quite likely if theres some rewrite stuff in there.  However,
I believe one of the magic $_SERVER values would have the post request
-> filename resolution to-be-run script path in it?  Unsure which off
the top of my head.

Yeah, I was waiting to see if that got suggested, or a more generic handler.

Actually I think Apache could handle it with a Files container, perhaps inside a directory if needed to protect the rest of the site.  <Files flename> SetHandler GoodFile </Files> and that can go into htaccess as well.

Working out the details is a-trivial for me because my brain starting hurting on this specific example:

? are all images in /events/images or are some in /otherevent/images
? why name a script file.php... and why copy it to multiple locations.... <Files File>SetHandler File </Files> it is soo confusing :-D       Go ahead and try it and accidentally set yourself into a recursive loop.... like I did. Bleh.

This is an example of how a site designed around the filesystem can start to get in its own way, although this specific example is especially "difficult"

I may not be answering what exactly you are looking for, but on the 1 hand
you want to use non PHP method to solve your problem, while on other hand
you describe your problem as part of "file.php". I suggest that if you
already have control over your "file.php" then why do u want to use non PHP
method to server images dynamically? Why not to use "file.php" it self for
searching images at multiple locations?

Thanks

Hi Guys,

How can I export a file from Excel which has 1000's of names that uses 
German, French, Spanish accented characters to MySQL 3.23.58?  I know 
that MySQL 4 has unicode but upgrading this database is not possible 
right now.

Thanks,
John Nunez

I think the easiest way is to save the excel sheet as csv.
Then you can create a quick script that explodes the data.
Run the data through htmlentities and output a SQL statement for each line.
I could probably organize a sample script if you need it.

Good Luck.

Hey Garrett,

Thanks,  I can write the script but will htmlentities handle all types

John,

It should if you make sure your table collation is using the correct
character set.

I think it will, depending on the charset. But if one of the accents is 
not handle properly, you could use  preg_replace, changing it to 
something that you can convert back later when you output.
have fun,

Alternately, you could try urlencode() on your data before insertion. It
may not work perfectly, but I think it's worth a shot.

Are you asking if you can make SoapServer bind to an included class?
If so, yes. It doesn't matter if the class is included or embedded in
the file.

If I'm misunderstanding, please try again. :)

Depending on the WSDL, yes. I would try it and see.

There's a big section in this article about security. I think the
assessment included is misleading in a number of ways (for one - not
discussing the total number of apps, just the number of exploits), but
it does have an important conclusion - which is still true - it's
still pretty easy to write code that falls prey to common security
holes, regardless of what platform you're on. Be careful out there.

Good work, Dan. Did you have doubts you could do it?

(I seem to recall you did a wee bit of optimization at the end of January?)


I hope you'll share a little stats down the road, like the relative difference between #1 and where you were before (I think it was 2 or 3?)

For those interested the start of a Google index update was reported 
late March 23 (last Wednesday night) and is still propagating. A page 
rank update is expected this weekend as well.

Many people seem to think the impact of "no follow" will show in this 
update. One analysis showed 5% of the sites in DMOZ had nofollows on 
them, suggesting "no follow" it would have a very large impact on rankings.

There are also many reports of changes to the way back links are valued. 
I would wait another week before assuming anything was stable.

Can anyone here tell me why i am getting these results.

	public function Query( $sql = "" ) {
		$this->_result = mysql_query( $sql, $this->_link );
		
		if( $this->_result == false ) throw new MySqlEx( 'MySQL Error:

		return $this->_result;
	}

if i pass that a query trying to query a table that does not exist
then the exception is actually thrown but without an error so it
seems.  If i do or die on the mysql query function it dies with the
error message but isnt passing it to my exception constructor.

I can't seem to get my destructor to run and I wonder if somebody can help
me see what I am doing wrong. The goal is simply to have a single instance
of this db connection object and have its close() method called
automatically before the script exits.

class MyDatabase extends mysqli  {

	private static $db = false;

	private function __construct() {

		printf("constructing %s...<br />",__CLASS__);
		parent::__construct("host", "user", "password",
"database");
	}

	public static function getInstance() {

		if (self::$db === false) {
			self::$db = new MyDatabase();
		}
		return self::$db;
	}

	function __destruct() { echo "closing...";  self::$db->close();}

}

$db = MyDatabase::getInstance();
print $db->host_info;
---

OUTPUT
constructing MyDatabase...
localhost via TCP/IP

... and you expect to see "closing..." after the localhost line, right?

Have you tried unset($db); to after print $db->host_info;?

I have indeed (as of just now). Same story.

OK, here is the ugliest workaround you've seen all day. A pint of beer for
anyone who can explain why I am having to do this. I added to my
constructor:

register_shutdown_function(array($this, '__destruct'));

and it works, so to speak.

Testing your code on my server, I have a few observations. 

1) it worked for me BUT I don't have mysqli compiled into this server,
so I wrote a dummy mysqli class

2) PHP complained that the __construct() function was private -- why
is it private?

So I'm guessing that mysqli steps on your destruct() function, and/or
the private construct() is weird-making.

I am stealing liberally from G. Schlossnagle's "Advanced PHP Programming."
The private constructor is to prevent everyone except my class from
instantiating it, and thus make sure the singleton is truly single.

Let's see what happens when I make the constructor public... nope, same
story.

I have also tried having a mysqli as a static member variable rather than
extending mysqli, and various variations -- in some of which, the
destructor worked too well, i.e., it destroyed the object before all my
code was done using it, because the singleton thing is working.

OK, let's try it with a non-mysqli parent... hmmm. I don't get any
complaints about private constructor in my mysqli subclass, but I do
in this example:

class MySingleton extends ParentClass {

	private static $db = false;
	private function __construct() {
		printf("constructing %s...<br />",__CLASS__);
		parent::__construct();
	}

	public static function getInstance() {

		if (self::$db === false) {
			self::$db = new MySingleton();

		}
		return self::$db;
	}

	function __destruct() {
		// ParentClass has a close() method
		self::$db->close();
	}
}
$instance = MySingleton::getInstance();

...with an nice informative error message. You can't override a method and
give it more restrictive access than the parent method (as w/ Java). I
make the constructor public and it runs fine, destructor and all.

I wonder why I get away with a private constructor in my mysqli subclass.

I would think that your static $db inside the MyDatabase class is why 
your not having your destructor called prior to the script ending.

When you do:

$outsideDB = MyDatabase::getInstance();

$outsideDB should be a reference to the private static $db inside 
MyDatabase.  So you can unset that in the script, but it only removes 
the reference to the hidden $db.  And being that internal $db still 
references the object you created __destruct() won't be called.

It will be called when the script terminates, but I believe the output 
buffers are closed by this point--so echo in the __destruct() won't be seen.

You could try another method that unsets the $db inside the class to 
prove or disprove my theory.

I don't really follow, but maybe that's because I'm a little dense.

I thought of that and tried writing a string to a file. That worked
whenever echo worked and it failed whenever echo failed.

I added this to the class:

	static function unsetConnection() { self::$db=NULL; }

because PHP didn't much care for unset(self::$db). Then from outside the
class I did:

	MyDatabase::unsetConnection();

at the end of the script, and the destructor did not execute. Can't say
whether that proves or disproves anything since I'm not quite sure I'm on
the right page.

Thanks,

	David
