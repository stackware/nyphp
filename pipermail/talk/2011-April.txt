Hi all, I was wondering how much the going rate for a website redesign is going for now days. I am always turned down in my town for charging too much, but I really can't see doing a site for less. 

http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2009/07/18m-being-spent-to-redesign-recoverygov-web-site.html

I think I am under charging. Sorry to bring this up but it is really eating away at me, as I know I would have loved to been in on this bidding, if in deed it did go up for bid.

Hi Bruce,

I think it largely depends where you are. For example, if you're in
NYC, you can easily command a *much* higher rate than I can here in
Oklahoma. In NYC, the going rate is $90+ an hour I hear while I work
comfortably here for $25.50 to $30 an hour. So depending on where you
are, you might not be undercharging at all.

Check your competition and see what they charge. Set your prices
according to your local market.

That is incorrect.  Perhaps a few programmers at Wall Street firms are 
getting $90 an hour, but the going rate for normal folks here in NYC is 
about $50/hr.

Although for sure plenty of folks come onto the NYC list and try to 
undercut our rates...

Also "website redesign" is not usually programming but involves other 
skills (like CSS, graphics design, etc).  I would not be surprised to 
see rates differ between that and actual programming tasks.

Well, my point wasn't so much an exact price but rather that the rate
you charge largely has to do with where you're providing services. Since
I'm not sure where Bruce is (I am assuming NYC but I don't know) I
simply used a number I'd seen elsewhere. The number itself is
meaningless, really, but the idea was what I was trying to convey.

You're right though that 'website design' probably does differ a lot in
rate from programming but numbers weren't my point. :-)

Bruce,

Also, please bear in mind that 95% of the budget on these "big 
redesigns" goes to non-technical persons (management, artists, and 
various hangers-on).   For systems consulting, say, you know, where it's 
just for a few hours or a day or two, and someone restores data and/or 
deals with a hardware emergency, then yes, $90/hr or even $100/hr is 
common.   Major league Sys Admins and DBAs can also score that much.

But at $50/hr, that comes to $2,000+ a week or about $9000+ a month 
(depending on how many hours you can get per week).  For a humble 
programmer of PHP that is about as good as it gets, unfortunately.  I've 
been consulting in the NYC market for over 10 years, BTW, and also was 
on the sales end placing consultants for several years during the middle 
of the last decade, so I know what rates really are...

Stand your ground on a reasonable rate as long as you can; the forces at 
work to undercut us and reduce our income are relentless and brutal.  
Yes, you as a programmer do deserve to make a decent living, no matter 
what you are told by people looking to save a buck or two.  Good luck!!

Most programmers on this esteemed list, including those who are located 
in remote areas of the U.S., agree that working for substantially less 
than $50 sets a bad example and undercuts a living wage for the whole 
lot of us.  I know many programmers outside of NYC who also earn the 
standard $50 an hour and I think that, for anyone of any reasonable 
expertise and experience, between $45-50 is a very reasonable benchmark 
and for costing out "lump sum" projects, the $2,000 a week figure is useful.

Bear in mind that for every hour we bill out, we also incur the cost of 
expenses, business losses through unpaid invoices, unpaid time spent 
marketing, bookkeeping etc.  In reality, billing at $25 an hour would 
lead to a poverty income for any consultant, unless they were 
consistently able to bill 60+ hours each & every week of the year, which 
is not a reasonable or pleasant expectation.

Hmm...good points Kristina and it brought up a few things I'd not
considered. Perhaps I need to raise my rates a bit.

The hourly rate is meaningless because it depends on how much work a particular 
person can get done in an hour.

A proficient and efficient programmer who gets twice as much work done in an 
hour than someone charging $45/hr, can command $90/hr.

Well, my point wasn't so much an exact price but rather that the rate
you charge largely has to do with where you're providing services. Since
I'm not sure where Bruce is (I am assuming NYC but I don't know) I
simply used a number I'd seen elsewhere. The number itself is
meaningless, really, but the idea was what I was trying to convey.

You're right though that 'website design' probably does differ a lot in
rate from programming but numbers weren't my point. :-)

Bruce,

Also, please bear in mind that 95% of the budget on these "big 
redesigns" goes to non-technical persons (management, artists, and 
various hangers-on).   For systems consulting, say, you know, where it's 
just for a few hours or a day or two, and someone restores data and/or 
deals with a hardware emergency, then yes, $90/hr or even $100/hr is 
common.   Major league Sys Admins and DBAs can also score that much.

But at $50/hr, that comes to $2,000+ a week or about $9000+ a month 
(depending on how many hours you can get per week).  For a humble 
programmer of PHP that is about as good as it gets, unfortunately.  I've 
been consulting in the NYC market for over 10 years, BTW, and also was 
on the sales end placing consultants for several years during the middle 
of the last decade, so I know what rates really are...

Stand your ground on a reasonable rate as long as you can; the forces at 
work to undercut us and reduce our income are relentless and brutal.  
Yes, you as a programmer do deserve to make a decent living, no matter 
what you are told by people looking to save a buck or two.  Good luck!!

Most programmers on this esteemed list, including those who are located 
in remote areas of the U.S., agree that working for substantially less 
than $50 sets a bad example and undercuts a living wage for the whole 
lot of us.  I know many programmers outside of NYC who also earn the 
standard $50 an hour and I think that, for anyone of any reasonable 
expertise and experience, between $45-50 is a very reasonable benchmark 
and for costing out "lump sum" projects, the $2,000 a week figure is useful.

Bear in mind that for every hour we bill out, we also incur the cost of 
expenses, business losses through unpaid invoices, unpaid time spent 
marketing, bookkeeping etc.  In reality, billing at $25 an hour would 
lead to a poverty income for any consultant, unless they were 
consistently able to bill 60+ hours each & every week of the year, which 
is not a reasonable or pleasant expectation.

Hmm...good points Kristina and it brought up a few things I'd not
considered. Perhaps I need to raise my rates a bit.

NYC programmers should be charging much greater than $50/hour. What's
$50/hour after the Federal, State and Local governments get their cut? As a
consultant/part-timer/freelancer you'll be getting paid via 1099, which, at
least in NYC, will be taxed at up to 45%. I haven't worked in finance, but
when I've done parttime consulting, $150/hr was my going rate. In case
anyone is unsure, demand for programmers in many localities is very, very
high. In a hiring environment like this, there should be no reason to
devalue your work to win a contract.

Jake,

I agree totally, however the market won't bear those rates.  1099 income 
is subject to deductions for home office, travel expenses, meal expenses 
and the like and as such, has greater tax benefits than W2 income.  In 
actuality, in localities where there are few engineers, rates are 
higher.  NYC is packed to the gills with engineers seeking work.  A post 
on NYC Craig's List for a programmer nets 1,000 resumes in one DAY.   
Between the high cost of living and the low rates due to high 
concentration of available skilled workers, NYC's not a great place to 
be a programmer, for sure.

Believe me when I tell you, if there was any way for me to get more than 
$50/hr, I would have found it.  I loathe the situation and am looking to 
leave the field entirely in the near future.  For now, I slog it out and 
take what I can get.

I think we are talking about 2 different things here, one is programming and
the other is designing, Krista programmers in NYC make a lot more then $50
per hour, depending on your skill set and what language you program in. For
design work yes $50 per hour is about right for simple design work and even
that is in the lower end, and that can vary depending on the sort of design,
if it involves some sort of specialize CSS and or flash etc. then it goes
up.

That is incorrect.  Perhaps a few programmers at Wall Street firms are 
getting $90 an hour, but the going rate for normal folks here in NYC is 
about $50/hr.

Although for sure plenty of folks come onto the NYC list and try to 
undercut our rates...

Also "website redesign" is not usually programming but involves other 
skills (like CSS, graphics design, etc).  I would not be surprised to 
see rates differ between that and actual programming tasks.

Ed,

I've been a programmer in NYC for almost 13 years (maybe you assumed 
otherwise because of my gender), I started out in 1998 making $50 an 
hour, and I'm still making $50 an hour, and everyone else I know who is 
a PHP programmer in NYC is making between $45-55 an hour as well (over 
20 other people that I personally know and have worked with).

It's great to talk about what "should be" or what "could be" but the 
reality is, $50 an hour.

BTW even a cursory search on Dice.com or a talk with any reputable 
Technical Recruitment professional will show you that the average 
full-time salary for a programmer, of any type, in NYC, is about 90K a year.

This calculates out to, yep, about $50 an hour...including the cost of 
benefits, and assuming the full-timers have a workweek closer to 50 
hours per week (which most do).

Hi Kristina, 

No, no assumptions, I sure you are a good programmer, but every one I speak
to that are PHP programmers specially with as much experience as you have
are charging a lot more then $50 an hour lol.. Don't you think that after 13
years you have earned a raise? 

Than again I really charge more based on a project not so much per hour, but
when I do have to come back for what ever time to fix things or small
updates my rates start at $75 per hour. Heck if the geeksquad can charge
69.99 to set up a pc and $49.99 to set up an email account why would I
charge less than that lol .

Bottom line whether is selling your services or anything else it's only
worth as much as people are willing to pay for it. but in my opinion you
should not short change your worth, like I tell my soon to be clients and my
current clients, I may not be the least expensive but you get what you pay
for, and I can show clients how a lot of the work that I've have done has
paid for it self 10 fold if not more, so it's worth the investment and some
of them don't hire me at that time but do call me back to fix the mess some
one else makes and then I get to charge them more cause now I have to spend
time figuring out the mess that some one else made.

The agency I work for charges $125/hr for both design and programming. We're in north nj, and most of our clients are on the west coast.

I've done freelancing for clients in NYC and charged $125/hr successfully. A designer working for the same company charged $150/hr.

I think it depends on your skills and how well and efficiently you can get the job done. Not all people are willing to pay for quality, but those are the clients everyone prefers to work with.

Ed,

The reality of this economy is that small & medium sized businesses ARE 
NOT GOING TO PAY more than $2,000 a week for an engineer.

If you disagree, I mean, that's great, I'd love to make twice that but 
the reality is that if I ask for $4,000 a week, I'm going to be looking 
for work for A LONG TIME.  And $2,000 in US cash is worth far more than 
$4,000 in my fantasy world of what I'd "like to earn".

I'll even take $6,500 a month on occasion if the project is for someone 
I want to help.  I think that it's great to aim higher, I am all in 
favor of making the bucks, but in this economy $8,000 a month is A LOT 
in these company's minds.

I agree if someone is getting jerked around and asked for "small 
updates" (which I don't waste time with, I take on larger projects in 
the area of $5,000 + only), then yeah.  But the reality is, $8,000 a 
month is what people earn.   This is provable, this is reality, and 
fantasizing about making what lawyers make isn't going to change that 
reality.

The agency charges that to the client, and a lot of "interactive 
agencies" charge exorbitant rates for garbage websites, but very little 
of that is actually going into the pockets of hardworking programmers.

Again I've heard many tales of programmers supposedly getting these 
rates, but in real life, I don't know anyone.  (However I DO know of a 
lot of "interactive agencies" that have gone bankrupt and/or lost 
clients due to charging those sorts of rates...)

Maybe it is like the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot...? :-)

Anthony et al:

Kristina knows her stuff and charges accordingly. I would listen to her.

You will always find clients who say they can find professional 
developers for much less than what you charge no matter what you 
charge -- that goes with the territory. You have to understand that 
you either stand your ground, or comply, but you are the one who has 
to live with the decision.

I had one client, back when I charged on $50/hour (I now charge 
$100/hour), say to me "$50 and hour!!! I never paid that much for 
anything. Would you considering working for $25 per hour?" I replied, 
"Sure, but it will take me twice as long to get anything done."

The client didn't hire me, but a year later he came back asking me 
the same question and complaining that he couldn't find a good 
developer. Some clients learn slow.

Cheers,

tedd

If you're talking about a fulltime job you  can't compare that because your employer is paying half your s/s plus other benefits and you get paid for nonbillable time. I don't know any consultant in the NYC area who is billing less than $75/hr

Tedd - Thanks, and this is good news!

  What you say about it then "taking twice as long to get it done" is so 
true.  Hourly rates are based on what we negotiate with the client.  
Unless the client is sitting there with a stopwatch clocking your every 
move (a rare situation), there really isn't any realistic way the client 
can be absolutely certain how many hours were spent.  So what it comes 
down to is
(a) what's the client's perception of the work you've done and how long 
it "should" take [this is why it's known that any client who says "oh, 
this should not take more than 4 or 5 hours" is no client we want to have],
(b) how big is the project?  Billing $50 for 200 hours is 10K, billing 
$100 for 5 hours is $500.  Some clients are just not worth dealing with 
when the hassle/payout ratio is examined; and
(c) what are ways you can increase your actual income without giving the 
appearance that you are charging more?  Reusing code, leveraging 
contacts with existing clients to create new business, cutting deals "OK 
I'll give you a break here but next time, please be prepared to pay 
market rates", limiting time wasted on non-billable phone calls, etc.

I know I've learned most of this stuff the hard way and had many 
misadventures over the years.  I've smartened up considerably about who 
I deal with, how I negotiate and what I will tolerate from clients, but 
also learned that sometimes if you do cut someone a deal [within reason 
of course!], they'll never forget it and will be invaluable allies in 
the future.

Also, how steady/big is the contract?

My last contract was a 30 day contract at dayrate that was less than 1/9th
the rate I charge for adhoc consulting. and more than the previous contract
position. However, it was a 30 day contract that lasted almost a year, and
my headhunter paid me with a W-2. Therefore, my biggest concern was
compensating for a lack of benefits compared with the salary.

BTW, I was told dayrate was based on a 9 hour day. It was a new  concept to
me, but it worked out well.

The higher the bill rate, the less hours you can bill, the less clients 
you will have, and the harder you will work for that same amount.  You 
will spend more than 1/2 of your time on marketing because you will be 
competing for a bite of a very small pie.

My phone is ringing off the hook and I can pick & choose what I want to 
work on.  So for me, and for my clients, this rate works.  I know if 
they could afford to pay me $3,000 a week instead of $2,000, they 
would.  But they really cannot afford it in most cases.  I deal with the 
small biz market primarily.

And again, the tax burden on a W2 employee is MUCH GREATER since you 
cannot deduct transportation, meals, office space, utilities, etc etc etc.
You pay taxes on the entirety of what you make.
As a self employed person, after all legal deductions are figured and 
accounted for, the tax burden is truly negligible if you know your tax 
rules.  AND I can take a month off whenever I choose!  Can't beat that.

Kristina,
Ok now I get where you are coming from, see we where taking about 2
different situations, I very rarely take jobs that require me to go into the
clients office for X amount of time every day. 

I like to take projects I will give the client an estimated date of
completion and update him accordingly. So if it takes me 3 weeks or 3 months
the quote that I gave him stands unless he asks for extra features. I live
in Long Island so for me to go into the city for less then $75 per hour is
not really worth it cause I have to account for the 2.5 hour commute time
every day that's over 12 per week that I'm loosing, I know a lot of people
don't count their commute time cause that's just part of the job, but I take
everything into account when taking a job, hey that time is time that I
could be spending with my family and that's worth a lot more then $75 per
hour.

But again to each its own, it seems like you are doing well and are happy
with your rates and many others here who are charging more are doing well
and happy also. So I guess the lesson here is that there is a market for
every one. One thing though, one reason why I don't charge less and always
try to stand my ground is because some time back when I used to charged less
some companies actually wouldn't hire me because they thought that since I
wasn't charging them as much I probably was not as good!! Go figure, ones I
raised my rates I got more jobs :) people are strange.

Ed,

The reality of this economy is that small & medium sized businesses ARE 
NOT GOING TO PAY more than $2,000 a week for an engineer.

If you disagree, I mean, that's great, I'd love to make twice that but 
the reality is that if I ask for $4,000 a week, I'm going to be looking 
for work for A LONG TIME.  And $2,000 in US cash is worth far more than 
$4,000 in my fantasy world of what I'd "like to earn".

I'll even take $6,500 a month on occasion if the project is for someone 
I want to help.  I think that it's great to aim higher, I am all in 
favor of making the bucks, but in this economy $8,000 a month is A LOT 
in these company's minds.

I agree if someone is getting jerked around and asked for "small 
updates" (which I don't waste time with, I take on larger projects in 
the area of $5,000 + only), then yeah.  But the reality is, $8,000 a 
month is what people earn.   This is provable, this is reality, and 
fantasizing about making what lawyers make isn't going to change that 
reality.

My comments...

I know programmers in NYC (straight up php developers) who make anywhere between about $22/hr (junior) to about $66/hr (senior). 

However, any NYC developer I know who also has systems/DBA skills (even slight) regularly pulls in at least $70/hr, rarely less.

BTW even a cursory search on Dice.com or a talk with any reputable 
Technical Recruitment professional will show you that the average 
full-time salary for a programmer, of any type, in NYC, is about 90K a year.

This calculates out to, yep, about $50 an hour...including the cost of 
benefits, and assuming the full-timers have a workweek closer to 50 
hours per week (which most do).

Ed,

More than 90% of what I do is from my office here in my apartment, 
although on rare occasion I will work onsite if requested and if in the 
mood to get out a bit.
Gives me an excuse to wear my fancy threads, right?

My clients are small businesses and if they could afford to pay me 
$3,000 a week, I know most of them would gladly do so.  But in this 
economy, most of them scrape to come up with $2,000 a week.  I am deeply 
suspicious of consultants who claim to bill out over $12,000 a month 
since I have been around and know the deal...

$100 an hour is great but in many cases, you're not even approaching 40 
hours or even 20 hours a week in billings.  Any programmer should be 
good enough with math to see that consistent billing of 40 hours per 
week and less time spent on marketing is the key to greater monthly income.

In '99, I was making $70-85/hr as an Oracle/C Programmer.

The interesting thing is how much more you have to know to be a web 
developer, especially if you work on the front end and the backend.

Know more, less money.

In 1999 I knew basically not a whole lot, I was a green a** newbie with 
some Javascript skills and a liberal arts degree, and I pulled 
$50/hr....true story! LOL.

Know more, less money, you got it!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Pricing a PHP product
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=Y=h7guyXg+881+9cU-KqvigXrjA@mail.gmail.com>

So since the topic of what to charge per hour seems to be being
vigoriously discussed, I thought I'd throw something out there that's
bugged me for a while.

How to price a PHP product.

I'm starting my third PHP product (an appointment reminder for a
software system I wrote) and I'm having a lot of problems coming up
with a price. I don't want to set it too low, like I seem to have done
with my rates, but I don't want to over price it either.

The system is straight PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, and HTML, so it's not
anything terribly complex but it does provider a nice extension to the
existing software.

What is the best way to price such software?

Thanks!
Anthony

Interesting discussion, but what baffles me beyond repair is how much more 
developers are paid compared to QA or support staff. The difficulty of work is 
about the same, although for a support job I think it is even higher (think 
about it, the supporters have to defend what the developers goofed up). The 
skill set is somewhat different, but thinking about what I get as a veteran QA 
Analyst and the hourly rates you are discussing makes me just wanna cry. OK, 
in all fairness, I'm not working in City, but upstate. Still, I think that if 
you can steadily land jobs that pay 50$ an hour you are doing quite well.

Been programming in nyc for 10 years now.

The average rate for senior PHP development is 50-100 an hour. I've been to
a few receiving rates of 75 an hour

You are wrong. The work of a qa analyst is alot simpler. You don't need to
do any architecture based on traffic retention, judge framework usage etc.

Not saying your tasks are easier or less stressful.

But, I guess you can look at senior devs/leads as the architect of the
house, and your the house inspector.

Get what I mean? Not saying one out weighs the other, just one is more
involved in architecture, and the other is involved in making sure it meets
city requirements aka business reqs.

The decision on what to build comes down from on high where some confab 
of management pinheads make decisions based on "wow this will make us 
rich if we hire some cheap labor to build it for us" and "my Uncle Frank 
told me PHP was the way to go while we were golfing last week".

The tech lead then assembles a team of inexperienced, cheap programmers 
(because management has decided the budget, too) who crank out a 
horrifying batch of really awful code that kind of looks like it might 
do what management requested be built, with the tech lead taking all the 
credit for anything good that might happen along the way, and blaming 
the programmers he personally likes the least for whatever bad things 
inevitably occur.

This poo poo stew then gets dumped into the lap of our hapless "QA 
Analyst" who is expected to work a miracle on par with parting the Red 
Sea by turning it into Tasty Texas Chili for distribution to the masses.

A lead is a mentor. It is unfortunate if you work in a place where the lead
blames others.

I never did such a thing and always gave credit.

You as a lead decide who is on your team and fight for that, for the same
crappy code you mention I always hire mid to senior level otherwise I am
going to spend more time hot fixing mistakes and training than getting the
project done correctly.

Not going to address the PHP comment ;)

We'd have to ask David to clarify, but from what he's posted, his

That's exactly right.

Most of my projects are done a "cost for project" basis.

Often I figure out how much time the project will take me and then I 
provide the client with a "project cost", which usually looks like a 
better deal for them because I *do* charge $100 per hour.

For example, I'm current working on a project that if I spent all my 
time (100%) working on it I probably could have it done in two weeks. 
That would be $8K at $100 per hour.

However, in this case (which is more often than not) I determined 
that the client can't be ready in that length of time -- they simply 
don't have the graphics, text, and money. So, I provide a quote 
saying I can finish the project within two months at cost of $10k. 
That gives them time to get things together and gives me room to fit 
their project in to my schedule.

If they come back and negotiate, then I have $2k of wiggle room. 
However most of the time, clients jump at the "project cost" for they 
feel that two months is much longer than 100 hours so they are 
getting something additional. Realize that often it perception and 
flexibility that you sell, not programming. In any event, the 
arrangement presents a win-win situation -- and that's what you want.

So, when the client has the money, I take 50% up-front and the 
remainder when the project is finished. It sounds reasonable to the 
client and works most of the time for me.

Now, what I *also* do in these cases is to stay with the client until 
they get what they want. This conduct will provide me with favor, 
which results in more work from both the client and their friends. 
Word of mouth means a lot!

Sometimes, this means spending up to 50% more time than expected 
without billing for extras. However, at some point, the client should 
come to a realization what the scope of the project was at the 
beginning and what it turned into. Most clients realize what "feature 
creep" is and you can come to a reasonable solution as to how to deal 
with it.

If you run into an unreasonable client (rare), then it's best to take 
whatever was outstanding and walk away -- don't do the court thing. 
As for an unreasonable example, I had one client who offered to pay 
me $50 *per week* until the project was finished as he kept adding 
things as if this project was a software buffet. I walked and left 
the remaining 50% payment plus the 150% effort on the table. In this 
case, I made $33 per hour on a failed project. Not good, but not so 
bad either.

The bottom line is to determine what the client wants and work their 
needs to your advantage. It may sound like you're taking advantage of 
them, but clients seldom understand and often underestimate what you 
do and that is taking advantage of you. In the end, work the system 
to provide quality service for reasonable pay.

Know more, less money. <-- not necessarily.

"Knowing more" simply means "more opportunity".

I have had many clients who come to me wanting a simple billboard -- 
I can do that. I typically charge $1k for a three page web site and 
can create a decent looking one in a day. I'll do that as often as 
anyone wants.

I know people who charge considerably more and remarkably less. So, 
there's no "rule of thumb" -- so surmise the client, determine your 
own worth, and charge accordingly.

Not meaning to degrade "Support", but those positions as usually the 
first step in IT -- are they not?

As such, it's like minimum wage with higher wages as they move up.

Been there, done that and was important, because shortly after the developers 
got laid off and knowing how to fix things was very helpful in supporting the 
product. But QA people must have sufficient development skills, at least 
enough to know when the developers are just being lazy. How many times have I 
heard "this will take three weeks" just to have it get done in half an hour 
after insisting on a fix (because I knew it wasn't rocket science to fix it). 
Or the whiny "this cannot be done in X" with X being any programming language 
used for a project. Of course it can be done! The dev was just too lazy to 
google for the code snippet or look at the other places in the app where the 
exact same functionality exists and works flawlessly. Many bright minds 
pointed out in the past that QA must own the design and requirements, because 
they are the ones who know best when it is stupid, won't work, or isn't worth 
the effort.

I'm not knocking the developers in general. Many I work and worked with have 
excellent skills and a superb understanding of the business, but - 
understandably so - are not keen on tedious work such as bug fixing, writing 
tech docs, or analyzing requirements. Some tend to code whatever they are 
asked to code, even if they know it is dumb. That is why smart businesses 
outsource coding work to Russia, Hungary or Bulgaria. Sure, the developers 
there are not as cheap as the ones in India, but they tend to ask the tough 
questions.

As for QA, QA is nothing more than a mirror developers have to look into.

Hi Anthony,

This is impossible to answer without intimate knowledge of the product
(and I apologize in advance for saying I don't care to know).

But if the M/O of the product is your typical business application
running as an HTTP service accessed by potentially many clients, then
the low end would probably be around $500 USD. That's about what it
takes to cover the costs of just helping people get setup and
collecting payment. If the product is a little side component like a
plugin for something then you might make it less but your margins in
this case are going to be poor. If you're app is something small and
you're thinking about a price like $100 or less, don't waste your
time. You need to write something that is useful enough to reach that
$500 range. If the application is really good and solves an important
business need, it is not unreasonable to charge $10,000 or an annual
fee of $1500 or so (but my guess is that you're not in this upper
range because it would probably be something that requires a
significant amount of man hours in which case you would have one
product and not three). Again it really depends a lot on what the
product does and how well it does it. If your software is really good
at something, customers will gladly buy it and they will not care much
if it's $200 or $500. Most developers / operators are not paying for
this stuff themselves. They're just doing an evaluation and submitting
a purchase order. You have to get to about $1000 before someone is
going to ask "why?".

And of course customers are going to expect a trial package that
doesn't cost anything. And customers demand options. You must have a
trial version that costs $0. And even after the trial expires I
recommend leaving that installation functional in some limited way. Of
course you can also have a version limited to a certain number of
users say for $300 as opposed to a "platinum" version for $600 or
whatever. I provide a lot of pricing options. I have a separate
"confidential" document for each product that I attach to every sales
email query which describes all of the pricing options about
discounts, the cost of versions limited to a certain number of users,
reseller conditions and so on. You can make a lot more money if the
options are structured well. For example, I have a simple formula (and
corresponding easy to read price table) that increases the discount as
the number of installations goes up. I think this scheme alone has
accounted for significantly larger invoice prices.

Another thing you can do is to make the debut price less than the
ultimate target price to leave room for increases. After a few months
when you have a better idea of who the customer's are, what they want
and the product has matured a little, you can decide to go higher
depending on the software's popularity, the economy, etc. Then when
you do a major revision 2 years later maybe you increase again.

Good luck,

Mike

Hi Anthony,

This is impossible to answer without intimate knowledge of the product
(and I apologize in advance for saying I don't care to know).

But if the M/O of the product is your typical business application
running as an HTTP service accessed by potentially many clients, then
the low end would probably be around $500 USD. That's about what it
takes to cover the costs of just helping people get setup and
collecting payment. If the product is a little side component like a
plugin for something then you might make it less but your margins in
this case are going to be poor. If you're app is something small and
you're thinking about a price like $100 or less, don't waste your
time. You need to write something that is useful enough to reach that
$500 range. If the application is really good and solves an important
business need, it is not unreasonable to charge $10,000 or an annual
fee of $1500 or so (but my guess is that you're not in this upper
range because it would probably be something that requires a
significant amount of man hours in which case you would have one
product and not three). Again it really depends a lot on what the
product does and how well it does it. If your software is really good
at something, customers will gladly buy it and they will not care much
if it's $200 or $500. Most developers / operators are not paying for
this stuff themselves. They're just doing an evaluation and submitting
a purchase order. You have to get to about $1000 before someone is
going to ask "why?".

And of course customers are going to expect a trial package that
doesn't cost anything. And customers demand options. You must have a
trial version that costs $0. And even after the trial expires I
recommend leaving that installation functional in some limited way. Of
course you can also have a version limited to a certain number of
users say for $300 as opposed to a "platinum" version for $600 or
whatever. I provide a lot of pricing options. I have a separate
"confidential" document for each product that I attach to every sales
email query which describes all of the pricing options about
discounts, the cost of versions limited to a certain number of users,
reseller conditions and so on. You can make a lot more money if the
options are structured well. For example, I have a simple formula (and
corresponding easy to read price table) that increases the discount as
the number of installations goes up. I think this scheme alone has
accounted for significantly larger invoice prices.

Another thing you can do is to make the debut price less than the
ultimate target price to leave room for increases. After a few months
when you have a better idea of who the customer's are, what they want
and the product has matured a little, you can decide to go higher
depending on the software's popularity, the economy, etc. Then when
you do a major revision 2 years later maybe you increase again.

Good luck,

Mike

That's exactly right.
 
Most of my projects are done a "cost for project" basis.
 
Often I figure out how much time the project will take me and then I 
provide the client with a "project cost", which usually looks like a 
better deal for them because I *do* charge $100 per hour.
 
For example, I'm current working on a project that if I spent all my 
time (100%) working on it I probably could have it done in two weeks. 
That would be $8K at $100 per hour.
 
However, in this case (which is more often than not) I determined 
that the client can't be ready in that length of time -- they simply 
don't have the graphics, text, and money. So, I provide a quote 
saying I can finish the project within two months at cost of $10k. 
That gives them time to get things together and gives me room to fit 
their project in to my schedule.
 
If they come back and negotiate, then I have $2k of wiggle room. 
However most of the time, clients jump at the "project cost" for they 
feel that two months is much longer than 100 hours so they are 
getting something additional. Realize that often it perception and 
flexibility that you sell, not programming. In any event, the 
arrangement presents a win-win situation -- and that's what you want.
 
So, when the client has the money, I take 50% up-front and the 
remainder when the project is finished. It sounds reasonable to the 
client and works most of the time for me.
 
Now, what I *also* do in these cases is to stay with the client until 
they get what they want. This conduct will provide me with favor, 
which results in more work from both the client and their friends. 
Word of mouth means a lot!
 
Sometimes, this means spending up to 50% more time than expected 
without billing for extras. However, at some point, the client should 
come to a realization what the scope of the project was at the 
beginning and what it turned into. Most clients realize what "feature 
creep" is and you can come to a reasonable solution as to how to deal 
with it.
 
If you run into an unreasonable client (rare), then it's best to take 
whatever was outstanding and walk away -- don't do the court thing. 
As for an unreasonable example, I had one client who offered to pay 
me $50 *per week* until the project was finished as he kept adding 
things as if this project was a software buffet. I walked and left 
the remaining 50% payment plus the 150% effort on the table. In this 
case, I made $33 per hour on a failed project. Not good, but not so 
bad either.
 
The bottom line is to determine what the client wants and work their 
needs to your advantage. It may sound like you're taking advantage of 
them, but clients seldom understand and often underestimate what you 
do and that is taking advantage of you. In the end, work the system 
to provide quality service for reasonable pay.
 
Cheers,
 
tedd

Are you kidding me?

What you are referring to is "Price Fixing". That is when 
like-service companies (i.e., Airlines) call each other and determine 
a basic set rate instead of letting competition determine the price.

That is not what we are doing here! You are free to charge whatever 
you want -- I don't care. No one is agreeing to a set-price for 
set-labor PERIOD. I'll let the Congress do that in determining 
minimum wage -- they seem to break every other law.

Now, if the government wants to shut me up about what I charge, then 
they are free to try. But they have to figure out how to get around 
the first amendment, which supports my right to free speech. That's 
bigger than them.

As far as I'm concerned, the government can take a long walk off a 
short pier. Besides, regardless of who they think they are, they 
haven't done anything to promote business, nor do they know how. They 
are just a bunch of clowns throwing our money at their ideas.

Sorry for the rant. :-)

So, the answer is "No" we are not breaking any law taking about our 
experiences with clients.

Cheers,

tedd

The fact that someone is even worried that what we do here is "breaking 
the law" is indicative of our giant leap as a society towards total 
fascism and paranoia.

When it becomes illegal to wear cheesy t-shirts with penguins on them, 
or eat cold pizza before noon...then we might have a problem here.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Writing daemons in PHP
Message-ID: <4D9E2EC2.6090007@gmail.com>

Just wondering what, in general, others are using for writing daemons in
PHP.

Just code it directly using libevent...   or using a framework such as
phpdaemon, https://github.com/kakserpom/phpdaemon


For a first pass, I need to set up a more intelligent CPULimit app to
meet my specific goals.  Since all CPULimit basically does is check all
the PID's every 2ms and send out kill to processes with SIGSTOP and
SIGCONT - it seems simple to do the same with PHP.

Just loop through every 2 ms and when cpu usage is over the threshold,
do some quick calcs to determine how many microseconds before the
processes can be continued in order to drop the cpu usage below the
threshold and use libevent to set the callback time.

Granted, this is supposedly "better" to program in C rather than PHP,
but since I want to be able to do quick changes and keep the learning
curve small, I'd rather do it in PHP until everything has been tweaked
and perfected.  Then it's always an option to try using HipHop to
convert it.... or if it is running well and doing what is needed, leave
it be.

I don't have knowledge or expertise in this area but I have written a 
few things in node.js and using upstart to control the jobs.  However 
doing my own research on how to write a daemon in PHP you should check 
out http://simas.posterous.com/writing-a-php-daemon-application.
