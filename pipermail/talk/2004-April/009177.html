No. It's marketing. Think of the DSLAM as a big mongo network switch
(which it is). If you have a 10Mbps uplink to your office switch,
and 24 ports of 10mbps to each of 24 computers, yes, each of them
has a *dedicated 10 mbps line&quot;. Guess what? They all share the
same uplink. Now, most DSL providers ( like Verizon 'can you heaer me 
now? WHAT?') do OC3 or better for the COs, it's still shared.

Cable, on the other hand, will suffer more from local abuse, since the
*local medium* (coax) is shared, so the potential of local abusers
affecting the throughput for others in greater. However, providers
throttle the abusers after a time, so wait it out for 20-30 minutes
until the local clown gets bandwidth-capped at 128k. :)

Right. It all gets down to where the sharing is done, and how it's
provisioned. I have a 384/1500 link from cloud9, and I bet that when I
pull large files for long times, that 1.5mbps affects the home surfers.

PS: Just to qualify my statements, I know a little about this stuff,
as I own/operate Coastal Internet (www.buoy.com).
