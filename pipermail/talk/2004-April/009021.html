<PRE>Hey everyone:

Just beginning to think about this stuff as I will probably take the 
opportunity to make my classes more rigid inside the new PHP5 class 
structure, and think a little better about how they're set up, and so 
forth.  Unlike many of you, I don't have the luxuries of large 
development teams inside a large organization, because I am dealing 
with very small clients (usually non-profit), and so I have to 
structure things as simply as possible for myself, to just save 
myself time.

I am not using PHP5, nor will I until the actual final version has 
been out for quite a while.  But, I stay on top of what's happening 
and had some questions for people who have played with a little.

Specifically, what does everyone think of the bundling of SQL Lite 
into PHP5?  My own publishing framework has been based on MySQL/PHP, 
but I was beginning to investigate the advantages of SQL Lite for 
small projects, and specifically how it integrates with PHP5.


Cheers,
