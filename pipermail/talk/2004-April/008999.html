<PRE>

&quot;Tim Gales&quot; says:
...
&gt;<i> &gt; Another important practical distinction is that a high-level 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language is presumably portable between different computers. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who is doing the presuming in your view? 
</I>
I am, but I think this is not an uncommon view of a key advantage of
high-level languages.

&gt;<i> A language author creates a language to be useful.
</I>
At least in the case of C, a component of that usefulness was
portability across platforms, and I think today it is commonly
expected that portability across platforms is a key aspect of the
utility of high-level languages.  

Kernighan and Ritchie, the authors of C say about C in their classic
book &quot;The C Programming Languages&quot;, 2nd ed., in the introduction:
&quot;Although C matches the capabilities of many computers, it is
independent of any particular machine architecture.  With a little
care, it is easy to write portable programs, that is, programs that
can be run without change on a variety of hardware.  The standard
makes portability issues explicit, and prescribes a set of constants
that characterize the machine on which the program is run.&quot;

I think the last sentence pertinent to the ANSI standard is
particularly telling -- portability, which was implicit in the
language from very early on was made explicit in the standardization
process of the 70s - 80s. 

I am humbled to report, in the spirit of full disclosure, that the
text in the preface describes C as 'not a &quot;very high level&quot; language',
and the text in the introduction describes it thus: &quot;C is a relatively
'low level' language.&quot;

So we seem to be in a semantic muddle.  Perhaps the correct
description would be: C is a standardized, portable relatively low
level language for a high level language which is not a very high
level language.

Maybe C would best be thought of as a middle level language; we could
call it a &quot;mezzanine&quot; language.

&gt;<i> If he/she is successful, i.e. the language proves to be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful, other people port it to their systems so they 
</I>&gt;<i> can also take advantage of it.
</I>
Or in the caes of K&amp;R, I believe they did the first couple of ports
themselves.

&gt;<i> Maybe some authors of languages have a design goal of not 
</I>&gt;<i> burning any bridges when it comes to portability -- since
</I>
In the case of K&amp;R they were going for portability from early on so
that they could easily move this large program they had written called
&quot;Unix&quot; from one computer to another without having to rewrite huge
chunks of it ever time.

...
&gt;<i> different types of systems, but by and large computer languages 
</I>&gt;<i> are created to get something done in one environment.
</I>
You may be right, but I don't believe that's the case with C/C++ and
Perl, to name just a few.

&gt;<i> Even Java, which now even runs on my cell phone, was designed to 
</I>&gt;<i> run in a closed environment -- namely set top boxes.
</I>
Well, this is a simplification.  The first prototype of Java (called
&quot;Oak&quot;) was meant to run on a variety of set-top boxes (to get ready
for the coming &quot;digital convergence&quot;).  It was meant to be processor
independent but to present a consistent programming environment and
language.  Evidently a contingent at Sun expected that something that
would be sort of a hybrid between cable modems, web tv,
movies-on-demand, and TiVO, probably working over the internet, was
going to be the next big thing in 1991.  Not completely wrong, but not
exactly right.

...
&gt;<i> &gt; The definition of a compiler or interpreter or virtual 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine includes the ability to read source code in a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high-level language and generate correct executable programs 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for different kinds of computers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, I don't think portability has anything to do 
</I>&gt;<i> with being a high-level language.
</I>
Well, I think it's a commonly associated feature, and a non-portable
high-level language would be a gross exception.  I suppose a vehicle
doesn't have to have seats to be a car, and I don't know if the
definition of &quot;car&quot; should include the idea that there are seats in
it, but it seems to me to be the convention.  Similarly, I think
portability is a commonly expected advantage to high level languages.

Of course none of this applies to C, since we have established, from
the words of its creators, that it is a mezzanine language.
