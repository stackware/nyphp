 Wait 'til you get a defective modem with them.
 My experience was it took what seemed like an eternity 
 of pleading with the support personnel to 'take my word for it' 
 that the modem's dead. They wanted to exhaustively try falling back 
 to different device drivers. 

 He (the initial support guy) said, &quot;Let's just try one thing first&quot;.
 So I patiently followed his step-by-step instructions. 
 Then I realized where we were headed, and that he wanted me to 
 rip out the device driver and put in an older one.

 I told him, &quot;Whoa there partner, all the installing of 
 software in the world's not going to help me -- the 
 modem doesn't make it past the self-test after power-up.
 After wrangling with him for another amount of time, he 
 finally let me talk to his supervisor.

 He (the supervisor) said, &quot;Let's just try one thing first...&quot;
