<PRE>In all my research for ad serving software, I've found one thing they
all have in common. Nothing is guaranteed. I can't see me paying for
software with no guarantee that it will work. I've had my issues with
phpAdsNew, but I've found it to handle my needs. Like I said, I've
served over 1 million banners with it in a day.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHPAds New


Although the last build (2.0) was Sept 2003 doesn't mean that the
software itself is bad. Just development has stalled.

I was looking into ad software and phpadsnew seems to be the best free
opensource solution you'll find out there (by far). That said, I haven't
deployed it on what is a highly traffic'd site so I don't know what the
performance would be.

But there are plenty of optimizations you can make. You can store the
banners either in the DB or on the HD, you can enable caches to speed up
the delivery along with a ton of other tweaks.

Statistic reporting is also variable and you can turn off certain
logging features if you're worried about large lurking DB's running
around.

There was a post yesterday in the forums by the lead developer, seems
he's simply gotten more involved in writting backends for Groklaw.

&quot;I hope to have some more time soon and I am thinking about releasing
phpAdsNew 2.01 in the nearby future.&quot;

Anyway, I'm thinking of still going forward with this software the
documention is top-notch for any software (free or not) and makes it
hard to believe it couldn't handle a decent amount of traffic. Other
than that are there any reccomendations for commercial solutions for ad
software?
