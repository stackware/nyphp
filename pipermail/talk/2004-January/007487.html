I haven't seen anything geared directly towards this, but it can 
definitely be done.

The approach I like to take when building my applications is to try and 
design all my database related code to be able to work with any number 
of columns:

function load ($id)
{
	$sql = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id=' $db-&gt;qstr ($id);
	$rs = $db-&gt;SelectLimit ($sql,1);
	if ( !is_object ($rs) )
	{
		return FALSE;
	}
	
	return $rs-&gt;FetchRow ();
}

That is a fairly basic example, but you see that you can simply add an 
extra field in the database and it will automatically be added.

Another approach to this problem from a database perspective is to add a 
table to hold these extra pieces of data, with columns id, att and val. 
  That gets a little more complicated in the load and save routines, but 
is very good when you have extra data which is only applicable to a 
small subset of your objects.

As for the forms, I did write an app a while ago which could generate 
multipage forms from definitions stored in a database, which would allow 
them to be edited through a web interface, that approach worked very 
well for me, might even be able to dig up a copy if anyone is interested...
