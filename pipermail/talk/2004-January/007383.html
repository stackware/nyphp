I guess it is about what you are interested in. If you need to buy
software for your company then yes you probably your would be more
interested in the business section. Wondering around the place I
wondered what all those people seating through all the boring
presentation did. I guess they probably are not much interested in
linux's open source roots.

Out of curiousity I walked over to Oracle side and asked to see a demo
of one of their &quot;Big and expensive applications&quot;. They were more then
happy to direct me to the project manager of one of their &quot;Big and
expensive applications&quot;, who gave me a demo and who I got a chance to
ask a bunch of questions on what he does at oracle to how he considers
people for hiring.  They didn't seem to mind at all that I was taking
their time because not that much people where around by end of the
day anyway. 

Anyway the companies come there to sell and the techies are just part of
it there is something for everyone.
