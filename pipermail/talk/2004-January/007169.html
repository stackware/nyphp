<PRE>Here at work we use a MS Exchange 2000 server, which was installed recently. The one thing that they disabled was SMTP access unless you were logged into the domain, and they had to disable that to allow PHP to send emails. I am sure that we can make it &quot;log on&quot; to the mail server, but right now we decided not to.

Here is my php.ini settings:
SMTP is set to 172.17.1.13 (Internal Email server IP Address, not addressable from the internet)
sendmail_from is set to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">php at thompsonhealth.org</A> (an alias that I created for my account)
sendmail_path is blank.

I can create an email message with those settings just by doing:
mail(&quot;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">keith.richardson at thompsonhealth.org</A>&quot;,&quot;this is a test subject&quot;,&quot;This is a test message&quot;);

and it will send an email to myself.

maybe it is a problem with your email address not being on the exchange server, so it denys email messages sending through it from you? I would believe that this is some setting in exchange that is blocking you.

[mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">talk-bounces at lists.nyphp.org</A>]On Behalf Of Jeff Siegel

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT: Unable to receive mail


I'm having what might be called a long-running &quot;feud&quot; with a client. 
Their computer tech claims the problem is in my code...I claim the 
problem is in their mail server. Here's the scenario.

A PHP form sends out two emails upon completion: one to the client and a 
confirmation copy to the person who filled out the form. If I use my own 
email address in place of my client's address, I always receive the 
emails that come from the form. If I substitute my client's address as 
the recipient, the client never receives the email.

I suspect that the problem lies in the configuration of the client's 
mail server, namely MS Exchange Server, that has a number of things shut 
down (or perhaps, filtered is the right term) so that spammers don't use 
their mail server. (Yes, this happened to them...some spammer figured 
out that they could use their mail server to send out a zillion emails.)

Below is a copy of the message headers. What I think is happening is 
that whatever they've configured in Exchange Server prevents a message 
with these headers from getting through.

Any help with this is greatly appreciated.

1) hofweb8.com is the ISP's mail server.
2) &quot;website.com&quot; doesn't exist...it's a bogus name
