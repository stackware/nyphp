<PRE>I signed up as well, and it has been just fine.  They don't require a credit
card, and using a pre-registered domain name is free.  Also, there is an
option the control panel to notify you (it may even be disable, I don't
remember) if the costs exceed an amount - I set mine to $1.00.  Not that I
have been charged (or asked to pay) for anything, just thought I would pass
that along.

Also has traffic monitoring, and the really nice thing that it comes with is
a newsletter system, which you can send out 1000 (opt-in) emails per month,
plus they give you a mechanism to do adds/removes from your list.

I don't have any complains so far.

I signed up, and haven't had to pay anything. I pointed a domain at it, have
used the database and PHP, and it has been very nice so far. Here's my junky
looking site if you'd like to take a look at my attempt at humor:
