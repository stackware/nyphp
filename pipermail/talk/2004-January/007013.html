<PRE>You bring up some good points.

Suppose the card numbers and the personal information are stolen and
then used to make purchases with other vendors. What you saying the
other vendors are the once who really get screwed at this point ?

Felix

&gt;<i> David,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know you are not going to want to here this answer, but I say do
</I>&gt;<i> NOTHING, and here's why:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are a contractor (I'm assuming), you are paid to do what you are
</I>&gt;<i> told. What you are doing is not illegal, and you can provide
</I>&gt;<i> documentation (I assume you have sent her email about this) that you
</I>&gt;<i> have informed her of the risks.  I see no harm in asking her to sign
</I>&gt;<i> something, but you are not liable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am someone who is on the other end of this, meaning that I process
</I>&gt;<i> orders(over 100 a day) and frequently have to screen for fraudulent
</I>&gt;<i> use of credit cards that we take over our websites.  MANY times we
</I>&gt;<i> have contacted local authorities and Credit Card Companies with proof
</I>&gt;<i> of fraudulent use (both in the US and worldwide) of a particular card
</I>&gt;<i> (used to purchase our products). The sad reality is that no one
</I>&gt;<i> actually cares.  Ultimately, it is the vendor of the product who will
</I>&gt;<i> have to eat the charge.  Why?  Because the Vendor needs their merchant
</I>&gt;<i> account to sell products, the customer will just get another credit
</I>&gt;<i> card if they feel they are treated unfairly.  The Credit Card
</I>&gt;<i> companies just pressures the vendor into eating the charge, or else
</I>&gt;<i> they get their rates raises, which can hurt business badly.  Because
</I>&gt;<i> of this, we have focused our efforts in developing checks to help
</I>&gt;<i> insure that we don't charge(and ship products for) a misused card.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, in the eyes of the CC companies, they don't care if you are
</I>&gt;<i> keeping cards safe of people who have purchased your products.  What
</I>&gt;<i> they really care about is false charges on one of their cards.  The
</I>&gt;<i> whole idea is turned on its head.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I commend you for wanting to add security, and agree that it should be
</I>&gt;<i> there.  Personally, I think she doesn't want to upset her applecart by
</I>&gt;<i> learning something new, and probably doesn't want to pay you for the
</I>&gt;<i> work required to do this.  How we get around this is by offering these
</I>&gt;<i> methods as the only solution in the beginning, so the client start off
</I>&gt;<i> immediately with these features, and they accept &quot;that's just how it
</I>&gt;<i> is&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good Luck,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tom
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">talk-bounces at lists.nyphp.org</A>]On Behalf Of David Mintz
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Wednesday, January 07, 2004 4:27 PM
</I>&gt;<i> To: NYPHP Talk
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [nycphp-talk] client doesn't want security: what to do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A developer -- let's called him yours truly -- has had a nagging
</I>&gt;<i> problem for a while. Client -- let's call her C -- has websites,
</I>&gt;<i> hosted on a shared server, that collect sensitive info. Said info is
</I>&gt;<i> written to a database for temporary storage -- up to a couple weeks,
</I>&gt;<i> then wiped out via a cron job whether C has gotten around to getting
</I>&gt;<i> it or not. C logs onto to an SSL-encrypted password-protected page to
</I>&gt;<i> fetch info. Yours truly has made every effort to make this system as
</I>&gt;<i> secure as possible under the circumstances -- e.g., running PHP in cgi
</I>&gt;<i> mode and making all the permissions as restrictive as possible, using
</I>&gt;<i> SSL, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, yours truly thinks it would be better to use GPG or PGP for
</I>&gt;<i> encryption, but C cannot be persuaded to acquire, install and start
</I>&gt;<i> using PGP/GPG and thus keeps ~not~ providing yours truly with her
</I>&gt;<i> public key despite numerous requests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, yours truly thinks it might be more secure than the
</I>&gt;<i> status quo to go straight to an online payment gateway via SSL and
</I>&gt;<i> process the you-know-what in real time. C thinks this is unnecessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your truly thinks it's time to prepare a written form for C to sign,
</I>&gt;<i> wherein she acknowledges having been advised of the risks and
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly states she wants to do it her way anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many TIA,
</I>&gt;<i>
