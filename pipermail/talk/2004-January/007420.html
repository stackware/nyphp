&gt;<i> So it's important to make the session management as strong as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the guys on the team advocates designing the application so it

</I>&gt;<i> the server who the person is and where they are in the application.
</I>
What is this guy's definition of a session? It sounds to me like he simply
advocates passing session data back and forth across the public Internet
rather than keeping it on the server. Which sounds more secure? :-)

&gt;<i> The application when it's deployed will have two or three web servers 
</I>&gt;<i> handling the traffic, with a separate Oracle server. We will have 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple servers for two reasons, first handling the load, and second
</I>&gt;<i> to provide some failover. So whatever mechanism we implement will need
</I>&gt;<i> to scale.
</I>
I hate that word, scale. I think you just mean that the session mechanism
must function correctly in a clustered environment, right?

Keeping session data in a database is a convenient way to achieve this,
although there are other solutions as well. For example, msession is an
extension that was designed specifically to share session data among a
cluster of servers. I've never used it, but it might work well for you
(assuming the database solution doesn't).

Someone at a NYPHP had a pretty creative solution that basically achieved
server affinity at the application level. Maybe they'll speak up and
provide the details, but I remember it had something to do with setting a
cookie that indicated which server had the user's session. As I recall,
this worked well for this developer, and he had some decent traffic to
handle.

&gt;<i> We definitely don't want to make it easy for people to hijack the
</I>&gt;<i> session.
</I>
I wrote an article recently on this that was intended to help get people
started thinking about session security. You can get it for free from:

<A HREF="http://www.phpmag.net/ssl/phppdf/">http://www.phpmag.net/ssl/phppdf/</A>

It's the free sample at the bottom, and the article is, &quot;The Truth about
Sessions.&quot;

&gt;<i> Thoughts, suggestions, or even better what is the &quot;best&quot; way to do
</I>&gt;<i> this?
</I>
What is best for one person isn't necessarily best for another. The
architect of any Web application is likely to be the most qualified person
to be deciding on the best session solution. All you need is a little
background information along with some suggestions and example solutions,
and you're set.

Just don't let anyone who suggests passing session data back and forth
across the Internet for every transaction be making decisions about
session security. :-)

Hope that helps.

Chris

&gt;<i> This one seems to be really catching on.  We are getting a=20

&gt;<i> staring them in the face from their inbox.=20
</I>
I've set Outlook to filter messages with a size of between 29 and 31
kb... works like a charm so far.

But yeah, this one was hitting pretty hard.  The NYPHP lists are getting
slammed, but thankfully they are closed to non members :)
