documentation....
yea, I need to do more of that as well :)

</I>
currently no, the whitelist was a project that I did out of sheer fury.

if you poke around on there and look at the honeymail project, It is
plugin-based and can do reverse checking on the mail and I think I
posted to code to auto-spamcop it.

I probably could hack around in there a bit though. I am waiting for the
go-ahead from work to opensource an ncurses-based mysql
processviewer/graphing program. They are looking into various legal
things that I need to add (disclaimer / limit of liability if it freaks
out and totals some database worth millions.)

I actually had to pull some code on that site that ended up in some work
projects.

oh yea, does anyone on this list know if there are any battle-bot
competitions here in New York city? I want to build a beetle-weight (3
lbs) as it has been a while since I have done any physical engineering
and am kind of wanting to solder together something. Beetle weights are
cheap to make and fight ($500-$800 with very good motors and rc
controller). I think robotcombat.com has some info on some things, but I
have not seen any listings for scheduled battles here in NY.
