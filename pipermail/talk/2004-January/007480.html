I believe it should work the same way, also operating on a copy of the array.

I just dummied up a test and it works this way for me:

class foo {
  var $bar = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
}

$f = new foo;

foreach($f-&gt;bar as $b) {
  print &quot;$b\n&quot;;
  $b++;
}

foreach($f-&gt;bar as $b) {
  print &quot;$b\n&quot;;
}

3
4

By value.

</I>
Pretty much. In a for loop, you can modify the array inside the loop
and the changes will effect the loop. Inside an foreach, you're always
iterating through a copy of the array as it was when you entered the
iterator.

For instance, if you append new elements to $array, and you're looping
until $i &lt; count($array), the loop will take this into account. If you
do that with a foreach, you won't iterate over the appended elements.

&gt;<i> and in both cases, $foo = 'bar' DOES NOT DO $array[$i] = 'bar', yes/no?
</I>
I would think not.

&gt;<i> and foreach(&amp;$array as $foo) should be right out - it's only one value - the
</I>&gt;<i> reference of $array, yes/no?
</I>
I've never tried this, but I'm willing to bet it won't give you a
by-reference iteration.

&gt;<i> I won't argue - this should be intuitive, but as I said, I'm getting
</I>&gt;<i> conflicting output and I am not that good at writing up these questions!! :)
</I>
I try to simplify my code bit by bit until I reach the simplest case
possible that still reproduces the unexpected behavior. Then at least
you can post something understandable to a list for help when you
can't make heads nor tails of it. :)
