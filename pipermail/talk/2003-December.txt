I was wondering how to do this a few days ago. I found this little program called swiftsurf which is a basic http proxy. Its very easy to setup. As long as one does not use add blocking it works fast. One just needs to set  "request 1   answer 1" in the config file to watch all the headers. I like this solution more because it lets me spy on any type of browser i use.

On a related note. I generaly test with Firebird but I took a look at IE and it seems to not want to send If-Modified-Since header even when in cache settings i checked of to check on every page access. Or this could be that IE with wine just dont run right ?

Hi,


I desperately looking for help in Perl cookie handling.

A script reading $ENV{'HTTP_COOKIE'} is working fine when called directly
from a browser (IE6), but
when it is inserted to a HTML page with SSI, $ENV{'HTTP_COOKIE'} is empty
and my authentication fails.

What is the problem?
How can I solve it?

Please CC tip replies to eugenius at freemail.hu.

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <3FCB4DAF.4090709@optonline.net>

I may be faced with a situation where I don't have MCrypt for 
encrypting/decrypting data. I need to store the PIN numbers in a 
database and be able to retrieve them. Is there some other method I can 
use instead? I was thinking, perhaps, something like the following:

$myPinNumber = "123DGH";
$sSecret    = '7R5D1N3V5C4Y6Z2X';
$ary    = array('PIN'    =>    $myPinNumber, 'Secret'    =>    $sSecret);  
$sEncoded    = base64_encode(serialize($ary));

Hi Jeff,

That wouldn't really work. decoding the $sEncoded variable would result in
a serialized array, thus exposing your PIN.

Take a look at Pear's Crypt_Xtea package.
http://pear.php.net/package/Crypt_Xtea

TEA isn't the most trusted algo on the block, but it's probably better 
than obfuscation. If you're really serious about encrypting values, you 
need mcrypt (and some way to keep your encryption key secret).

I do something similar to this when I need to be able to decrypt something.
As long as noone gets a hold of your code to reverse engineer it.

Is $sSecret user provided or are you re-using that for all records?

I usually also append/prepend/insert my own "garbage" strings to the
base64_encode results so that a simple base64_decode doesn't quite
produce the "encrypted" data.
Of course, don't forget to take them out again when you are decrypting.
Also, sometimes I base64_encode the base64_encode result, or three times
even... or four.. ain't I sneaky?
One other thing to do it to get the ord() value for each char before or
after base64-ing it, just to mess things up even more. Use chr() to do
the reverse.

Finally, write the code for this particular piece in the most cryptic
manner that you can and don't comment the code. Don't use easy to follow
var names like "sEncoded"   Use single letters or other nonsense or
random strings for var names, and put in lots of other useless code just
to make it hard to interpret should anyone get a hold of it.

$sSecret would be used for all records.

I'm trying to find out if the client has a particular requirement in 
terms of encrypting since it's sensitive data.

"ain't I sneaky?" - Yes!

This sounds like a recipe for disaster.  If anyone *does* break in to
your server, you'd get toasted this way.

Also, remember: if it's hard for the attacker to interpret, it will be
hard for you to interpret next month.

Now I don't know if this helps, but on my site, users type in their
password, and I compare it with an MD5 sum already in my DB.  If the
sums match, that means that the user typed in the correct password,
and they're authenticated.  This way, no cleartext password gets
stored anywhere.

I didn't claim that this approach would be fool proof, and I did, I
thought, warn against anyone getting a hold of the code as an obvious
security flaw.

Ideally, one wouldn't have to re-interpret the code, but at least you
would know that there's a bunch of crap in there you can ignore.

Comparing an MD5 sum stored in a DB also won't reveal what the
stored/encrypted data is, which I think is what was being sought here.

Let me explain the situation in a bit more detail...this may help to 
clarify what I'm trying to accomplish.

I'll be storing 50,000 PIN numbers for phone cards. People will receive 
a card that has an alphanumeric code. They'll enter the code number into 
a form and receive an email that has a special URL attached. They'll 
click on the URL and then the associated PIN number will be displayed on 
the screen. My intention is to do all of this via SSL.

My concern is the encrypting/decrypting of the PIN numbers. I can't use 
one-way encryption since I need to decrypt the data. The alphanumeric 
codes will also be stored in an encrypted form.

What I meant is, it will be very hard to debug, maintain, and add new
features later, if you obfuscate the code *on purpose*.  Lots of us do
that anyway, by accident.  :)

Yeah, I realized that after reading Jeff's last e-mail.  Jeff, it
sounds like mcrypt is the way to go.  Can it become available to you?
In other words, can you get the site admin to install it?

Yeah, I wrote something like this several years ago called Protoscope
(http://protoscope.org/). I rewrote it in PHP about two years ago to see
how stable the sockets extension was, and it's been stagnating ever since.
:-)

What I liked about mine is that it embeds the HTTP transactions in the
content (in addition to logging it), so the bottom of every page has this.
It's definitely the most convenient one I've used.

What is better about something like the Mozilla plugin is that it can
reveal the HTTP for SSL connections, whereas an HTTP proxy cannot (it has
to just create a tunnel). This makes it much better, in my opinion.

I found out that the site admin can, indeed, install mcrypt...and I 
think that's the best way to go.

while you probably already found a solution for this, the most secure method
will no doubt be using an offline private key for decryption (or hidden
file) ...

there is *suppose* to be a GnuPG extenion library designed to make this
easier: http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/
which would allow for embedding PKI into PHP much easier but I have not seen
or heard any updates to whether this library will be out with PHP 5 (or
compiled for PHP < 5) ... does anyone know?

Answer: In a MySQL table.

When you said you don't have mcrypt
I took that to mean the php is not
compiled without mcrypt.

Can you call the crypto facilities of 
MySQL?

Right. PHP is not compiled with mcrypt.

I'd have to look into your other suggestion to see if it would work on 
the shared server. I wasn't aware of those functions.

Last month's PHundamentals topic, what are the most important php.ini
settings, generated many good suggestions. Now we turn to managing
those settings.

On a server we control, that seems straightforward: we modify php.ini.
But we may also control some PHP settings using a <Directory> or
<Files> directive in httpd.conf, or in .htaccess. What is best
practice here?

And what is best practice on a server we don't control, where we have
access only to our own directories? How can we make certain that our
required settings are in effect?

That's interesting, considering I never spoke to anyone about SuSE,
Novell, Linux on the desktop, or anything relevant to this story.

Thanks for the link. While I don't necessarily disagree with the
statements attributed to me, I certainly don't agree with them all (I'm
not a KDE user, for example), and I am not pleased with having my name
used to support someone else's point. This Jacqueline Emigh lady seems to

Heh, do I want that type of press?

I am going to drop her a note. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and
assume she took crappy notes, but dang, surely the Novell/SuSE stuff was
on a separate page in her notebook than SCO stuff. :-P

It's not those couple of lines that have the effect.  Later in the code $search_id is used in the SQL statement.  In the first case, $search_id is used verbatim; in the later, the return value from intval() is used.  It's nothing concerning intval() or the structure of the if() - just sloppy programming.

Personally, I make extensive use of Apache's directive to control PHP's environment and application behavior.  Properly using these directives, one can realize a great deal of power only thought to exist in those "other platforms."  I especially use the <Directory> and <VirtualHost> directives to manipulate certain areas of my application.

That said, settings that never need to be manipulated, like register_globals :) I set in php.ini.  Other major settings, like output_buffering, or those that can only be set in php.ini, I set in php.ini as well.  I take a hybrid approach to settings like include_path, setting it to different values in different places, but with a sound default in php.ini.

In some cases, you just can't and will have to contact the system administrator.  For that with control, .htaccess can be handy, although access to that file may be limited as well.  In these cases, these settings have to be dealt with using ini_set() in the application's logic.

Determining what settings can be set how and where is vital and explained in http://php.net/ini_set

Setting PHP values in Apache's conf files also have added flexibility.  Setting a value with php_admin_value or php_admin_flag are non-overrideable elsewhere in the application logic, .htaccess files, or even virtual hosts - only Apache's main server config.  More details at http://us3.php.net/configuration.changes

Yeah, someone really needs to write a forum in PHP that doesn't suck.
While they're at it, a CMS that doesn't suck would be nice, too. It's a
shame that there are Perl applications that fit these needs but no decent
PHP representation.

Speaking of "don't need no stinkin' security," here are five more reasons
not to use IE:

I think IE is beating out the Nukes and phpBB as the software with the
worst security model. :-)

Message-ID: <BAY2-DAV34MHi0SYNIP0000090a@hotmail.com>

Okay, here's a really, REALLY basic question. I always seem to
get the high-level stuff and miss the basics (kinda like Algebra
stumps me even with a calculator but Calculus I do in my head :*)

I've RTFM at php.net - very nice docs, like the searchability and
index. Good online reference book. Alas, I want to do my very
first PHP page--well, okay, not the first, I did a "Hello world" and
phpinfo.php and those went fine and told me a bunch about my
installation, all well and interesting, but now I want to do something
I can actually USE.

Let's say I have a page somepage.html and it has an onLoad(params) 
function in the BODY tag that currently calls some JavaScript
funciton. Elsewhere on the page, I have a bunch of links to a PHP version 
of somepage.html and want to pass it different "params" for each of the
links, each of which will "convert" the JavaScript/HTML behavior into 
PHP/HTML behavior and do something different with the onLoad()
depending on which "params" value is clicked by the user.

Never mind if this how to actually do it - I know I should just start
with a php page, but I want to do it this way to LEARN, okay?
If I change too many things at once, I will get lost on what is 
actually happening; my debugging habits are old and fixed. I can
only change one thing at a time or I miss the problem completely.

So for this link, I know I would put "somepage.php?params=value"
cause this is the syntax of a query string and how one passes params
via HTTP, but.... in the somepage.php, what do I do? Where do 
I put the first <?php ... ?> stuff? How do I extract "params" as
a variable and get its user-selected value? 

The documentation seems to imply I would just put:

<?php
$params=value;
...
?>

and that the query string will have "created" the variable $params
and somehow PHP will "know" what's in the query string and
"value" will be defined...really? I don't have to extract some 
ENV-VAR like old-fashioned CGI processing?

And since the assignment I want to do is in the BODY tag, how
do I write the body tag with a PHP variable? like this:

<?php
$params=value;
echo "<BODY onLoad=\"myJavaScriptFunc(\" + $params + \");\" ";
?>

That didn't seem to do it for me so I must have misread or
misunderstood the docs. Enlighten my ignorant self, someone?

Sarah,

"So for this link, I know I would put "somepage.php?params=value"
cause this is the syntax of a query string and how one passes params
via HTTP, but.... in the somepage.php, what do I do? Where do

a variable and get its user-selected value?

The documentation seems to imply I would just put:

<?php
$params=value;
...
?>"

Here's the basics:
	You've got "somepage.php?params=value". To grab that value you could 
use something like the following on somepage.php:
	$sMyValue = $_GET['params'];
You could put this at/near the top of the page within the php tags 
since, I assume, the remainder of the page is based on the user's selection.

You'll want to use some sort of test to make sure that the value of 
$_GET['params'] is a legitimate value since a user can muck around with 
a value that is appended to a URL. So...if you used a switch statement, 
(http://us4.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php) you could 
have a default value to handle the case where the user has played around.

Don't forget that PHP is server-side and Javascript is client-side. I 
believe some others on the list can address the issue of having the two 
communicate...in a sense.

Please keep in mind, having been burnt badly by this, that some users 
will intentionally turn off Javascript "just to see what happens" so 
that, depending on what you're trying to do with the Javascript, it can 
really create a mess.

there's a lot going on here, but let's start with the body 
tag syntax example:

<body <?php if (isset($onload)) echo $onload; ?>>

the above is php embedded in an html tag rather than html 
being "embedded" (echo) in a php statement


so far as your debugging style, it seems to me that it is 
right on... I've always found that changing more than one 
variable at a time sometimes masks valuable information that 
could be gleaned with just a little more patience.

try putting a value in the $onload variable and observe 
results -- oftentimes that will lead to your next question 
along the discovery process

hope that helps a little

I think the interesting thing is that these types of applications do exist in PHP.  In passing, I've seen some excellent software, written in house, and kept private.  It's really a matter of public domain stuff, and a sense of a strong - public - community.  PHP vs Perl is akin to BSD vs Linux - we all know which one is better, but the BSD guys just don't care to talk about it so much :)

In the end, this is what NYPHP - and now NYCBUG - seek to promote - community.

I'm going to skip straight to the php.

With this code, you are initializing $params as a variable with value.
> <?php
> $params=value;
> ...

However you are passing ?params=value in the query string. You can
access the query string variable directly as $_GET['params'].

This only happens if register_globals is turned on in your php_ini.
Don't rely on it. Do it the right way with $_GET['params'].

Change this:
> <?php
> $params=value;
> echo "<BODY onLoad=\"myJavaScriptFunc(\" + $params + \");\" ";
> ?>

to:
<BODY onload="myJavaScriptFunc(<?=$_GET['params']?>)">

It's MUCH easier to drop PHP vars into html this way, rather than
echoing out the full line with escaped quotes, etc.

I have been meaning to take a look at the following:
http://www.yabbse.org/

It is a php conversion of YABB at
http://www.yabbforum.com/

YABB was done in Perl and is highly
touted (at least at Tucows)

YABBSE was done in PHP.

What caught my eye was the following quote from 
the yabbse.org page:
"I checked my bandwidth with YaBB SE and its over 2 days 338 mb. When I
had YaBB gold it was close to a GIG a day"

If the guy who said that is really on the level (I don't doubt his 
honesty but there may have been fewer users doing fewer things)
that would mean PHP is approaching six times more efficient than
Perl.

I wish I could find time to check the two implementations to
see where PHP is more efficient than Perl.

That sounds interesting. I might go check out a demo.

To be fair, FUDforum is pretty good. My complaints with it are:

1. Too complicated to use (maybe partly because of point 2)
2. Fugly! They need someone like Jeff Knight to completely redo the entire
presentation layer.

Underneath, it's really not so bad, and it's insanely fast.

I don't think he means more efficient. Bandwidth usage like that only
suggests that YaBB SE spits out less markup. That's a good thing, but it
could (theoretically) take twice as long to do so. :-)

FUDforum has a very interesting feature for meshing with mailing list programs, like Mailman. I agree it's pretty ugly.

I mean more efficient -- if you can get the same content
out with less markup how else do you describe it 
(other than being more efficient)

with 3.0 beta, uses better password encryption than just plain md5. its not

You're both right!

Getting the same content with less markup is more bandwidth efficient,
but if it requires twice as many CPU cycles to generate the output
then there may also be a decrease in processing efficiency.

Chris's point was that you can't measure the net efficiency of the
system by only looking at one source.

Maybe it's just a difference of interpretation, but let's take some
clearer examples:

foo.php:
<?
sleep(5);
echo 'foo';
?>

bar.php:
<?
sleep(1);
echo 'barbarbarbarbar';
?>

I would say that bar.php is more efficient, but foo.php produces less
markup.

Hi there

can someone tell me why this query below is not working in mysql 4.0.16 
its a select within a select query. If this syntax below is not correct, is
there a work around for this.

Considering tblA has alot of fields including ID(Primary Key) and ID1 as
another field

Query:
Select * from tblA where id in (select max(id) from tblA where id>=76 and
id<=109 group by id1)

That's a good point. I guess I always think of "efficient" referring to
performance (processing performance, to be specific).

Not to nit-pick, but why would bar.php be more efficient?  foo.php is sleeping, thus taking no CPU cycles.  Maybe if foo.php was for( $i = 0; $i < 1000000000; ++$i );  echo 'foo';  ?   :)

Keep in mind that PHP runs strictly on the server - the browser is never aware of any PHP code.  Granted, you can use PHP to generate the client-side code the browser then reads and parses, but translating between Javascript and PHP - in a linear sense - is not possible.

I was under the impression that you could in the where clause, although I'm
not sure if you can use it with an 'in' statement.  I know you can't use it
in the SELECT part of a statement (as a field), though.

In the manual
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Subqueries.html

And a tutorial

It's all a question of how you define efficient in regards to serving web
pages.
Some people might says it's much resources you use.
Some people might say it's how long it takes to serve a web page.

In my book, it's all about how many web pages per second I can serve AND how
long it takes to serve a page.
If solution A has better numbers for both criteria than solution B, then I'd
say it's more efficient.
If solution A has better numbers than solution B for one of the criteria but
worse numbers for the other criteria, then it's really a question of what's
important to you.

That's why, after a fair amount of poking around, I've decided to go with
Moveable Type (http://moveabletype.org/) as my blogware with which to join
this latest craze in narcissism and self-indulgence. I found it
encouraging to read that it requires a whole slew of well-exercised,
mature CPAN modules. To me that means the developers are not reinventing
the proverbial wheel and compromising security, reliability, etc., in the
process.

(Oh yeah, I also used a little ad hominem non-reasoning: that Jeremy
Zawodny dude, who seems to know a lot of stuff judging from his writings,
really likes PHP, yet he uses MT.)

In-Reply-To: <Pine.BSF.4.44.0312021445460.53965-100000@emra.pair.com>
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.44.0312021505260.53965-100000@emra.pair.com>


I've been studying the recipe in the Cookbook, which is the closest thing
to documentation that I've been able to find for DB_Cache, other than in
the source.

So here's what I don't understand. Say you're using the 'file' container
-- a disk-based cache. When you call the constructor like so

$db = new Cache_DB('file',array('cache_dir'=>'/my/cache_dir/'),86400);


you're telling it where to cache data. Fine. Then you do a query -- call
it query_1. Suppose in the course of the same script you want to cache the
results of another query_2. Further suppose that at some point you want to
be able to flush() the cached results of query_1, but not query_2. If you
just say flush('db_cache') then you flush the cached results of ~both~
queries.

Are we supposed to set cache_dir to different values for each query before
querying and/or calling flush? I haven't found any setter method for doing
that, and although I realize that in PHP 4 you can can access object
variables directly, I wonder if code written that way might break in PHP
5.

I guess you could also create a new Cache_DB instance with different
arguments for each query, but that seems wasteful.

I hope this is coherent -- if I sound confused it's because I am confused.
The more general problem is that my application relies on some MySQL
tables that get updated many times a day, and some tables that get updated
a few times a year. Hence my interest in DB_Cache.

Many TIA,

I've often found that PHP Cookbook is the only documention for PEAR
packages. Of course, it means when people ask me questions about the
recipes, I'm forced to re-read to source to rememeber why I wrote what
I did. Even worse, Dave wrote that recipe. :)

Right. I believe the assumption is that you want to flush the cache
when you update your data and that all datasets have similar update windows.

Can't you set up two caches? One for the frequently updated data and
one for the few times a year updated data? Or only cache the few times
a year data and don't bother caching the frequently updated data at
all?

Ha! Speaking of which, in case you're considering coming out with another
edition someday, a suggestion/question:  wouldn't you want to use
$db->setConnection($dsn) in this recipe, which "[registers] a database
connection for connect on demand"? I can't understand why anyone would
want to use the unconditional connect() when they're only planning to
SELECT, if the whole point is to save db overhead. (Then again I've hardly
mastered the internals ergo don't know what I'm talking about (-: )

Yes, certainly. I plan not to cache the frequently-updated at all, and
cache the quasi-static, but I guess I was trying to tune the caching more
finely than this class thinks I need to. So it seems the answer is, blow
away the whole cache when you flush(), and don't worry about it, you're
still realizing big big savings.

Thanks again Adam. Love that book! Now back to the kitchen.

Thanks for the tip. I will add this to this giant TODO list for the
Second Edition.

FWIW, here are the most likely answers to any similar questions:

1) That feature wasn't available when we wrote the book.
2) We weren't smart enough to realize that feature was available when
we wrote the book.

Usually, if we saw something you shouldn't do, we mentioned it. If a
feature is omitted, and it seems smart to use it, you probably
should. :)

I guess my subject line wording is a bit misleading. I don't
mean a LITERAL translation. I meant to say I am trying
to translate my thinking into how to design the same
results/behavior with a different approach, a PHP approach.
There is always more than one way to skin any cat and I
am not used to thinking in PHP terms--as is apparent from
my newbie post where I was embedding HTML in PHP
rather than PHP into HTML which seems obvious now
that some of you have pointed it out to me :-) Thanks for 
the tips, guys.

I'm asking for more "tips" like this, how to approach, in
PHP, doing things like overwriting DIVs to dynamically
load content or how to replace stylesheets based on
user prefs using PHP rather than JS...such as the JS
code described at:

http://www.alistapart.com/articles/alternate/

Maybe some of these behaviors are simply not appropriate 
for a PHP implementation - I dunno - that's why I'm asking 
for your opinions :)

Maybe it'd better to ask, how would I go about "retooling" 
existing functionality from JS to PHP? Assuming the 
functionality is *not* specifically better-suited for a client-side 
scripting. Better way to ask? :)

Message-ID: <4A34D0947B38AF4D8629DA86655D5906C2A2@ffth-exc01.thompsonhealth.org>

In my opinion, to accomplish that I would probabally use sessions, or a get
variable.

in the top, you would have something like this:

<?php

$current_stylesheet = "default.css";

if (!empty($_GET['stylesheet']))
{
  switch($_GET['stylesheet'])
  {
    case "red":
      $current_stylesheet = "red.css";
      break;
    case "blue":
      $current_stylesheet = "blue.css";
      break;
  }
}
?>
Then where you display the style sheet, you would do something like this in
the html code:

<link rel="stylesheet"
type="text/css" href="<?php print($current_stylesheet); ?>" />


So when you have a list of stylesheets to use, it just reloads the page, say
index.php, as index.php?stylesheet=red - and it will load the red style
sheet. If they did not enter a style sheet, or it is not one of your
options, then it would load the default style sheet.

the thing with this one, is that you have to pass the get variable to each
page that you want to have customized style sheets, which can be a lot of
reworking, because you have to add something like this to each link:
<A href="links.php<?php if ($current_stylesheet != "default.css") {
print("?stylesheet=".$_GET['stylesheet']); } ?>">Links</a>

This prints out the ?stylesheet=red (as an example) after the link, if red
is selected. if there is no option, it wont print anything after the link.

The other way to do it is with sessions, which for me is easier.

on the top of the page, do something like
<?php
  session_name("mysite.com_css");
  session_start();

  if (empty($_SESSION['stylesheet']))
    $_SESSION['stylesheet'] = "default.css";

  if (!empty($_GET['stylesheet']))
  {
    switch($_GET['stylesheet'])
    {
      case "red":
        $_SESSION['stylesheet'] = "red.css";
        break;
      case "blue":
        $_SESSION['stylesheet'] = "blue.css";
        break;
    }
  }

?>

Then where you display the style sheet, you would do something like this in
the html code:

<link rel="stylesheet"
type="text/css" href="<?php print($_SESSION['stylesheet']); ?>" />

This way, you can change the stylesheet with the GET request, say
page.php?stylesheet=red - and it will change the stylesheet in the users
session. Since the sessions are saved for the browser session, it will keep
the session variables for each page that the user loads, and thus keeping
their selected style with each page, without having to add any more get
requests.

If it were me, I would add the php code that checks the session
variables/get variables in an include file, say change_css.php - and include
it on the top of every file, or in your header file. This way its easier to
add another option for a different CSS.

Wow, Keith, thanks for the lesson!! This is *EXACTLY*
what I wanted - a comparison of approaches and the PHP
solution to a parallel JS situation.  And I agree, sessions are
much easier to manage for anything that forces a reload of
a page otherwise. Will be studying this and probably trying
something out with it this weekend. Stay tuned... :)

Thanks to Jeff, John and Brian for the getting
me started tutorials here - and for straightening
me out on what to embed in what ;-) Yes, I am
dyslexic but I think it's more than I'm not used
to thinking in terms of a parsed language, having
not used Perl for more than 4 or 5 years. Gotta
get my brain back into it.

Thanks again for all your help guys!!

"Well-designed" and "secure" mean different things to different folks, 
but classes generic enough to be used as lego blocks have a hard time 
earning those descriptions.

Guilty (again) of being sloppy and inexact.

What I meant to say is doesn't the PFC at PEAR 
aim at this goal?

And to what degree do people think the PEAR Foundation
Classes have achieved that goal.

Hey! Now don't go comparing apples to oranges--wwwac is still

We have lots of fun over there and occasionally get some work
done, too!  For the focused topic of PHP or PHP/mySQL, yes,
this is HEAVEN :-) So glad I found you guys.

Jeff, thanks for the list of books - I have no money for any books
right now but the Great American Public Library system seems to
keep themselves pretty well-stocked on computer-related things 
here in Cambridge. Big surprise, huh? <<g>> 

I'll see what I can find. I think O'Reilly needs to have a "large 
consumer's club" or "Book of the Month" club  where if you buy 
at least 8 books a year, you get one free or something :-D  The 
only things besides clothes that I have paid to ship internationally 
(no less than 3 times) are my computer and engineering 
books--more than half of them ORA. I want something back, 
darnit.

nope, was more of a comment about the stuff out there of 
questionable quality from a security standpoint

In fact, I use PEAR when I'm teaching noobie PHP 
fundamentals to give the people a standard for coding after 
we've thrown something together that "works"

moo,

Web references are the best, but when trying to learn, sometimes it can be
better to just have a book. Can't connect in the subway ya know, and that's
my favorite place to read. I sometimes hop on the 1/9 and ride it till I get
back to where I start. FREAK

I have known the feeling of not having money for books, and it being the
season for giving, I have a few books you might like and I don't need. If
you don't mind traveling for them, they're yours.

You are right - and that is crazy!!!

Hey folks,

Ok, guys, I know I've seen this time in again across the web, but now I
actually have a need (doing a presentation for a course I am taking, and I
bet I can use this content for a future LIPHP meeting) for this type of
info.  Stats on speed, performance, easy of use, features, support etc.

I will do my share of googling for this info, I promise, but I figured
someone out there may have some good links right at there fingertips which
is why I am asking first.

And hey, I bet many of us on the list would enjoy a good discussion about
this type of thing.  Nowhere did I mention that my presentation had to be
objective. Just kidding. :-)

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Just to round things out, there is the article that used to be on the 
Microsoft site that compared ASP.net to PHP. It's always good to know 
what the other side thinks.

See: http://www.msdnaa.net/Resources/display.aspx?ResID=2315

This used to be on the MSDN site but seems to have been removed and 
placed on the site noted above.

Hi there.

I develop sites with my own custom publishing engine that I've been 
adding to since about 1998...all in PHP.  My goals are to keep it as 
modular as possible, so I can easily plug in different bits of 
functionality, and provide my clients with the greatest amount of 
flexibility in terms of what it can be used for.

So, with that mindset, I'm interested in how people here have 
approached multilingual sites in a PHP/MySQL environment?  In 
particular, I have an upcoming cultural project that will be 
translated into an unknown number of languages, and only in bits and 
pieces.  So, at any given point in the content hierarchy, the system 
will need to look for a preferred language, and if it isn't found, go 
to the next on the list, and so on.

(This is similar to the way Mac OS X works if any of you have used it.)

The content will vary in terms of scope, length and type; right now, 
I tend to utilize MySQL for text data storage about 80% of the time, 
and the other 20% of the time I store textual content in text files, 
as serialized PHP objects.  I always store graphics in the filesystem.

So, I have my own ideas on how I am going to approach this, but here 
are my questions.

How do you handle multilingual sites?  Do you tend to store data in 
text files, in a database, or some other way?  Do you maintain 
different entire databases for each language, or different tables in 
the same database, or just different columns in the same table(s)?

Looking for abstract answers here about strategy.

Thanks much,

I'm currently a fan of creating records in a separate table, one for 
each translation of a document. The translations table is keyed on the 
document id and language code so there can't be multiple same-language 
translations of something.

On lookup, if the user's language is different from the document's 
language, some logic handles the lookup and, if a record is found, the 
original content is replaced with the translated content.

One suggestion: consider using valid locales as your language codes so 
that you can use them with strftime() to format dates. Just using "en" 
or "es" might not be enough depending on your OS.

Some of the techniques I used to use are documented here:

http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2002/11/28/php_i18n.html

I don't think this meshes well with your setup, but I pass it along anyway.

You should definitely use locales. People are really picky about
this.

I would also suggest that you look into the GNU gettext library. You
can build it as a PHP extension and I would guess that gettext is very
efficient, if this is major concern to you.

It also allows you to handle all sorts of pluralization and other
oddities without needing to write your own.

Hi,

We have been providing multilingual support for websites since 4 years. To
store language variables we use File system instead of DB, as DB access for
each and every page is not recommended from performance point of view in
general sense. Just think how many DB interactions you will need for each
and every request if you store language variables in DB.

We don't do embedded programming, rather we keep pur PHP code and GUI part
separately, hence we store all language variables in 1 php file depnding
upon how much language support u require. While displaying those language
specific items, we store language variable in session variable or in cookie
at client side and use it across our all php files. Whenever new language is
selected (by flag or caption name) 1,2 or 3 or 4 will be stored in session
which will determine which language file is to be included. My structure is
like below.

....Config variables or Config files

....Language files say 1.inc or 2.inc (1 and 2 are stored in session)

....Other files or Main code

....Parse your language variables here

....Print out put to browser

For exmaple your 1.inc file (which is in english) contains variables like
below

$cap[hello]="Hello";
$msg[hello]="Welcome to Foo site";

And 2.inc (which is in spanish langauge) contains variables like below

$cap[hello]="Hola";
$msg[hello]="Welcome ... .. site";

And similarly 3.inc, 4.inc etc.. While GUI part your html files contains
variables like this

{WELCOME}
{WELCOME_MSG}

Finally 1 of your common parsing file, like ** rFastTemplate.php** in our
case using "assign" method, will parse php realted variables into html
template and will send output to browser. code can be like below:

[.....code.....includable files..code...]

$tp->assign(array(WELCOME=>$cap[hello],WELCOME_MSG=>$msg[hello]));

[...print output...]

By this way effieceint multilingual implementation can be achieved without
any extra efforts. Maximum benefit is that we don't require DB connections
here, as this system is absolutely dependent upon File system.

There's already a PHP Cruise.  I think a PHP Ski Trip with tutorials, sessions, powder and hot chocolate would be great :)

You should also check out the NYFE (New York Front End) list, also at http://nyphp.org/lists

It focuses on client-side coding and interaction between PHP and client side languages - crazy guys, but they're great  :)

NYPHP's book review program might help.  We've got a couple great books left and request more from the publishers.  The books are free, but we ask that you write a short review of the book.  See http://nyphp.org/library for more.

I would say PEAR doesn't do this for a number of reasons.  For one, PEAR is not modular (component) based.  It's a framework with a great deal of interdependancy that provides a large and varied set of functionality.  PEAR doesn't provide isolated functionality - it's all PEAR or nothing.  More of an erector set than legos? :)

PCOMs, or any component based system, are isolated from each other.  There are no dependancies between components, and each provides a very specific set of functionality - yet, the functionality is generic (could be used and reused in any environment).

Personally, and not to come down on PEAR or CPAN too much, but a large, complex and interconnected framework is more prone to security issues, not to mention performance and maintainability.  A component model allows specific functionality to be extremely well tested, maintained and deployed.

My 2 cents,

H

Is it fair to characterize your response as:

1) Not modular (too interconnected)
2) Complex (large) making it:
   2a) hard to maintain
   2b) slow
   2c) prone to security flaws

Subject: MySQL 4.1.1 has been released
Date: Thu, 4 Dec 2003 16:23:56 +0100 (CET)
From: Lenz Grimmer <lenz at mysql.com>
To: announce at lists.mysql.com

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

MySQL 4.1.1, a new version of the popular Open Source/Free Software
database management system, has been released. It is now available in
source and binary form for a number of platforms from our download pages
at http://www.mysql.com/downloads/ and mirror sites.

Note that not all mirror sites may be up to date at this point in time -
if you can't find this version on some mirror, please try again later or
choose another download site.

This is the second Alpha development release of the 4.1 tree, adding many
new features (see below) and fixing recently discovered bugs. Please refer
to our bug database at http://bugs.mysql.com/ for more details about the
individual bugs fixed in this version.

As this code is currently labeled "Alpha", we do not recommend that this
version be used in production environments yet!

However, we encourage you to test and evaluate it and, more importantly,
report any bugs or observations to our bug tracking database at
http://bugs.mysql.com/.

Please note, that for us to resolve a bug report, a reproducible test is
required. See "How to report a bug" at
http://bugs.mysql.com/how-to-report.php for more details before filing a
bug report. We appreciate your support!

For a more detailed list of features in MySQL 4.1, please see
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/MySQL_4.1_Nutshell.html

News from the ChangeLog:

Functionality added or changed:

   * Added `IGNORE' option for `DELETE' statement.

   * The MySQL source distribution now also includes the MySQL Internals
     Manual `internals.texi'.

   * Added `mysql_set_server_option()' C API client function to allow
     multiple statement handling in the server to be enabled or
     disabled.

   * The `mysql_next_result()' C API function now returns `-1' if there
     are no more result sets.

   * Renamed `CLIENT_MULTI_QUERIES' connect option flag to
     `CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS'. To allow for a transition period, the
     old option will continue to be recognized for a while.

   * Require `DEFAULT' before table and database default character set.
     This enables us to use `ALTER TABLE table_name ... CHARACTER
     SET=...' to change the character set for all `CHAR', `VARCHAR', and
     `TEXT' columns in a table.

   * Added `MATCH ... AGAINST( ... WITH QUERY EXPANSION)' and the
     `ft_query_expansion_limit' server variable.

   * Removed unused `ft_max_word_len_for_sort' server variable.

   * Full-text search now supports multi-byte character sets and the
     Unicode `utf8' character set. (The Unicode `ucs2' character set is
     not yet supported.)

   * Phrase search in `MATCH ... AGAINST ( ... IN BOOLEAN MODE)' no
     longer matches partial words.

   * Added aggregate function `BIT_XOR()' for bitwise XOR operations.

   * Replication over SSL now works.

   * The `START SLAVE' statement now supports an `UNTIL' clause for
     specifying that the slave SQL thread should be started but run
     only until it reaches a given position in the master's binary logs
     or in the slave's relay logs.

   * Produce warnings even for single-row `INSERT' statements, not just
     for multiple-row `INSERT' statements. Previously, it was necessary
     to set `SQL_WARNINGS=1' to generate warnings for single-row
     statements.

   * Added `delimiter' (`\d') command to the `mysql' command-line
     client for changing the statement delimiter (terminator).  The
     default delimiter is semicolon.

   * `CHAR', `VARCHAR', and `TEXT' columns now have lengths measured in
     characters rather than in bytes.  The character size depends on
     the column's character set.  This means, for example, that a
     `CHAR(n)' column for a multi-byte character set will take more
     storage than before.  Similarly, index values on such columns are
     measured in characters, not bytes.

   * The `DATABASE()' function now returns `NULL' rather than the empty
     string if there is no database selected.

   * Added `--sql-mode=NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO' option to suppress the
     usual behaviour of generating the next sequence number when zero
     is stored in an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column. With this mode enabled,
     zero is stored as zero; only storing `NULL' generates a sequence
     number.

   * *Warning: Incompatible change!* Client authentication now is based
     on 41-byte passwords in the `user' table, not 45-byte passwords as
     in 4.1.0.  Any 45-byte passwords created for 4.1.0 must be reset
     after running the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script.

   * *Warning: Incompatible change!* Renamed the C API
     `mysql_prepare_result()' function to `mysql_get_metadata()' as the
     old name was confusing.

   * Added `DROP USER 'username'@'hostname'' statement to drop an
     account that has no privileges.

   * The interface to aggregated UDF functions has changed a bit. You
     must now declare a `xxx_clear()' function for each aggregate
     function `XXX()'.

   * The `CONCAT_WS()' function no longer skips empty strings.

   * Added new `ADDTIME()', `DATE()', `DATEDIFF()', `LAST_DAY()',
     `MAKEDATE()', `MAKETIME()', `MICROSECOND()', `SUBTIME()',
     `TIME()', `TIMEDIFF()', `TIMESTAMP()', `UTC_DATE()', `UTC_TIME()',
     `UTC_TIMESTAMP()', and `WEEKOFYEAR()' functions.

   * Added new syntax for `ADDDATE()' and `SUBDATE()'.  The second
     argument now may be a number representing the number of days to be
     added to or subtracted from the first date argument.

   * Added new `type' values `DAY_MICROSECOND', `HOUR_MICROSECOND',
     `MINUTE_MICROSECOND', `SECOND_MICROSECOND', and `MICROSECOND' for
     `DATE_ADD()', `DATE_SUB()', and `EXTRACT()'.

   * Added new `%f' microseconds format specifier for `DATE_FORMAT()'
     and `TIME_FORMAT()'.

   * All queries in which at least one `SELECT' does not use indexes
     properly now are written to the slow query log when long log
     format is used.

   * It is now possible to create a `MERGE' table from `MyISAM' tables
     in different databases. Formerly, all the `MyISAM' tables had to
     be in the same database, and the `MERGE' table had to be created
     in that database as well.

   * Added new `COMPRESS()', `UNCOMPRESS()', and
     `UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH()' functions.

   * When doing `SET sql_mode='mode'' for a complex mode (like `ANSI'),
     we now update the `sql_mode' variable to include all the
     individual options implied by the complex mode.

   * Added the OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) function `ROLLUP',
     which provides summary rows for each `GROUP BY' level.

   * Added `SQLSTATE' codes for all server errors.

   * Added `mysql_sqlstate()' and `mysql_stmt_sqlstate()' C API client
     functions that return the `SQLSTATE' error code for the last error.

   * `TIME' columns with hour values greater than 24 were returned
     incorrectly to the client.

   * `ANALYZE', `OPTIMIZE', `REPAIR', and `FLUSH' statements are now
     stored in the binary log and thus replicated to slaves.  This
     logging does not occur if the optional `NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG' keyword
     (or its alias `LOCAL') is given.  Exceptions are that `FLUSH
     LOGS', `FLUSH MASTER', `FLUSH SLAVE', and `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
     LOCK' are not logged in any case.  For a syntax example, see *Note
     `FLUSH': FLUSH.

   * New global variable `RELAY_LOG_PURGE' to enable or disable
     automatic relay log purging.

   * `LOAD DATA' now produces warnings that can be fetched with `SHOW
     WARNINGS'.

   * Added support for syntax `CREATE TABLE table2 (LIKE table1)' that
     creates an empty table `table2' with a definition that is exactly
     the same as `table1', including any indexes.

   * `CREATE TABLE table_name (...) TYPE=storage_engine' now generates a
     warning if the named storage engine is not available. The table is
     still created as a `MyISAM' table, as before.

   * Most subqueries are now much faster than before.

   * Added `PURGE BINARY LOGS' as an alias for `PURGE MASTER LOGS'.

   * Disabled the `PURGE LOGS' statement that was added in in version
     4.1.0.  The statement now should be issued as `PURGE MASTER LOGS'
     or `PURGE BINARY LOGS'.

   * Added `SHOW BDB LOGS' as an alias for `SHOW LOGS'.

   * Added `SHOW MASTER LOGS' (which had been deleted in version 4.1.0)
     as an alias for `SHOW BINARY LOGS'.

   * Added `Slave_IO_State' and `Seconds_Behind_Master' columns to the
     output of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS'.  `Slave_IO_State' indicates the
     state of the slave I/O thread, and `Seconds_Behind_Master'
     indicates the number of seconds by which the slave is late
     compared to the master.

   * `--lower-case-table-names=1' now also makes aliases case
     insensitive. (Bug #534)


Bugs fixed:

   * Fixed a bug in privilege handling that caused connections from
     certain IP addresses to be assigned incorrect database-level
     privileges.  A connection could be assigned the database
     privileges of the previous successful authentication from one of
     those IP addresses, even if the IP address username and database
     name were different. (Bug #1636)

   * Error-handling functions were not called properly when an error
     resulted from `[CREATE | REPLACE| INSERT] ... SELECT' statements.

   * `HASH', `BTREE', `RTREE', `ERRORS', and `WARNINGS' no longer are
     reserved words. (Bug #724)

   * Fix for bug in `ROLLUP' when all tables were `const' tables.  (Bug
     #714)

   * Fixed a bug in `UNION' that prohibited `NULL' values from being
     inserted into result set columns where the first `SELECT' of the
     `UNION' retrieved `NOT NULL' columns.

   * Fixed name resolution of columns of reduced subqueries in unions.
     (Bug #745)

   * Fixed memory overrun in subqueries in select list with `WHERE'
     clause bigger than outer query `WHERE' clause. (Bug #726)

   * Fixed a bug that caused `MyISAM' tables with `FULLTEXT' indexes
     created in 4.0.x to be unreadable in 4.1.x.

   * Fixed a data loss bug in `REPAIR TABLE ... USE_FRM' when used with
     tables that contained `TIMESTAMP' columns and were created in
     4.0.x.

   * Fixed reduced subquery processing in `ORDER BY'/`GROUP BY'
     clauses. (Bug #442)

   * Fixed name resolution of outer columns of subquery in
     `INSERT'/`REPLACE' statements. (Bug #446)

   * Fixed bug in marking columns of reduced subqueries. (Bug #679)

   * Fixed a bug that made `CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX' syntax illegal.

   * Fixed a crash when a `SELECT' that required a temporary table
     (marked by `Using temporary' in `EXPLAIN' output) was used as a
     derived table in `EXPLAIN' command. (Bug #251)

   * Fixed a rare table corruption bug in `DELETE' from a big table with
     a *new* (created by MySQL-4.1) full-text index.

   * `LAST_INSERT_ID()' now returns 0 if the last `INSERT' statement
     didn't insert any rows.

   * Fixed missing last character in function output. (Bug #447)

   * Fixed a rare replication bug when a transaction spanned two or more
     relay logs, and the slave was stopped while executing the part of
     the transaction that was in the second or later relay log. Then
     replication would resume at the beginning of the second or later
     relay log, which was incorrect. (It should resume at `BEGIN', in
     the first relay log.) (Bug #53)

   * `CONNECTION_ID()' now is properly replicated. (Bug #177)

   * The new `PASSWORD()' function in 4.1 is now properly replicated.
     (Bug #344)

   * Fixed bug with doubly freed memory.

   * Fixed crashing bug in `UNION' operations that involved temporary
     tables.

   * Fixed a crashing bug in `DERIVED TABLES' when `EXPLAIN' is used on
     a `DERIVED TABLES' with a join.

   * Fixed a crashing bug in `DELETE' with `ORDER BY' and `LIMIT'
     caused by an uninitialized array of reference pointers.

   * Fixed a bug in the `USER()' function caused by an error in the
     size of the allocated string.

   * Fixed a crashing bug when attempting to create a table containing
     a spatial (GIS) column with a storage engine that does not support
     spatial types.

   * Fixed a crashing bug in `UNION' caused by the empty select list and
     a non-existent column being used in some of the individual `SELECT'
     statements.

   * Fixed a replication bug with a 3.23 master and a 4.0 slave: The
     slave lost the replicated temporary tables if `FLUSH LOGS' was
     issued on the master. (Bug #254)

   * Fixed a security bug: A server compiled without SSL support still
     allowed connections by users that had the `REQUIRE SSL' option
     specified for their accounts.

   * When an undefined user variable was used in a updating query on the
     master (such as `INSERT INTO t VALUES(@a)', where `@a' had never
     been set by this connection before), the slave could replicate the
     query incorrectly if a previous transaction on the master used a
     user variable of the same name. (Bug #1331)

   * Fixed bug with prepared statements: Using the `?' prepared
     statement parameter as the argument to certain functions or
     statement clauses caused a server crash when `mysql_prepare()' was
     invoked. (Bug #1500)

Additional notes:

   * Due to a bug in the getpeername() system call on 64bit HP-UX, we
     currently do not provide 64bit binaries for HP-UX (IA64 and PA-RISC).
     We are working closely with HP on investigating this issue.

Yes, albeit taken out of context it sounds very harsh :)

In all, I feel that these points hold true in any environment, PHP/PEAR or not.

Creating our own feed would be easier than it was to create the aggregator.
And we can reuse much of the same code that we currently use for "Hot
Threads" on the left nav.

I actually threw together an RSS 2.0 feed last night for one of my own
sites in less than 20 minutes - right after discovering the coolness that
is FeedDemon (from the guy that wrote HomeSite and currently develops
TopStyle) http://bradsoft.com/feeddemon/

I say we tack it on to next week's development meeting agenda.

Hi there

Can someone tell me how to do case insensitive string comparison in smarty
templates.
and also how to trim strings while comparing them.

For e.g.
{if $var == "Var"} Display {/if} 
if this is the statement how to I change it so that it trims $var and does a
case insensitive compare with "Var"

Does something like this work?

{if $var|lower == "var"} Display {/if}

You would need to change the case of the string, say strtolower($var) ==
"var"

if you want to compare a substring, use the function substr ($var, $start,
$end)

so if you wanted to compare the first 3 characters of $var to see if they
matched var, you would do

if (strtolower(substr($var,0,3)) == "var")
{
  dosomething;
}

Thanks,
This worked for me

trim(strtolower($var) == "var"

Would the strtolower function work inside a smarty template?

You would need to change the case of the string, say strtolower($var) ==
"var"

if you want to compare a substring, use the function substr ($var, $start,
$end)

so if you wanted to compare the first 3 characters of $var to see if they
matched var, you would do

if (strtolower(substr($var,0,3)) == "var")
{
  dosomething;
}

Hi there

Can someone tell me how to do case insensitive string comparison in smarty
templates.
and also how to trim strings while comparing them.

For e.g.
{if $var == "Var"} Display {/if}
if this is the statement how to I change it so that it trims $var and does a
case insensitive compare with "Var"

What does anyone else think of PEAR? Here I was believing the hype about
the great quality... and increasingly, using PEAR. Just now I've been
playing with the Auth package and it certainly is not hard to set up.
ergo, from my point of view, not inordinately complex.

I assume you Cookbook guys have nothing against PEAR, n'est-ce pas?

Yes, vBulletin does looks pretty good. And I 
think it was under consideration for NYPHP.

I am not sure why it wasn't chosen.
(I do recall Hans saying something
like buying a license for something 
was definitely an option -- so price 
was not an issue)
The  impression I got was that some
members already were experienced with
Invision -- so we went with that.

Anyway the present forum (Invision) is a short term 
solution -- the long term solution is going to be
to build as Chris Shiflett put it earlier
('twas oft thought but ne're so well expressed)
"...a forum in PHP that doesn't suck."

Maybe you could start a topic in the NYPHP 
forums describing vBulletins best features.
In it you could ask for opinions about which 
features people think would be of most value 
for the new forum which is in the works.

I believe it was mentioned that the main reason for picking IPB was that it
is "opensource". I can't recall where it was said, but am pretty sure that I
can find the message :-)

I am not too experienced with forums as far as aministrating them and such. I noticed forums with large numbers of posts choose vBulletin. For example sitepointforums.com has over a million posts and straightdope.com has over 4million posts. 

What I like about vBulletin is that its very user friendly. It just works like you would expect it too so you would never think the software is getting in the way. When the software becomes so instictive that you stop knowing its there then you know its pretty user friendly.

I've been using the DB package for the ST Parser sports data project, 
because I want my program to run on lots of different DBMS's.

This package in particular is good, and with a bit of touch up work, could
be great.  I have tried, and continue try, to contribute to it.  
Unfortunately, the developers could do a better job of listening,
accepting submissions and answering a few obscure, but key, questions
which would help me help them.  I think I'm close to getting some
improvements in there.

Fortunately, there are some energenic new people involved.  Plus, each 
package has a different maintainer, so mileage may vary.  Also, a new 
governing body has been established to help coordinate/plan things.  
Standards for documentation and other things have been put in place, which 
is great.

Well, that's all for now,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Searching DMOZ using PHP.
Message-ID: <000601c3bae6$ff4a7520$6401a8c0@main>

Hello everyone,

I did a project about a year ago which interfaced with DMOZ for DMOZ
directories and search results. What client wanted was to list results from
his own database on top and then list DMOZ results. I implemented a fairly
straight forward caching system for the categories since they are not
updated as often. But the searching part is directly fetched from DMOZ for
every search.

Here is what I used back then to get search results:

===============================
// prepare search URL for DMOZ.
$searchurl = $searchurl . $searchstring . ($start == "" ? "" : "&start=" .
$start ) . 
($morecat == "" ? "" : "&morecat=" . $morecat);

$fp = fopen( $searchurl, "r" );
$html = join( "", file( $searchurl ) );
fclose ( $fp );
===============================

I have been contacted by the client to revise the code. Along with a few
other things, search results retrieval from DMOZ needs to be looked at again
and optimized. 

I need suggestions as to how I can change the above code to make it better.
Storing RDF dump on the local server is out of the question, as the site is
on a shared server and will not have enough disk space to fit the dump onto
disk/database. 

Thanks,
Nasir

In that syntax, use ' instead of ".

I'd break that up for clarity.  But, of course, that's a style question...

$searchurl = $searchurl . $searchstring;
if ($start) {
    $searchurl .= "&start=$start";
}
if ($morecat) {
    $searchurl .= "&morecat=$morecat";
}

Some folks might change those if's into one liners, but "that's not my 
style."

$html = file_get_contents($searchurl);

Hi Shawn,

New York PHP has a budget for these things.  Try to get a quote for Kinkos
and let me know how much it is.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] array of object being passed by reference problem
Message-ID: <LOEFKOAGKFPIIPNAKJLAOEAHCPAA.jeffb@uniquephoto.com>

I have the following test script:

<?php

class testObj{

	var $junk;
	var $objs;

	function testObj()
	{
	}

	function populate()
	{
		for( $i = 0; $i < 5; $i++ )
		{
			$o = &new testObj();
			$o->setVar($i);
			$this->objs[] = $o;
		}
	}

	function setVar( $id )
	{
		$this->junk = $id;
		print "set ".$this->junk."<br>";
	}

	function getObjs()
	{
		return $this->objs;
	}

	function printall()
	{
		foreach($this->objs as $pos => $o )
		{
			print "print ".$o->junk."<br>";
		}
	}
}

$obj = new testObj();

$obj->populate();

$objs = &$obj->getObjs();

print "<br>";

foreach($objs as $pos => $o )
{
	print $o->junk."<br>";
}

foreach( $objs as $pos => $o )
{
	$o->setVar("aa".$pos);
	print "<br>";
}

foreach( $objs as $pos => $o )
{
	print $o->junk."<br>";
}

$obj->printall();

?>

Which is putting out the following to the screen:

set 0
set 1
set 2
set 3
set 4

0
1
2
3
4
set aa0

set aa1

set aa2

set aa3

set aa4

0
1
2
3
4
print 0
print 1
print 2
print 3
print 4

The problem, after the set aa0...aa4 lines I should not be seeing 0...4 and
print 0...print 1. I should be seeing aa0...aa4 and print aa0...print aa4.
The problem seems to lie in how I am passing the array of objects to the
calling program and then having those changes be a part of the object, seems
like I am just changing a copy of the object since the changes are not
sticking. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Help out a comparative beginner here. Why is interdependency a bad thing?
If A, B and C depend on Y, it means they are all (re-)using Y, which leads
-- does it not? -- into the virtuous circle of code re-use: code getting
used, bugs getting discovered, followed by bugs getting fixed, leading to
more robust code, hence more re-use.

Yeah, I can see where parsing and loading 2500 lines of code of which you
only need %10 is a performance hit in an interpreted language, -- leaner
and meaner equals faster. But doesn't hardware evolve in the direction of
faster, and isn't PHP itself's performance being improved so that it's
ever faster at loading PHP code?

Thanks.

I think the argument goes something like this:

Each module should do one thing and do it well (ala Unix philosophy). For
example, on a Unix system, I can grep through the output of ps by doing
something likethis:

ps | grep foo

Both grep and foo are independent, but they can be combined. Code can work
in much the same way. If grep cannot be used without ps, or if ps cannot
be used without grep, this would be seen by many as a shortcoming.

Hope that helps. I can elaborate, but that's the basic idea.

Chris

On second thought:

Suppose -- just hypothetically -- I write a shell script that greps the ps
output for a user-specified string. I could say, here's my shell script
and you're welcome to use it, but it depends on ps and grep being
installed on your system. Is it not a good shell script? Should it have
its own ps and grep functionality built in, independently?

fwiw, I'm not arguing for argument's sake, just trying to learn stuff from
y'all. thanks.

It's not just the performance hit -- which can be significant (fear the 
Smarty demo) -- there may be security implications as well. (back to the 
subject line?)

For rapid development or prototyping, there is no question that 
(re)using classes a la Pear is an attractive option. Certainly for 
specialized tasks (parsing mp3 ID3 tags comes to mind). But at some 
point, you have to take a hard look at the 90% that you're not using, 
and consider writing bespoke classes. Do this a few times and you begin 
to see Pear as not so useful.

The nice thing about OO is that the rewrite only has to implement the 
bits of the original API that your application uses. Not painless, but 
not so bad, either. Unless the class you're replacing had an inefficient 
way of doing things...

No -- but it should allow me to easily configure the path to both ps and 
grep, just in case I want to use superPs and superGrep instead.

I think it's a fine shell script, but it might not be such a good module,
if that makes sense. If someone comes along and decides that they want the
functionality of ps, grep, and something else, they should use grep and ps
separately rather than your script.

I'm not saying I'm dead set on this approach, but I understand the
argument. On the other side, such abstraction can potentially be a good
thing. I think it really depends on the situation and your personal
preference.

I would say it should certainly not have that functionality built in,
since anywhere you can run your shell script, including Windows using
Cygwin or the like, you can get ps or grep.  So why reinvent the
wheel?  The codebase behind ps and grep is likely to have benefited
from all kinds of improvements over the years.  However, compatibility
is a somewhat knotty problem, which things like Posix attempt to
address.  There will always be tradeoffs in such decisions.

An example of an interesting decision to the contrary occurred when
Tom Christiansen of Perl fame got fed up with the absence of
consistent shell tools for use in Perl scripting of systems tasks.  He
spearheaded an effort under the name "Perl Power Tools" to re-write in
pure Perl a lot of the typical tools you might find in /bin, /usr/bin
and /usr/local/bin on a BSD system.  The idea was that when done,
anywhere you could run Perl you could always have cat, grep, find,
tset, stty, ls -- even awk -- by loading the appropriate Perl module,
in case the tools weren't available in native C implementations.

I'm not sure what came of that project.  However, I think it is
interesting that the effort recognized the value of the particular
historic Unix tool set and didn't attempt to redesign them.  The
notion was to deal with systems where there might well not be a a ps
or grep yet, which is probably not the case when shell scripting.

Another interesting alternative approach is embodied in the "BusyBox"
tool: http://www.busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html

BusyBox unifies the executable, but keeps the separate interface.
BusyBox is also meeting a niche need: very constrained memory
environments that want the traditional Unix toolkit.

In my humble opinion, issues of what to keep separate, what to unify,
where interface lines should be drawn, when to reuse, when to
reimplement, and how best to modularize code are the most complex area
of freedom to deal with intelligently in just about any programming
task, and there is no simple rule for doing it right.  Your individual
situation should always guide your decision.

There's part of me that says a request can take up to a second before I

thanks, I've exchanged a few msgs with a developer on a 
Sourceforge project I'm interested in, and suggested he 
either use Smarty or at least put the table and form 
handling logic in classes (it was in reference to an 
internationalization issue, since the code is not structured 
to handle it)

I haven't got them (I think). I'll re-profile the code and post in on the

I think it's key to cut a distinction between code reuse, modularity, and frameworks.

PEAR is a framework.  Just as in a house, if a load-bearing beam is removed, the structure will crumble.  This is the typical architecture of a framework.

However, imagine if you could build a house with no load-bearing beams.  The house, and the functionality it provides, is a composite of many smaller beams - and if one is removed or changed, the structure and functionality withstands.  Sure, each beam is dependent on it's peers to operate fully and deliver the ultimate functionality required, but it's not totally integrated - there might be plastic beams, wood beams, steel, etc.  And, each beam can be reused to shape the total structure differently - this is a modular or component based architecture.

In essence, it's not easy, nor would it make sense [1], to only use a piece of a framework - it's all or nothing - and the PEAR/CPAN model is akin to this.  It is important to remember, however, that sometimes this is the correct model - take FreeBSD ports collection... :)  While there is a great deal of dependency, it's a "closed" system - no one is using the ports system to develop an ecommerce site, then a login system and a mailing list.

FWIW, from what I've heard, Smarty performance is significantly
improved when you use apc, or some similar opcode caching product.

does this sound right?  or could i have done this without editing the

It's slow, the code is a mess, and it is a frequent visitor of Dan's
Security Focus PHP vulnerability updates.

It looks good, though. :-)

Aside from the suggestions others made about being able to drop in new
versions of ps and grep for flexibility, I'll point out that ps, grep, and
whatever shell your script is written for *do* have dependencies, e.g. libc.
They don't each include their own I/O routines, signal handling, memory
management, etc.

I think part of the difficulty with this discussion w/r/t PHP is the fuzzy
line the core PHP distribution provides between traditional language
features and added functionality (i.e. there is setcookie() so you don't
have to make your own cookie headers with header(), but you can't write new
cookies to $_COOKIE like you can create new session variables by writing to
$_SESSION; or even the fact that there is a bundledd session module) and the
competing standards for add-on frameworks that handle a set (itself fuzzily
defined) of "standard" web programming tasks like form handling, error
management, templating, and so on.

Which flows nicely into what Hans wrote:

PHP doesn't provide everything you need for a web framework (IMHO there are
good arguments for and against this) so there are various possible
frameworks out there. For most projects, I think that the benefit of
choosing something widely known and good enough far outweighs the potential
speed or customization benefits from writing your own.

Jeff buddy!! Remember me? :)

"foreach" isn't object friendly... It's giving you copies to modify!!
Here is a work around for what you want to achieve..

Change line:   $o->setVar("aa".$pos);

To:            $objs[$pos]->setVar("aa".$pos);

This will yield the results you want.  I tried it, works like a champ.
Remember: modification of array elements via indices is your php4 friend
		especially when dealing with objects! :)

I have the following test script:

<?php

class testObj{

	var $junk;
	var $objs;

	function testObj()
	{
	}

	function populate()
	{
		for( $i = 0; $i < 5; $i++ )
		{
			$o = &new testObj();
			$o->setVar($i);
			$this->objs[] = $o;
		}
	}

	function setVar( $id )
	{
		$this->junk = $id;
		print "set ".$this->junk."<br>";
	}

	function getObjs()
	{
		return $this->objs;
	}

	function printall()
	{
		foreach($this->objs as $pos => $o )
		{
			print "print ".$o->junk."<br>";
		}
	}
}

$obj = new testObj();

$obj->populate();

$objs = &$obj->getObjs();

print "<br>";

foreach($objs as $pos => $o )
{
	print $o->junk."<br>";
}

foreach( $objs as $pos => $o )
{
	$o->setVar("aa".$pos);
	print "<br>";
}

foreach( $objs as $pos => $o )
{
	print $o->junk."<br>";
}

$obj->printall();

?>

Which is putting out the following to the screen:

set 0
set 1
set 2
set 3
set 4

0
1
2
3
4
set aa0

set aa1

set aa2

set aa3

set aa4

0
1
2
3
4
print 0
print 1
print 2
print 3
print 4

The problem, after the set aa0...aa4 lines I should not be seeing 0...4 and
print 0...print 1. I should be seeing aa0...aa4 and print aa0...print aa4.
The problem seems to lie in how I am passing the array of objects to the
calling program and then having those changes be a part of the object, seems
like I am just changing a copy of the object since the changes are not
sticking. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Crap! After hunting high and low that's what I went with for a recent project. I agree, it does look really nice and skins very easily. 

I'm surprised I haven't seen a product that functions like YahooGroups. Bulletin boards are nice but I think it's a fabulous idea to mesh with listserv like behavior. Has anyone come across something like this? Or better yet is there a solution that would seemlessly integrate with a product like EZMLM (I know I'm hoping for a lot here). Thanks.

Well ... Ive recently modded phpBB (which despite the contrary) to accept "forum subscriptions" which takes the place of a mailing list.  Ive notice that *no* board does this which I found suprising.  Basically on the profile Ive added subscriptions:

[  ] Forum Name

In which its more or less like "Notify me of replies in this forum/category" (vs. thread) ... then in the email have a reply link back to the board ... 

The other pretty neat feature is using the bad words regex replacements to cross link into your FAQ or a glossary for defining words.  (or anything to help newbies without getting more intermediate/advance users frustrated in broad topics/forums) ...

I find all php boards code crap - but either one once you have a know of what each part does u can really just run + go with it ... the security mess is all over the place i think, its not something that just pertains to that app ...

It has a weird connection with what I am guessing the power contacts on either side of the SCSI connection instead of a Molex (?) connector like most drives. So I'm guessing this drive came out of a portable unit and would need such a housing.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] sqlite utility and reloading a dump
Message-ID: <3FD24C27.2070205@att.net>

Hello all,

I understand there are a couple people working on PHP5 on 
the list, so I'll begin here.

In the process of converting a PHP application that uses 
MySQL to use SQLite, I naturally started with converting the 
schema into something that SQLite understood, e.g. INTEGER 
PRIMARY KEY for auto_increment and so forth.  The file I am 
working with was created by phpMyAdmin which of course 
escapes single quotes within single-quoted strings with \'

In firing up the sqlite.exe utility on a W2KPro box, I was 
getting "unrecognized token" errors.  SQLite lets you read 
in a file with the command ".read FILENAME", once sqlite is 
invoked.  I traced the error detection to the tokenizer.c 
file where an illegal token flag was being set when checking 
the \' sequence with a case statement of case '\'':

I then went and downloaded sqlite version 2.8.7 -- just 
releases -- same indication.

After going back and forth several times with SQLite's 
author, D. Richard Hipp, who was very responsive, he allowed 
that I could submit an enhancement to have a PRAGMA which 
turn on backslash escapes.

My question is: hasn't this behavior come up before in light 
of the fact that SQLite is being included in PHP5?

thanks,
John

When escaping "'" without the use of an ESCAPE clause, most DBMS's, and 
perhaps the SQL-99 standard itself, use "''"

MySQL kind of made up it's own thing by doing "\'"  Do note, you can also
use "''" in MySQL (at least in version 4.0, maybe in 3.2x too).

yeah, I pointed out the "''" method of escaping to the

Have you tried running mysqldump with the --fields-escaped-by
parameter? Maybe you can make MySQL ouput '' instead of \'.

Note: I have no idea if this command actually does this, I was just
browsing the manual.

fudforum has a very interesting mailing list/newsgroup integration thing.

Also, what about having a mailing list like Mailman, with some nice 
archiving programs running (mhonarc, etc), and have a web-to-mail script 
to allow browsers to participate. I know there can be security issues 
with allowing people to send mail through web pages, but could be done.

in this case, I'm working with a file that comes packaged 
with an application  -- in one of my emails to Mr. Hipp, I 
included a link to the php manual addslashes() function with 
the info about magic quotes, etc, etc.

I think that's for what fields are enclosed in, such as the double quotes 
in the following
   "field1", "field2"

Eddy,

Definitely remember you!

I found that out the hard way and my boss found a very interesting aspect
that I had never used and only seen once or twice in C type code.

function & method1()
{
	return $this->arrayOfPointers;
}

Notice the & before the method1, that does some nice magic. Makes the
function return pointers, not so sure how it makes that determination yet.
Trying return & $this->arrayOfPointers; gives a syntax error. I am also
curious to find out what the difference is when you preceded the constructor
with the &, does it have global effects? Those more detailed questions will
have to wait until I get this project done.

Thanks for the help Eddy.

Jeff

Message-ID: <000201c3bda1$56fa1480$bf8d3818@oberon1>

Has anybody loaded the php_mysql extension under windows?
I wanted to test/experiment with something using a php client 
connection to MySQL 4.1.0 (alpha).

I am using a precompiled php 5.0b2
dated 30-Oct-2003.

If I check the dependencies of the php_mysql.dll
it seems like in the php4ts.dll library
'_zend_hash_add_or_update' and 'OnUpdateLong'
are both unresolved.

As a footnote both the php4ts.dll and the php_mysl.dll 
are the ones which came with the precompiled php 
(in a zip file)

Any ideas/comments would be appreciated.

Do note a few things.  They're called "references," which are kind of like
pointers, but aren't true pointers.  Establishing a function like that is
termed "returning by reference."  Only return variables from such methods.  
Most people use the style with the & is next to the function name:  
"function &method()"  Finally, the reference isn't created unless the call
to the function says it should via the =&:

   $foo =& method1();

FYI,

Since the scheme to fix the MySQL \' issue with a PRAGMA 
(PRAGMA backslash_escapes=ON;) will be off by default, I 
sent a msg to Marc Delisle -- phpMyAdmin developer.  He said 
he'd add a feature to support two single quote exports.

so, the SQLite utility will be covered by an option to honor 
one of the MySQL escape methods (\') and the phpMyAdmin app. 
will be able to optionally use two single quotes when exporting

I'm not too familiar with the Windows precompiled binaries (although I've had PHP4 and MySQL humming along under WinXP) but if you're using a PHP 5 beta, why is it php4ts.dll?  Might be something to check out, and/or go to http://snaps.php.net and get the latest and greatest.

Very observant Hans.  Those names are correct for now.

This DLL naming matter has been brought up to the developers, but there 
has been no indication as to whether or not this will change.

I hope it does get modified because it would make it possible to easily
run PHP 4 and PHP 5 on the same machine.

Later,

In-Reply-To: <3FD4D9EA.20707@nyphp.com>
Message-ID: <E1ATU6P-0000tW-00@gull.mail.pas.earthlink.net>

I thought the 1969 date limitiation was just a Windows issue, but I have
just run into the same problem on a client's web site hosted by Rapidsite.
Rapidsite is hosting a PHP CGI implementation on Apache on IRIX on a SGI
server.  

Here's the test code:

echo formatdate("1970-01-30");
echo "<br>";
echo formatdate("1969-01-30");
echo "<br>";
echo formatdate("1959-01-30");
echo "<br>";


function formatdate($szdate)
{
	if  (isset($szdate) && ($szdate != "0000-00-00"))
	{
		$date = strtotime($szdate);
		$arrdate = getdate($date);
		$rtn = checkdate($arrdate['mon'], $arrdate['mday'] ,
$arrdate['year']);
		if($rtn)
		{
			return ($arrdate['mon'] . "/" . $arrdate['mday'] .
"/" . $arrdate['year']);
		}else{
			return $szdate;
		}
	}
	return "";
	
}

The results I get on Rapidsite is:

1/30/1970
12/31/1969
12/31/1969

I ran the same code on another host and got the correct results

1/30/1970
1/30/1969
1/30/1959

Has anybody seen this problem before?  Is there a work around?

Thanks,

No no.. it stems from the UNIX timestamp being a signed 32bit int - I think Windows just copied that.

Basically, some of the functions you use in formatdate() are using the UNIX timestamp behind the scenes.  For the most part, these can't handle anything before the Epoch (something like the last second in 1969 - a good year).

Obviously, this is platform dependant.  Out of curiosity, what os/architecture was able to handle this (it means the time operations can use a negative number - most cannot).

Basically, it's summed up in the Note at http://us2.php.net/strtotime

> Has anybody seen this problem before?  Is there a work around?

The only workaround is to use a "real" date format (like a date format in MySQL/Oracle) or implement some of your own time/date manipulation functions - this begins to be painfull very quickly, so I's recommended a different time/date storage format :)

I think this will be fixed for Beta 3, which should be out in a week
or so.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Framework Question - Site Configuration
Message-ID: <042001c3be99$d809f1f0$640a0a0a@webdev>

Framework question.

I had an idea that if I were to store many of the web site configuration
values in the web server environment, such as database connection
parameters, default email address, company address and major site links in
each apache server virtual host environment, this information would be
resident in the server memory, and subsequent requests would require less
over head than creating a large configuration file that would be loaded and
parsed at runtime each time a script on our site ran.

For example. In my apache config I set the values in the following manner...

setEnv    DATABASE_NAME    = "somedatabase"
setEnv    DATABASE_USER    = "someuser"
setEnv    DATABASE_PASS    = "somepass"
setEnv    LINK_HOME_PAGE = "/index.php"
setEnv    LINK_SITE_MAP = "/site-map.php"
setEnv    EMAIL_DEFAULT = "info at foo.com"
setEnv    EMAIL_SALES = "sales at foo.com"
setEnv    PATH_PHOTOS = "/photos/"
setEnv    PATH_GIFS = "/gifs/"

To access these from my scripts, I can use the following...

$_SERVER['DATABASE_NAME']
$_SERVER['DATABASE_USER']
$_SERVER['DATABASE_PASS]
$_SERVER['LINK_HOME_PAGE']
$_SERVER['LINK_SITE_MAP]

Because they are resident in the memory of the server, the server does not
have to parse the file each time a request is made for the virtual host.

However, this is proving to be a pain because there are other scripts that
run from CRON etc, that do not run from the virtual host environment, and
for those scripts, I have ended up duplicating my efforts by creating
another configuration file for our site. This means I have to update changes
to the configuration twice.

I was thinking that it would may be easier to ditch this effort and go with
a standard configuration file in PHP that I can include for the site and
scripts that run outsode the virtual environment. Perhaps something like the
following...

<?php

define(DATABASE_NAME,'somedatabase');
define(DATABASE_USER,'someuser');
define(LINK_SITE_MAP,'/site-map.php');

?>

and then access the values in the script using their constant values or
perhaps store the values in an array such as...

<?php

$site = array(
'DATABASE_NAME' => 'somedatabase',
'DATABASE_USER' => 'someuser',
'LINK_SITE_MAP' => '/site_map.php'
);

?>

I would like to hear all your thoughts on this issue. I have about 100
configuration directives I would like to be able to store in one place. I
would be curious how others have dealt with simular issues. Are there
advantagaes to using an array for config values as mentioned above over lets
say defining constants?

Ideas, suggestions?

Thanks.

One thing I have experimented with is saving configs in a plain text
config file in the format that parse_ini_file likes. Then you can do this
if you want

$cfg = parse_ini_file('/path/to/config.conf');
foreach($cfg as $key => $value) {
	define($key,$value);
}

...or not. Works for me.

One nice thing is that you if you happen to use Perl as well for some
reason, there's the Config::General module that can also read the same
config file. (The one gotcha is the different comment syntax). In any case
you should be able to achieve the objective of centralizing the config
info.

But I've seen other apps use both of the approaches you refer to above.
TMTOWTDI, as they say.

Personally, I prefer using constants defined in a config file. Since, by 
convention, constants are normally all in CAPS, then mispelling a 
constant name immediately throws up a parse error. In addition, it's a 
visual indicator to me that its value has been set "somewhere" in my 
app. It would seem that using an array, one could inadvertantly change 
the value whereas once a constant is defined, that's that...no mucking 
around with its value.

If you have the ability to compile extensions into PHP and you're not
running under Windows you may find useful an extension I wrote that is one
solution to this problem (and more).

http://pwee.sourceforge.net/

Note that I haven't yet compiled it under anything later than PHP 4.2.1.

I have used both the CONSTANTS and array. To be frank, arrays have proven to
be a PITA. And as Jeff has pointed out, they stand out from rest of the code
being in all caps.

Put 'em all in one text/php file, and use auto_prepend:

php_value auto_prepend /home/usr/includes/config.inc  (with correct path to

If you rather stick with your current setup, you can try to transfer all the
directives from httpd.conf to a local .htaccess file, that way your
directives will not be in affect globally.

The site that succesfully handled pre-epoch dates is hosted by Hostway.

I need to setup a simple mailing list for someone.  One way, no discussions.
Users need to be able to subscribe/unsubscribe themselves.  And a relatively
easy administration module for adding users and sending mail to be used by
novices.
 
The site's host is Interland on an NT account but they do supposedly have
PHP access as well as CGI (although ASP would be good too).  Any suggestions
for either packages that are cheap/free or 3'rd party services that would
host the list for them?

what is the name of the 'mail agent'
(on unix it might be 'sendmail')

Is it really hosted on NT -- don't you mean
Windows 2000 (2003) server?

Are you using BackOfficeServer, SmallBusinessServer,
Exchange Sever (what release), or what?

Also how hard is it to effect changes in the 
environment (e.g. will you have privileges to 
make dns record changes or does Interland
do it for you -- and how long does it take them)

Without more specifics on your environment it is 
hard to help.

If you are looking for a commercial solution, try www.lyris.com , they
have a package called listmanager for nt/2k/red hat.  A free version is
available to try out (but with limitations such as, creation of one
list, and a max of 200 members).

yep -- also CONSTANTS are globally scoped... so do not need any prior

The first "['name']" is the name of your file field. The second 'name' is

Hi all,

I'm looking for an open source help desk / support / ticketing system written in PHP. 
Preferably free, but it doesn't have to be free. We just need to be able to modify it to our needs.

Here is a list of features that it would ideally have:

0. Web capture of new tickets.
1. Email capture of new tickets.
2. You can send back replies or the info via email.
3. Customizable ticket workflow.
4. Highly customizable: Categories request types, statuses, etc.
5. Reporting tools and trends: How many requests of type X in past month, etc.
6. Good permissioning system (admin can define who can do what).
7. Internal notes.
8. Sending email and notes to user groups.

I checked on sourceforge.net, but was wondering if anyone knows of other alternatives.

Thanx,
Ophir

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Looking for PHP help desk system

Hi all,
 
I'm looking for an open source help desk / support / ticketing system
written in PHP. 
Preferably free, but it doesn't have to be free. We just need to be able to
modify it to our needs.
 
Here is a list of features that it would ideally have:
 
0. Web capture of new tickets.
1. Email capture of new tickets.
2. You can send back replies or the info via email.
3. Customizable ticket workflow.
4. Highly customizable: Categories request types, statuses, etc.
5. Reporting tools and trends: How many requests of type X in past month,
etc.
6. Good permissioning system (admin can define who can do what).
7. Internal notes.
8. Sending email and notes to user groups.
 
I checked on sourceforge.net, but was wondering if anyone knows of other
alternatives.
 
Thanx,
Ophir

Thanks for the replies

Win2K / NT - same basic thing, different version.  This server's W2K fwiw.

None of the MS backoffice stuff is setup.  It has IIS, ASP.net with basic
ODBC, MySQL or SQL Server, PHP, CGI - and Qmail with the lists function
disabled.

I looked at Lyris.  It can get very expensive.  The commercial version of
Topica seems a bit more reasonable at around $225 a year.  It's also really
friendly.

For a different site, I have one of those really cheap $4/month Linux hosts.
It has Mailman 2.1 which seems quite extensive - maybe too much so.  I've
been trying to customize and simplify the screens the end user sees but it's
been pretty hard.  They don't need to see all of the things related to open
discussions, digests, or managing their user options.  But even if I get it
right the admin piece is still going to be a little confusing for the people
maintaining the lists.

Ideally I'd like something simpler than Mailmain.  More user friendly.  And
hopefully where I don't have to pay 200 every year.

I've seen a lot of other PHP and ASP based list managers on Hotscripts.com.
Just wondering if there are any standouts that people here have implemented.

 Kind regards
 -Bill

what is the name of the 'mail agent'
(on unix it might be 'sendmail')

Is it really hosted on NT -- don't you mean Windows 2000 (2003) server?

Are you using BackOfficeServer, SmallBusinessServer, Exchange Sever (what
release), or what?

Also how hard is it to effect changes in the environment (e.g. will you have
privileges to make dns record changes or does Interland do it for you -- and
how long does it take them)

Without more specifics on your environment it is hard to help.

However, this link might be of some use:

I need to setup a simple mailing list for someone.  One way, no discussions.
Users need to be able to subscribe/unsubscribe themselves.
And a relatively easy administration module for adding users and sending
mail to be used by novices.

The site's host is Interland on an NT account but they do supposedly have
PHP access as well as CGI (although ASP would be good too).  Any suggestions
for either packages that are cheap/free or 3'rd party services that would
host the list for them?


Thanks

Hi Michael:

Nasir answered the question regarding where to find the file info.

Can I give you some style advice that will garner you better performance
and acceptance amongst the larger programming community?

* Put a space around the equals sign when doing assignments -- making it 
  more readable.

* Put single quotes around the array's keys -- averting PHP having to 
  waste time trying to find a constant named "name" that doesn't exist
  then having to guess that you mean't the string "name."

>   $name=$_POST[name];

    $name = $_POST['name'];

* Finally, don't waste code, execution time or memory by reassigning the 
  post variables.  Just use $_POST['name'] where you need it.  If you need
  to use it in a string, put {} around it like this
      echo "The submitted filename is {$_POST['name']}";
  or break it out like this
      echo 'The submitted filename ' . is {$_POST['name']};
  Take note of the single quotes vs the double quotes.

Enjoy,

Here we use Tracksolve - by SI Media. http://www.simedia.com/tracksolve/

it is currently $549.95 for the zend encrypted one, but about in july we
bought the developer edition - $1000 for the un-encrypted program. I think
its really slick, and works great. We are in the process of implementing it,
and adding any new features we feel are necessary to our hospital.

Message-ID: <05F6C3B4CA00D7419D1708F36A9F7745B27F@ffth-exc01.thompsonhealth.org>

Most of the web servers I have worked on that have been linux have been
shared hosting, with all of the php libs included. I just bought a dedicated
server from ev1servers.net, and consolidated our sites onto 1 server.

I noticed that my image functions were displaying red x's instead of showing
graphs. I run the script directly,
http://www.replaysx.net/ratingbar.php?rating=0 , and I get:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imagecreate() in
/home/replaysx/public_html/ratingbar.php on line 136

My phpinfo is at http://www.keithjr.net/phpinfo.php

The only servers that I configured php for were Mac OS X and Windows 2000
under IIS 5, and all of the functions came compiled with the version that I
downloaded for Mac OS X, and you can add extentions in Win2k with the
php.ini.

I searched for a bit, and I am coming up short on how to add the image
library support. Im sure all of you on here have done it multiple times, so
I figured that this would be the shortest route to my answer :)

thank you all!

also look at:
http://www.php.net/~rasmus/gd.html

you might want to change the above to
something like:

1) download GD 2.0.15 
2) untar it (tar zxvf gd-2.0.15.tar.gz)
3) cd to the gd directory (gd/gd-2.0.15)
4) Change the makefile libs to be 
     LIBS=libgd.a -lpng -lz -ljpeg -lfreetype -lm
5) make libgd.a   
6) Build PHP using these flags:
   --with-gd=/home/gd/gd-2.0.15 
    (or wherrever you put the gd lib)
   --with-freetype-dir=/usr
   --enable-gd-native-ttf  
   --enable-gd-imgstrttf
   --with-jpeg-dir=/usr
   --with-png-dir=/usr
   --with-zlib

Warning: I never did this
but it might work...

Good luck.

Basic question. What is/are the recommended strategies for dealing with
the lost update problem in a PHP/MySQL application? The scenario I'm
thinking of is not the old shirt inventory example which can be solved
with relative as opposed to absolute updates. I'm thinking:  User1
requests a page containing a form populated by a row of John Customer's
data from a table; so does User2. User1 updates John Customer's work phone
in the form and User2 updates John Customer's home phone. User1 submits
form/updates table, then User2 does likewise, overwriting User1's update.

I've done considerable RTFM and I'm conversant with locks, transactions,
etc. I'm uncertain about how to put it all together in a web app, i.e.,
with lots of short-lived independent scripts running in a stateless
environment.

The possible approaches I can think of are a little cumbersome -- I'll
spare you, for the sake of brevity.

Any pointers to tutorials, articles etc are appreciated. Thanks.

1. Include a "last_update" column in the table. This can be a timestamp or
just a monotonically increasing integer that changes with each update.

2. When you read the record and display the form, include the last_update
value as a hidden field in the form.*

3. When the form is submitted, check to see that the last_update value
submitted with the form is the same as the value in the database before
updating.**

4. If the values don't match, take some application-appropriate behavior,
like silently overwriting with the new data; re-presenting the form to the
user with fields highlighted that have changed; etc.

5. If the values do match, then save the data, including a new value for the
last_update column.

* You may want to obfuscate or encrypt the value when you include it in the
form to discourage tampering.

** Obviously, you need to read the last_update value and have your UPDATE
occur with no other updates sneaking in between them. If you're using InnoDB
tables, use a transaction, otherwise, lock the table for writing before you
read the last_update value and then unlock it after you either write the new
data or decide that you can't write because it's changed.

I ran into the same problem not too long ago.  Solved it by sending in
the "old" field values along with the actual form values entered by the
user.

<input type="text" name="homephone" value="<?=$home_phone;?>">
<input type="hidden" name="old_homephone" value="<?=$home_phone;?>">

<input type="text" name="workphone" value="<?=$work_phone;?>">
<input type="hidden" name="old_workphone" value="<?=$work_phone;?>">

And so on.  Then, when you receive the form, check the user-entered
value against the "old" value.  If they are different, then save the new
value to the db, otherwise don't touch it.  Basically, you only update
the information that was changed by the user.  If user1 updates the home
phone number and user2 updates the work phone number, their repsective
data will not be overwritten by the other because it wasn't changed on
their form.  It seems to be working pretty well for me so far.

As a footnote if you go the timestamp route:

"When MySQL is running in MAXDB mode, TIMESTAMP behaves like DATETIME. No
automatic updating of TIMESTAMP columns occurs, as described in the
following paragraphs. MySQL can be run in MAXDB mode as of version 4.1.1.
See section 4.1.1 mysqld Command-line Options."
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/DATETIME.html

also you might try searching on 
optimistic concurrent lock(ing)
or 'dirty reads' for more background info.
here's something that might be of value:
http://www.mysql.com/documentation/maxdb/65/dd6525ed951542936005e01e2b489e
/content.htm

The optimistic lock, like the name implies,
figures the record in question is probably not
being accessed -- then at the last moment
makes sure somehow that the data hasn't 
been altered.

I thank you sir. This sounds sound. I read/heard about this technique
someplace before but I think I was thinking, yeah but what if two users
SELECT the same data simultaneously. Answer:  not your problem. If they
both try to write one of them will just have to suffer a little
inconvenience, for data integrity's sake.

Depending on how much work you want to do to prevent users from having to do
some work, you can eliminate the user inconvenience in certain
circumstances.

For example, if the two users have relative permissions or roles where it
makes sense for one of them to overwrite the others' changes, then you don't
have to re-prompt.

Or, if both users updates can be mutually compatible, then you can save both
of them with no changes. If both users have edited a text field, you can
behave like CVS -- use diff to see if the users have made changes only to
non-intersecting parts of the text field and if so, silently save both sets
of changes.

However, in practice, the "little inconvenience" that users may suffer in
this situation is usually a good thing. Simultaneous conflicting alteration
of data by two people probably means there is a workflow or business problem
with human communication and human organization -- so if your application
highlights it, the humans involved can work to fix it. ("Oh, you're handling
the updates for the customers that live in Connecticut? I though I was
supposed to be doing those.").

If you want to be *really* classy, poke around in the source to diff:
--> ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/diffutils/diffutils-2.8.1.tar.gz

And then add a function to PHP to do this without calling an external
program...!

It would be even cooler to write a UDF to do this automagically. I
wonder if that's possible.

Sounds like a fun hack.

AFAIK, UDFs can't (or, more specifically, shouldn't) access data other than
the specific arguments they're passed. So I think the answer is no.

You definitely can't, from within a UDF, begin a transaction or table lock
that applies retroactively to include the current query that fired off the
UDF.

Absolutely, either way (PHP or MySQL)

Try  text/plain  instead. I have a script that uses that same headers with

I'm actaully also interested as I'm in the process of rebuilding my login
class to fit a larger scheme of control and some better security options.
I'd originally learned a lot about php authentication through sites as well
as PAT's patUser class
(http://www.php-tools.de/site.php?file=patUser/overview.xml), which is one
of the better one's I've personally read over.

I was wondering what people find most convinient for to do this ? Do you use
just php sessions with few own helper functions, PEAR::Auth,other library,
or completely homegrown ?

I personaly find php sessions a bit aukward to use because of the a bit
none-intuative api that it has.

I've been known to roll my own but it sucked and isn't recommended (-:

Ask Hans about pauth (yo Hans!) -- which btw I started looking at and
didn't quite grok it, then my attention got diverted away.

I've also been playing a bit with PEAR::Auth, which after much research
(read: asking people here) I think is probably Good Enough but the
documentation is sparse (though not as sparse as in some PEAR packages).

Then I got interested in PhpDocumentor because although scrolling through
the source of PEAR::Auth might be enlightening, I wanted *documentation*.
PhpDocumentor worked great on my Linux box, seems broken on my Win2k --
but I digress.

PEAR::Auth certainly gets you started quickly & painlessly.

Yeah, I'm not 100% behind their implementation, but it touches on quite a
bit, and actaully a fun read in comparison to a good dea lof code I run
into.  BY control I meant by adding permissions and group control to my
current class, rather than just logged in / not and basic session
management.

I was thinkig in terms of general security functions we have Authentication and Access Controls. The system has to store representations of users identities. Groups are also representations of users because they users who represent many users.  The function of authentication is for users from outside the system to prove who they are. On the other Access Controls is a function that is separate from Authentication. System can store the rules for access controls as permissions. Would it not make sence to place those two functions in two separate modules or libraries instead of bunching it all in one place?

You make a good point.  I guess the reason they seem to have come together
in my mind is a current job for instance.  Where I have user groups who are
allowed to log into site a and some into site b and some who can log into
both.  And THEN they are allowed more detailed permissions within the sites.
I wouldn't have an issue using 2 libraries by any means but they seem as if
they would access similar funtionality, as well as the same data.  Maybe I
could have them bot hextend a user class of sorts (althouhg I'm still
questioning if I want to use DAO classes, vs. sql in the classes.

On a similar note, do you know of any good examples of an access control
class?  I have some ideas of how I might do it, but no need to recreate the
wheel, if at least while planning as im anal about writing my own stuff.

Just wondering why the headers below work well with IE but not with
Firebird. While in both cases they prompt the user to save a file to
disk, in the case of Firebird it tries to save the file (named
partslist.csv) with a "php" extension.


     Header("Content-type: text/csv\n");

Firebird is not having a problem with getting the file to download. The 
interesting thing is that Firebird insists on adding a "php" extension 
to the file name when the user is prompted to save the file to disk.

I had a problem with the beta versions of Safari - it was always saving it
as the name of the download script by default, not the filename sent. maybe
its some sort of problem like that? apple ended up fixing it in their final
release.

Quite honestly, it's not a big problem since my client doesn't use 
Firebird and downloads are only down by the website admin who uses IE.

Gotta love Javascript...
I have been trying to figure out for last 2 hours and good part of yesterday
how to measure the amount of scrolling you've done on a browser window.
 
I know about the event object, it doesn't doesn't have any properties that
indicate how many pixels you've scrolled nor does it indicate if you
scrolled
up or down.
 
I know I could just capture keypresses and figure it out but looking for a
clean solution, capturing keypresses seems too much like a work-around.
 
Sorry for OT...Thanks...

http://codepunk.hardwar.org.uk/ajs02.htm
"This tutorial will show you how to detect how far down or across a page a viewer has scrolled."

http://www.dithered.com/javascript/window_properties/index.html
"Description

Retrieving the dimensions of a window or how far a window has been scrolled requires looking at a different property in all the major browsers. This script creates one function for each quantity to simplify the process."

Hope that helps.

Just finished reading through phpgacl doc.  Pretty well written, (esp. if
your'e a star wars fan).  It seems they include system login as a permission
as well, although I see how the actual login stuff (session mngmnt, user
query / matching etc) can very well be it's own entity.  I've still y t to
page through the code, btu the doc is very enlightening on Access Control in
general.  Thanks for the link!

So here's my thoughts for a permissions system.  Don't read below this if
you're uninterested, but if you do, let me know if I'm on a good track or if
I'm just plain nuts.

Tables:

users
-----
user_id
group_id		// for a userS to group (either or, see below)
Username, etc...

groups
------
group_id
parent_id
group_title

x_users_groups	// for userS to groupS (either or, see above)
--------------
user_id
group_id

sections
--------
section_id
section_title

permissions
-----------
permission_id
permission_title [read, write, view, update, delete, etc]

x_group_permissions
-------------------
section_id
group_id
permission_id
precedence

user_perms
----------
section_id
user_id
perm_id



Ex. Can_do('news', 'view', $login->get_user_id());

Function Can_do($section, $perm, $user_id) {
	
	// Check user perms if allowed (user perms get top priority) - if
yes, return true

	...

	// Check user group perms if allowed (precedence field sets priority
in case of multiple groups) - if yes return true

	...

	// Loop through groups and check parent(s), if yes, return true

	...

	return false
}

	
That's the very basics I've got in ink.

I read the manual for phpGacl and its interesting stuff. 
It seems to be designed to give high grained permissions. Their administrative interface is hard to figure out.


I am thinking of a simpler Access Control List that is easier to administer.
We will have :
Actions, Objects, Groups , and Users
Each group contains of a list of Actions to Objects mappings. Each mapping signifies Allow and absence of it signifies Deny.
so for example:
Group Regular User { Read -> Pages }
Group Admin User { Read-> Pages, Modify-> Pages, Delete-> Pages }

This would work well if there is not so many Objects so we tread each module of the application as an Object.

Hmm.. Seems similar to my quickie drawing (consider permissions table as
"Actions" and sections table as "Objects"), which in my mind at least, says
I'm on the right track.  I tend to think better in database tables and data
relationships than in objects, I guess.

Thanks for giving it a look!

I read the manual for phpGacl and its interesting stuff. 
It seems to be designed to give high grained permissions. Their
administrative interface is hard to figure out.


I am thinking of a simpler Access Control List that is easier to administer.
We will have :
Actions, Objects, Groups , and Users
Each group contains of a list of Actions to Objects mappings. Each mapping
signifies Allow and absence of it signifies Deny.
so for example:
Group Regular User { Read -> Pages }
Group Admin User { Read-> Pages, Modify-> Pages, Delete-> Pages }

This would work well if there is not so many Objects so we tread each module
of the application as an Object.

Very true.  Something to keep in mind, however, is the visibility of
sensitive data (like passwords).  Not only could someone read the
httpd.conf itself (depending on permissions, of course) but the $_SERVER
array containing the passwords, etc. is globally available in any PHP
script running under that environment.

While define() is more expensive, performance wise, than simply
declaring a variable, using constants elsewhere in the script is faster
than variables (or so Zeev told me once).

Don't forget that Apache can include other files as other conf files.
So, for example, you could have a series of php.app.conf files with your
SetEnv directives which could also be included from cron/cli php scripts
and parsed.  True, maybe a little messy on the cli side, but worth some
thought.

Of course, the "cool" way of implementing this is with shared memory.
More complex, but probably the ultimate in speedy configuration and
flexibility.  For instance, you could have a set of scripts to manage
configuration directives, in shared memory - the config could change,
and applications would see them in real time.  I had some scripts to do
this, but they're not ready for show.  That said, PHP's shared memory
extension has some weaknesses for this type of application, and a custom
C extension would really be the way to do it.

Sorry for the crazy wrapping folks - if anyone knows how to get Outlook
2003 to wrap plain-text messages normally, please contact me offlist :)

I use my own - pAuth :)  Roles based is the way to go...

Ahh, speaking of which...

There's an older version at http://cvs.nyphp.org/cvsweb.cgi/pauth/ and I
have a much improved version that I'll be committing sometime.  That
said, the pAuth version in CVS should work well as is.

After going through numerous iterations of authorization schemes (not
authentication - that's fairly straightforward) I'm sold on roles based.
At my primary intranet site, the level of granuality for authorization
is huge - numerous projects, each with subtle differences in operation,
permissions and users.  Initially, I took a URL matching approach, which
then failed because different users need to see different aspects of a
page (or even different filesystem files) related to a single URL -
simply, URL -> filesystem translations are troublesome.  I had hacked in
action based authorization, but it quickly became clear that heavy
authorization logic should not be in an umbrella type of model. [1]

The roles model is simple - it simply answers that someone can play a
role (or group of roles) or not.  Determining what to do is left up to
the application.  This offers the ultimate in granuality.  A single page
can offer the logic, or a higher include can for a group of pages.  So
far, pAuth has worked smashingly, and I'm anxious to get the revised
version online.

H

[1] There's an exception to this.  If using an application server type
of environment, where everything is an action to begin with, then it
makes sense to add authorization logic there.  Generally, however, most
sites, especially smaller ones, are just a series of GET and POST
requests, which aren't a concrete way to determine what type of action
is actually occuring.

I agree 100% -- after taking a look at an early version of pAuth, I 
hacked together my own roles-based solution and have been quite happy 
with it.

An in-code example looks something like:

$editcontrols = '';
if ( $auth->hasRole('calendar::editor') ) {
   $editcontrols = "<a href=\"$this->url?action=edit\">edit 
$this->type</a>";
}

So if I assign user foo a role of editor in the calendar domain, then 
foo will see the edit link when he is logged-in. At the top of the edit 
script, I'll require a the editor role like so:

$auth->requireRole('calendar::editor');

If the user trying to execute the edit script isn't a calendar::editor, 
they get redirected to a no-access page and execution halts.

The role name is arbitrary, but using a domain::class notation gives you 
a lot of flexibility-- the auth object can automatically discover the 
current domain ( $auth->requireRole('editor') ) and you can define a 
class policy that says, for example, editors inherit the access rights 
of contributors.

I code in a super-domain (all) and a super-class (admin), so if some 
user has the role all::admin, they can do anything anywhere.

Doesn't matter for the example, it's a red herring and I should have 
used $obj or something.

But since you asked, that scheme is from an experiemental CMS named 
Berylium, which evals code and displays templates within the context of 
the object requested in the URL. In a Berylium template, $this refers to 
the requested object, be it directory, document, image, etc.

As confusing as it might be in a code example, it makes a lot of sense 
in context.

John,

Would it be possible for you to send the files to me too. I am also
interested in finding out how to do it.

here's a php file and an htm "save file screen" that shows 
the major parts

if you look in the add_question.php.htm file's source, 
you'll see some code near the bottom with hidden fields like 
"MAX_FILE_SIZE" etc... that's the browser picture

in the functions.inc.php file you'll see a little ways from 
the top a "pt_check_image" function -- that's the 
server-side story...

John

also, don't forget about the file uploads in php.ini file -- 
  here's a section from one of mine: (note the max file 
size, change it to whatever you need)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; File Uploads ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Whether to allow HTTP file uploads.
file_uploads = On

; Temporary directory for HTTP uploaded files (will use 
system default if not
; specified).
upload_tmp_dir = ".;C:\XAMPP\xampp\tmp"

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 2M


also, I recall something about a problem with large file 
uploads and the script max_execution_time, but I believe 
that was fixed in a later version of php

I think for starters you would need to change the php.ini settings

post_max_size = 250M
upload_max_filesize = 250M

max_execution_time = 600
 or however many seconds you think it would take to upload 250M

file_uploads = 1 (of course)

still, I'm not sure how you would get around
memory_limit
It would seem wrong to set this to 250M
or is an uploaded file not restricted by this paramater?

other than that, I can't think of anything special that the script would
require.

please share what the solution is to get 400mb files

since the encoding type is set to multipart form data,
enctype="multipart/form-data"

I don't think you have to worry about the post_max_size...

someone else step in here if I'm off base on this..

it gets written to a tmp file

Hi all. Please pardon my English, I'm an Italian guy.
IMHO the best solution would be a PHP-managed FTP upload (e.g. ftp_put,
etc.) See:  http://it.php.net/manual/en/ref.ftp.php

For a form-based-upload, however:

Instead of using: 'max_execution_time = 600' (unpolite) you should set a
time limit in the PHP script: set_time_limit(0) in order to avoid:
1) some more modification to the php.ini file if the file to be uploaded
grows in size;
2) any time-limit-is-over troubles during script execution.

file_uploads = 1 (obviously)
post_max_size MUST BE LARGER THAN upload_max_filesize
upload_max_filesize = 250M or what you want
memory_limit SHOULD BE LARGER THAN post_max_size or should set to '-1'
for no memory limit. Note that PHP must be compiled with the '
--enable-memory-limit' in the 'configure' options.

PATH to WTC -- OR -- NJ Transit to Penn Station NY
E train to Columbus Circle (59th St)
   (People to whom the 7th Ave line is more convenient, such as people 
    taking the LIRR, take the 1 train uptown to 59th / Columbus Cir)
Head south on Broadway (with traffic) or 8th Ave (against traffic)
Turn left (east) on 57th St.  Don't cross 57th St.
Hard Rock is a few steps away -- between Broadway and 7th Ave.

Hi all,

I wanted to pass on this thread from the FreeBSD-Hackers mailing list:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107148893200001&r=1&w=2

They mention some very interesting tools and techniques.  Thoughts,
suggestions or experiences from AMPers here?

Also, the mention of FreeBSD is a perfect segue for the attached message.
NYC now has a BSD group to complement Linux, PHP, etc.  Please take a look
at http://nycbug.org and hop on the mailing list: http://lists.nycbug.org

See everyone at the party tonight,

hi there:

in my scripts, i generally do a simple little check like this if i 
want to make sure something was inputted in a field, or in this case 
i am looping through an array and removing any index that lacks at 
least some text:

	if( !ereg("[[:alnum:]]+",$desc_contents[$x]) ){
		array_splice($desc_contents,$x,1);
	}

anyway, that is enough for anything i want to do in english.

however, i am now dealing with some korean and bulgarian text, and 
this fails, because those characters are not part of "alnum".  at the 
moment, i've replaced it with a check of "strlen($text)>0", but if 
the text was ";@ #^&*" it would pass the test.

so, i'm interested in how people deal with this sort of situation?

i need to check that at least some valid characters (i.e., for human 
readable content) were inputted into a form, or exist in some 
variable, but that will work for any language in the world, when the 
text in question is known to be unicode.

cheers,

PHP does not have native Unicode support. However, you should check
out the mbstring extension:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Dynamic Forms
Message-ID: <010901c3c428$288533e0$5356a8c0@CPXPDEV10>

Hi All,

I just found out that a project we're working on needs to support user customizable fields.

In other words, lets say we have a User form where we store user data.
The system has built in mandatory fields like:
Username (text)
First name (text)
Last name (text)
Birthdate (date)
Country (pulldown)

We need to give the system admin a web interface to add their own fields so they could add their own fields like:
division (pulldown)
boss's name (text)
married (checkbox)
etc.

Has anyone here already implemented something like this ?
Is there a "simple" solution to this ?
Anyone know of any packages that do this ?

I looked at a couple of open source survey packages which have this type of functionality, but ideally I'd like to find something simpler.

Thanx
Ophir

At this point, I sometimes think, maybe spend an hour with the site 
manager person and show them how to code some php input  template code. 
They can mount the whole thing in BBEdit or Homesite. Maybe week 1 they 
add a simple field, week 2 a drop down, etc.

They can also use phpAdmin or something similar to do all the field 
management. Sometimes you have to give clients what they need vs what 
they ask for. Painful for some, but worth it in the end.

On the other hand, the code is probably not that hard to write. You 
have to code for every permutation, but once you do that, just play it 
back based on form input. Write to an open file. Over-writing your html 
template each time.

Message-ID: <05F6C3B4CA00D7419D1708F36A9F7745B28B@ffth-exc01.thompsonhealth.org>

I use google's adsense - and just use the generated code.

If it were me, id store the values in a text file, or a mysql database. Then i would have a php file that i would include, say google.php - that would read the data in from the database, and then have a function, say print_adcode() that would print out the javascript adcode.

I think that should be all that you would need - but I havent played with it much myself other than getting the initial colors :)

But for client, I would have to say the same thing, just suck the users data out of the mysql database, stick it in a session, and work it that way. Have default data, so that if the client doesnt want the colors to change, then the designer has it their way :P

I looked through the image functions, and dont see anything that you would do what you want. But there are some things.

What I would do - is calculate the path of the text along the arc, and how long each of the characters are. Then you would get the bottom-left coordinates of each image, and the rotation angle.

I would then load a separate image script, that would load the image of just that character, and then rotate it, and stick it in on the arc where you want it.

It sounds like a lot of math, but it is :P Maybe someone made/will make a function to do this :P

Hi Folks:

How come the latest Security Focus news letter didn't warn me about the

As i was leaving the Hard Rock, I was starting to feel ill.  By the time I 
went to bed, I had a full blown feever.  I'm a little better now, but not 
great.

I hope no one else came down with this.

I did notice that google caches some of the colors/layouts - i changed it from vertical to horizontal on one site, and the box showed up horizontal, but the ads went vertical, so i had a bunch of white space. i hope it doesnt keep the colors the same for each page, and when someone gets it changed to their pref, the rest of them have to deal with pink and purple :P

You had the Pig Sandwich didn't you? 

Sorry, couldn't resist. If you started to feel bad on your way home, you
probably didn't catch it there, you just spread it to the rest of us...

Hope you feel better, Dan. Great to see everyone last night!

Just to clarify items.

1) *I* had the pig sandwich.
2) I feel fine.

It's because it's a "Windows" thing. ;)

Get PLENTY of rest...both my kids have gotten over something that had 
put them out of commission for five days. (Miraculously I hadn't come 
down it.)

I'm feeling a little nauseous, but it's due to the fact that my car 
rental company charged me for 2 days instead of one...  :-)

(I had the veggie sandwich)

Jeff Knight gave a great presentation on the GD Library functions in PHP.  
GD will do exactly what you want.

Since we're on the topic, I thought the food was awful. (Bright side:
the contrast between the crappiness of the food and the superb quality of
the conversation helped underscore the latter (-:) I ate pig sandwich. Had
a bit of, ahem, digestive issues today but nothing significant.

We all gotta promise -- PROMISE! -- to stay healthy. Being sick sucks.

Thanks for a great evening.

The round tables actually worked out pretty well as people hopped 
around from one table to the other.  I like that part.  It was great to 
meet as many of y'all listmembers as possible.

Look forward to seeing photos.  Apparently I took the prize for "guy 
who travelled the longest distance..."  :-)

I'd love to be wrong, but I think not. I believe you have to split the 
string into individual characters and "do the math" for each 
character's x & y coordinates and rotation. Not fun at all, unless of 
course you like math...

Well, I'm not sure how fun reviewing authorization code can be, but
we'll give it a shot :)  If there's time after the other presentations
on Tuesday, I'll give an intro to pAuth.

If you have some pictures of the night, add them on, or email them to me

I have used it, but not to build any big applications.  About a year and a
half ago, I would say.  Like with any generation tool, they will save you
alot of time *until* you need to change something, in which case, you will
need to be a PHP expert to do.  If I remember correctly, it used the db
connection classes from phplib.

I remember the interface being a little clunky, but again, that was while
ago that I used it.  Why didn't I adopt it as a development tool?  Well, I
already have my own generation mechanism. :-)

Nice job of turning around those pictures so promptly, Jeff and Mike!

That Gallery package looks pretty slick too, I keep meaning to start
playing with it... althought didn't Dan "Buzzkiller" C. post a security
notice a while back about some vulnerability in it?

Hello, 

Are there anyone who can tell me how come it is?
Thanks alot in advance.

I try to input some text from first page
(sendText.php), then pass the text to second file
(recText.php) to generate an image, then shows the
image up in first page, but those texts don't be added
to the image. If I put some fixed text in second file
(recText.php - commend out ling 6-8), it works (it
mekes sense). How can I check what variables be passed
to second file? any function can do it?

the $_POST vars are only scoped to the sendText.php file

you can't get them from recText.php

instead... call recText.php like this
recText.php?cont_mid=<?=$_POST['cont_mid']?>.....etc

since this is a GET, change $_POST in recText.php to $_GET

Even with the post variables not workng poperly, I erased the post variables and used the defaults. This shows just a black circle, and thats it.

It also caches the image, so if you do a change, you have to go and remove the newImage.png file, so it stinks for testing it :P

the $_POST vars are only scoped to the sendText.php file

you can't get them from recText.php

instead... call recText.php like this
recText.php?cont_mid=<?=$_POST['cont_mid']?>.....etc

since this is a GET, change $_POST in recText.php to $_GET

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Spring time party??
Message-ID: <3FE202C0.40704@optonline.net>

Is there any interest in having a spring time party that's NOT at the 
Hard Rock?  Here are two possibilities:
	a) meet on a weekend at Central Park. We would need a permit for a 
large gathering and we can reserve a "space" for our own use. We can't 
barbecue (which would be nice) but perhaps we can think about a six-foot 
hero or something like that. However, alcohol is, for the most part, 
verboten
(see: 
http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/events/ev_faqs_manhattan.html)

	b) sunny Port Washington is only 40 minutes by train and we can do the 
dogs/burgers/beer thing at my home and we don't need a permit.

	Any other ideas?

Hey, if you have it in Port Washington, a bet a bunch of LIPHPer's would go.

Keep in mind that Corona is my beer of choice...when it comes to 
accompanying dogs on grill.

While the park things sounds appealing I would have to agree with JK  
that verboten and alcohol != a feasible option.  Your house sounds  
great despite the fact that it's 40 minutes in the wrong direction!

I haven't been in a couple of years myself, but I used to enjoy group  
camping here:

http://www.nps.gov/fiis/Camping/camping.html
http://www.watchhillfi.com/camping.htm

We can definitely drink (there is a liquor store a ten minute walk from  
the campsite) & eat (BBQ!). The group site is a large circle big enough  
to accommodate even the largest nerdathon. As camping goes, it is  
probably the most comfortable place I've been. Nearby  
restaurant/grocery store/liquor store, solar-heated showers, etc. The  
ground is sand and quite comfortable, and the constant sound of the  
ocean always makes me sleep well (especially with a belly-full of that  
devil juice).

To get to the island, you need to take a ferry from Patchogue (about an  
hour from Penn Station). The location is mainly a dockage for boat  
people (why do those people spend so much money to sit at a dock and  
watch tv?), but has a small shack for coffee and bacon egg & cheezes  
for those of us unwilling to make our own in the a.m.

I'm glad to see that someone noticed that. :-)

Only one person has taken advantage of my offer so far, so it's not
exactly a big hit. Oh well, it's the thought that counts, right?

Heh, well my benevolence has its bounds, but only due to a lack of time,
not because I'm not a nice guy. :-)

I'm willing to review code that accompanies a description of the
implementation or just the description. I don't want to dig through lots
of files of raw code just to figure out your approach, when you could
easily just tell me. It seems like a poor use of our collective time. :-)

I also admit that my motivation is lessened by the lack of interest more
than my lack of time.

Chris

Aaron,

Excuse me...but *I* happen to think that it is 40 minutes in the RIGHT 
direction. Did I forget to mention that, a mere 40 minutes in the 
"wrong" direction, you can be at the dock that overlooks the harbor and 
Long Island sound...or did I forget to mention the local seafood 
restaurants at the dock...or our local steak houses...or our sushi 
restaurants (3 of them)...our Thai restaurant...or our Italian 
restaurants (too many to count)...or our Mexican/Central American 
restaurants (2 of them)...or our pubs with great food (again...too many 
to count)...or our Chinese restaurants (too many to count) and the 
restaurant service in general where you don't get treated like we did in 
HRC.

And when I want to see the "big" world, besides being able to be in 
Manhattan in 40 minutes with a single train ride, I could be in downtown 
Flushing (25 minutes) where the food rivals ANYTHING you may find in 
Manhattan's Chinatown...in fact...it's hard to classify downtown 
Flushing as a little Chinatown since you can get Thai, Vietnamese, 
Korean and many other types of food at great prices. A few additional 
minutes and you can be at Shea Stadium (very handy when I went to the 
Springsteen concert) or at the Tennis Center.

NOW what do you have to say for yourself!

Jeff
P.S. Notice how I controlled myself and didn't say that *you* lived 3 
hours in the wrong direction? How's that for self-restraint? 
(Ooops...darn...I said it.)

P.P.S. On a more serious note, downtown Flushing would be a great place 
to meet to get some fantastic food.

That looks much more focused. :-) I'll have a look and consider this
submission number two.

I'm not sure what you mean, but I meant the lack of interest in my offer
in general, not your lack of interest. And yes, asking for elaboration
sounds like something I would say, since deciphering someone's intentions
from code alone is more time consuming and error-prone.

Hi Folks:

I'd mentioned to a few folks that I was working on determing how to foramt
dates in a wide variety of database systems.  Well, I FINALLY got it all

Message-ID: <000701c3c5f1$a39e8110$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

greetings ...

sounds like i missed a great party :-\

i have a quick question ... below is something i currently have on 2
websites which now want to integrate Google AdSense and im trying to figure
it out ... first both sites use Session URL rewrite ...

-snip-
Your website is using session ID's in the URL.
If your web pages use session ID's, you may not receive targeted ads on
those pages. Since this session ID - and therefore the URL - changes every
time a different user views a page, the URL will not be in the index and
will be queued to be crawled. Once the URL is crawled, however, the session
will most likely have expired. This means that pages seen by the users are
never in the index. You will need to remove the session ID's in order to
display targeted ads.
-snip-

However their crawler lists a User-Agent as:
Mediapartners-Google*

So does anyone think I could create a single dynamic page/catalog (acting
like static) for that user agent and then redirecting all other requests to
the main site? (http://www.website.com/google.php) ...

Offhand (I forgot the robots.txt syntax to direct all requests to that
location, anyone know?)

Will research more but wanted to see how others were handling the same
situation ...

Does/would this work w/ robots effectively?

User-Agent: googlebot
Disallow:

User-Agent: Mediapartners-Google*
Disallow:

@ top of the page:

if (preg_match("/Google/i", $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) {
    header("Location: google.php");
    exit();

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Need page refresh solution after form data processing
Message-ID: <1071858178.3fe342020c371@www.protchkocreative.com>


I am trying unsuccessfully to eliminate the browser warning that it "can't 
refresh the page without re-submitting the form data" when refreshing my form 
page after it is submitted. Though refreshing the page wouldn't be typical, I 
want to eliminate any potential user confusion.
Browser: IE6

The form is processed as:
<FORM NAME="request" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>" METHOD="POST">

which then takes some action in the form:

if($beenSubmitted) {
         //concatenate results
           ...
         //mail results
          }

AND serves the form again!

I have some sense it has to do with caching of header info. I have 
unsuccessfully tried various header("xyz'); statements after processing the 
form and before serving the HTML, including many suggested in the 
documentation. I have googled. Again, haven't found suggestion that works, or 
that I'm implementing correctly. I am not very knowledgable in the smoke 'n 
mirrors of HTTP headers.

I appreciate any thoughts on this.

Scott,

After processing the form, you can redirect (header('Location: page.php');
exit;) to another page that has some 'Form has been processed' message. If
the user hits refresh, he/she won't be resubmitting the form.

Daniel Kushner

If you would wish to have the page show the origional form with a success variable - then you could have the mail sent, and header back to itself with a get variable, say header("location: ".$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']."?success=true"); or success = false, which then the form page would check to see if the variable exists, and display a message:

if (!empty($_GET['success']))
{
  if ($_GET['success'] == "true")
  {
    print("Your mail has been sent");
  }
  else
  {
    print("Your mail was not sent.");
  }
}

hope that helps any.

You mean...
  header('Location: http://domain/path/page.php');

While the shorthand usually works, it's not guaranteed to do so.

Yep (from w3):
The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to a
location other than the Request-URI for completion of the request or
identification of a new resource. For 201 (Created) responses, the Location
is that of the new resource which was created by the request. For 3xx
responses, the location SHOULD indicate the server's preferred URI for
automatic redirection to the resource. The field value consists of a single
absolute URI.

       Location       = "Location" ":" absoluteURI

An example is:

       Location: http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/People.html

http://tool.motoricerca.info/robots-checker.phtml to check the syntax. I 
can't speak about the code...but if were trying to do this I'd look 
inside some of the weblogs to see what the googlebot looks like in terms 
  of the user agent.

That will be returned as a 302, and word is that G likes 301s better than
302s.

So you might benefit from adding

header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently");

before the Location header.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] prevention of csrf attack
Message-ID: <20031221220601.6d01d53f.felix@students.poly.edu>


I recently read chris shiflett article on csrf attack in phparchetect and it got me thinking about prevention techinques. 

Chris refered to as  shared secret with a token that is stored in hidden field. I dont quite consider it to be shared secret but in any case there is easy way to get around it. 

-Attacker would first request a form on his own and receive a token.
-Then attacket will trick a user to use his form with the token that is retrived by himself earlier. 
-Attacker can retrive a valid token right before presenting fake form to user, so timeout of token wont prevent much.

I been thinking of a better solution but so far i have not come up with a perfect one but here is one i came up so far.

Every page will have a hidden token sent to it by server which can be put in a hidden filed.  It would be created something like this : 
$token= md5(SID . $server_secret . $randome_num);
echo "<input type="hidden" ... $token  >"
echo "<input type="hidden" ... $random_num >"

Client Browser then can use javascript to construct a authenication code for each url.
location.href= url + '?rn='+random_num +'&auc=' + md5(token+url+cookie_sid());

Server can easily verify auc but one cannot be calculated by anyone other then the server. Attacker can do a replay if he can get the urls of user from http logs. The attacker cannot though do a replay without knowing the sid of the user. So I think the csrf on its own is prevented. If its combined with xss or looking at logs then its cant prevent but still makes it more difficult.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] php5 classes & financial aid
Message-ID: <003e01c3c843$49003420$0300a8c0@acepc>

I would like to know about any financial aid that may be offered for the NY-PHP courses. 
I am currently unemployed/self employed, trying to make any possible living as a php developer, systems administrator, and network administrator. 
I've been working with pup for about 6 years and have developed many applications, websites, and scripts, including several GEL projects. 
I am looking to learn more about PHP5 and OOP so that I can become a more valuable php developer, hopefully resulting in a permanent position somewhere. 
I also plan to develop a large class library and an interface for that library, to ease php development for beginner developers 
(the sourceforge project & .com are already in place). 

I am far beyond basic concepts and have learned a great deal from the web and free sources. 
However, I would like to have some legitimate php training on my resume to justify the skills that I list. 
If anyone knows of any grants, scholarships, or other funds available to lower working class, low income persons, please send me information. 
I would love to have the opportunity to expand my skills, and be ahead of the php5 oop revolution and become a much needed asset in the marketplace.

This is a weakness that I purposely include in my talks, but I don't think
the article had such a weakness. I only include it in the talk to help
drive home the fact that every implementation can be strengthened, and it
gives me a question to ask to see whether anyone is paying attention. :-)

At any rate, this particular weakness is easily resolved by making the
token only shared between the server and the legitimate user (rather than
just keeping a pool of valid tokens). By storing this value in the user's
session, it requires that the attacker guess that user's specific token.

Hope that helps.

Chris

That only complicates things a little because now the attacker has to retrive the secret token using the session id of the user. So the first fake request has to be to request the form page grabe the token and then resubmit second fake request with the token.

So I come to the conclusion that my method can work if its make generic and that EVERY request in the session needs to have the second token with the session id. This way the attacker would not get a change to perform the first fake request in order to grab a token at no time.  I think i am going to write an implementation of this.

Thanks for suggestions re: refreshing a form page that's been processed.
I was trying to avoid redirecting to another page after submitting the form and 
would prefer to process through action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>"

The end-user usability is most effective if they can:
* submit the request form
* have the data processed
* and have the form reload...so they can submit another request if necessary.

I may have no choice but to do it in 2 steps. 1)submit and redirect to 
acknowledgement page; 2)and then redirect/link back to clean form.

I'm still curious about what causes the browser to resubmit the form data if 
you refresh the form page after submitting. Can't you flush the previous header 
info. I've tried resetting the form variables... and even changing HTTP status.

If anyone knows of any concise HTTP header references/explanations, I'd 
appreciate the guidance.

Thanks again for suggestions.
Regards and happy holidays!

Message-ID: <688BD1502D7CA547800722B3501F62BB3F5338@ms03.mailstreet2003.net>


Good morning,

I'm using list()  (http://us4.php.net/list) to put the values from a
mysql_fetch_row() call into separate variables - yes, it's trivial.

However, I need some the elements to be casted to ints.  I'm aware of
the various workarounds, but what I'd really like to do is:

list( (int) $id,$name, (int) $somenumber) = mysql_fetch_row($result);

Of course, this throws a parse error.  Is anyone aware of any clever
tricks that keeps a nearly identical syntax?  Or, maybe this could be a
feature request (although it won't do me any good today :)  What I'm
doing now is:

list($id,$name,$somenumber) = mysql_fetch_row($result);

$id = (int) $id;
$somenumber = (int) $somenumber;


But I just don't like that, especially with tons of columns from the DB,
big loops, etc...

Thanks,

H

I'm using preg_match to verify form data. I'm not sure how to handle 
accented characters, e.g., an "e" with an accent as in Mazda Proteg?. 
Obviously the following pattern ( '/^[a-z0-9()\/\'"|&,. -]{2,55}$/i' )

How about defining an array at the top of all the variables you want to 
cast as an integer

$intVars = array('id', 'somenumber');

then a simple

ist($id,$name,$somenumber) = mysql_fetch_row($result);
foreach ($inVars as $iv) $$iv = (int) $$iv ;

should do the trick..

or you could make two SQL calls, one for things you want to be integers 
and the other for everything else, followed by an array_map casting the 
contents of the integer-only call (returned as an associative array, 
mind you) to int.

$intVars = mysql_fetch_row($resultIntOnly);
$intVars = array_map('cast2int',$intVars);
foreach ($intVars as $intVarName => $intVarValue) $$intVarName = (int) 
$intVarValue ;

list($name) = mysql_fetch_row($resultEverythingElse);

But I'm sure there are ways you can get really crazy:

$allVars = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
foreach ($allVars as $allVarName => $allVarValue)
	if (is_numeric($allVarValue) and (intval($allVarValue) == 
$allVarValue)) {
		$$allVarName = (int) $allVarValue ;
	} else {
		$$allVarName = $allVarValue ;
}

providing you with the opportunity to really obfuscate your code with

$row = mysql_fetch_row($result);
foreach ($row as $key => $value) $$key = (is_numeric($value) and 
(intval($value) == $value))?(int) $value:$value;

That should get the legibility fairies panties in a knot!

Though it doesn't really answer how to check for them, you might be better
off using a negative search pattern... looks like there's more characters
you DON'T want than things you DO want, anyway.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Form field length vs. Database field length
Message-ID: <3FE7380F.9010305@netzero.com>

Hello,

We are having some trouble with submitting user data into the database. 
  We have a database with a set field length and we want to be able to 
store user information such as name and address.  We have checks in 
place to prevent users from submitting a 50 charachter string when the 
db only accepts 30, but we run into problems when they submit special 
characters.  We want to avoid xss so we call htmlspecialchars() on any 
data before we insert it into the database.  But if the field takes 10 
charachters and a user submits 'Scott & Ed' their info won't get put 
into the db becuase the string gets turned into 'Scott &amp; Ed' which 
is too long.

Choping off the charachters after the limit will leave you with some 
strange results, not to mention the wrong data.  We could extend all of 
the field lengths this seems like a waste of space and poor practice. 
Adding 4 chars of space is no big deal but what if the user entered 10 
&'s?  Then we have to make the field 5 times as big as we are going to 
need for 99.9% of the data.  Asking the user to change the input data 
won't work because as far as they know, 'Scott & Ed' fits within the 
length requirements for that field.

Does anyone have any tips or tricks for this type of problem?

Thanks in advance,
Scott Mattocks

& was just my example character but replacing characters makes for 
incorrect data.  For instance 'Bob & Joe's Towing' is different from 
'Bob and Joe's Towing' and 'Bob + Joe's Towing'.  We want the data to be 
as accurate as possible.  It is a sublte distinction but if Bob and Joe 
want to use & in their company name then we shouldn't change it.

Ehh, negative on the two SQL calls.  I do have a function that attempts
to do this type of thing.  It's a type-sensitive mysql_fetch_row()
(which is really what I'd like):

http://pcomd.net/mysql_get_row

but it's a little heavy and annoying in some ways.  Alas, the yin-yang
of a type-less language.

Thanks Jeff - that array up top might be a nice maintainable way to
workaround this so that future generations can read the code :)

FYI, I wanted to see how the "big guys" handled this, so I went to the

vice versa.

It hasn't come up for me, but I would probably do the same if it did.

The best bet might be to use egress htmlspecialchars() calls.  That is
to say, only call htmlspecialchars() when you're about to display the
data, rather than before storing it.  HTML entities won't have any
negative effect on SQL statements (but yeah, use
mysql_real_escape_string() or similar).

That is probably what we will end up doing, but I don't like it.  I 
would rather only mess with the data when it is submitted but it doesn't 
seem like that is going to be possible.

I hear that, although see it differently.  The type of data messing you
speak of is a display issue that's not related to the data itself.  If
data accuracey is important, as it generally is, and is in this case,
you wouldn't want to store transformed data, i.e., it's impossible to
ever know what the original data was.  Just different ways of looking at
it.

Hans's suggesting is definitely the way to go. You should store data in the
database in as unmodified a form as possible (Just like you mentioned that
you don't want to arbitrarily replace &'s with +'s in busines names).

The encoding is entirely display dependant -- when you pull data out of the
database and you need to display it safely as HTML, call htmlspecialchars().
When you pull data out of the database and you want to use it as plain text
(in an internal report or e-mail message), don't do anything to it. When you
pull data out of the database and you want to generate a CSV file, you do
the CSV encoding transformations with commas and quotes and whatnot. But in
the database, the data should not be pre-modified to accomodate any
particular display encoding scheme.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL is very smart - but why does this work?
Message-ID: <3FE757ED.6080203@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I discovered the following accidentally, and it does what I want. The 
thing is, I would not expect MySQL to behave in this way.

I have a table called "archives". The archives table has a column called 
"genre_match", which contains either a single number, or a comma 
separated list of numbers.

If run the following query:

SELECT * FROM archives WHERE genre_match = 2

it selects the rows whose genre_match column has the following info
- 2
- 2, 34, 96
- 14, 2, 25

but it does not select the rows whose genre_match column contains the 
following info
- 12
- 22
- 32, 45, 19

If I put quotes around the 2, it does not work. I.E:
SELECT * FROM archives WHERE genre_match = '2'

I am unbelievably pleased with the result, but I am wondering why MySQL 
behaves in such a (clever) way.

I was trying to do this with LIKE, but that was not working. (And ideas 
on dong the same thing with LIKE would be greatly appreciated).

In case anyone is interested, I ended up just revising the above PCOM to
be more robust.  After the revision, I dropped the function into our
development intranet site and it's running smoothly without any
performance change - of course, it is an intranet :)  The actual
castings done by mysql_get_row() are documented in the source - it's
just a type cast mysql_fetch_row().

Hans,

Assuming that this code will be executed on every (or most) database
queries, it would be much more efficient to use a switch statement instead
of all those else/if's.
There should also optimally be a catch all, just incase all if's are false.

I was on the fence about this, too.  From what I've
heard/read/understood, switch statements become more efficient than
if/else when there are about 4 or more test cases (switch statements
have a considerable overhead to setup).  This is from C, so frankly I
don't know if it holds true under PHP, too.  I'd be interested to see
both cases run through some profiler and I'll change the PCOM
accordingly :)

The catch all is implied.  If the type isn't known, the type should be a
string, which is what mysql_fetch_row() itself always returns - so no
need to do any casting.

Could you send me some stand-alone code (2 versions) that I could abuse in
the Zend Profiler?

IMHO PCOM would be more robust the less it relies on other API's. But I
guess that the chances of mysql_fetch_row() changing it's behavior is very
remote.

I think I'm probably gonna miss the 2003-12-23 meeting -- I mention this
just because it was I who was publicly asking you for a spiel on pAuth, so

Message-ID: <000501c3c92b$cf9a2bb0$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

since i had no luck w/ the previous 2 betas i tried the 3rd ...

it seems to be working smoothly although i have one small install question
... there is no more built in mysql anymore so i enabled php_mysql.dll but
what/or how do you enable libmysql.dll?  is it needed or is it for mysqli
stuff (mysql > 4.1)

i had really been hoping there would be an easier way to run php4/5 side by
side and use .php5 files for testing (btw im extremely happy that much of my
work was backward compatible) ... @ the moment i have a small script
renaming php4ts.dll back and forth - in case of anything ... anyone else
have solutions?  i would have been nice to have php5ts.dll + LoadModule
php5_module c:\php5\sapi\php5apache2.dll

one thing i noticed is that my apache logs got completely filled up w/ php
notices on exceptions (i normally handle error handling page by page, but
not normally on an included definition page - so i end up w/something like:
PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant FOO - assumed 'FOO') - normal?

I been wanting to give php5 a try also. So I will experiment also. 
I think its a good idea to have php5 work with .php5 files. Its possible to configure apache to do this. I can let you know once i get it done for myself.
 
It may be possilbe to direct all the Error stuff from php to a different log file i have to look into that.

To be honest, I'm not sure why that works - but I wouldn't rely on it.
My initial guess is that some esoteric cast behavior is surfacing, since
that behavior is undocumented AFAIK.  I'd recommend doing it The Right
Way (tm).

No problem - thanks for the note.  I think I'll be doing a brief talk on
pAuth anyway since a couple others have expressed interest in hearing
about it.

I agree. It looks like the server is casting it to the 'set' type. I would
play with that, since it's looking like that kind of behavior is what you
want. Like Hans said, don't rely on undocumented behaviour.

One of the best free ones out there is 'Request Tracker'. Not php,
but great stuff anyway.

it seems that it is the 'normal' way to insert data using a set if the

I'm using PerlDesk ( http://www.perldesk.com ). It is perl, and not free
anymore. I got a license as compensation for some work I did for a client.

The best one to date is Desk Pro by www.deskpro.com , php/mysql. They just
released version 2, and it looks overwhelmingly fantastic. It is $795. You
get full source which you can customize for your own need. My employer has
been using 1.1 for over 2 years. They have modified it so much that it isn't
possible for them to upgrade to version 2.

a pretty good read ...

the report itself can be downloaded @

reasoning seems to do pretty good audits, does php itself go to
third-parties like that?  i just like the fact that a company would not turn

just fix the problems, i find alot of open coded projects can benefit like

Well, now you're combining attacks and making a very big assumption: that
the session management mechanism is weak. If someone can impersonate the
legitimate user, a CSRF attack is not even necessary, so no intelligent
attacker is going to bother trying after that point. CSRF attacks are
generally only useful when impersonation is more difficult.

To clarify this, recall that CSRF attacks are basically a way to trick the
legitimate user into sending a request of your choosing. If you can make
the application believe that you are the legitimate user, there is no
longer any need for CSRF, because you can now do whatever you want, and
the application will mistake your identity.

I recently wrote an article about session security in PHP Magazine that
you can download for free from http://www.phpmag.net/ssl/phppdf/.

Hope that helps.

You can add acceptable foreign character ranges in there.  Putting the 
following in would allow all foreign chars:  ?-??-??-?

But, that may not come through nicely via email.  So, assuming a character 
set of ISO-8859-1:
   ORDINAL: 192-214 216-246 248-255
   HEX:     c0-d6   d8-f6   f8-ff
   OCTAL:   300-326 330-366 370-377

All of these provide coverage for case sensitive matches, so is overkill
for the case insensitive pattern you proposed, but this isn't a big deal.

You can also put the hex representations in preg using \xhh syntax (so 
"\xc0" for example) and octals in via \ddd syntax (ie: "\300").

Enjoy,

There's a program in NY that's sponsored by the City and State - I think 
the org is called the Workers Consortium, or something like that. They 
offer money for classes to make you employable. The classes have to be 
on an approved list of some sort though, so someone at NYPHP would have 
to check into getting that done.

And what if some charming individual on staff (or whatever) that has 
direct access to the database decides to (maliciously?) update data 
directly?

In short, data needs to be cleaned up before being displayed.

MySQL is in the windows builds.  Just go into php.ini and remove the ";"

Guess your error reporting settings (either in the scripts or in php.ini) 
are different.

Anyway, notices are good to know about.  You really should address them.  
So, set error reporting to E_ALL.

i noticed this project just recently:

basically a wrapper using mysql w/  CREATE FUNCTION foo RETURNS STRING
SONAME "foo.so"; to run Java natively ... so you could do this:

mysql> SELECT foo("classes/MyClasss", COLUMN1, COLUMN2) FROM foobar;

i wonder what the major advantages of this really are or if its overkill, im
assuming the same thing could be done w/ php ... but beyond filtering what
would it be good for?

Amen to that,

I just finished an email to Jeff on this very subject, should be 
appearing in a PHundamental very soon.

Essentially though, htmlentities or any other type of content encoding 
should be done when text is output to whatever format it is being output to.

If you decided in the future sometime to output your data in pdf, you 
would have to go through and unhtmlentities (html_entity_decode) 
everything, no fun.

Actually there is a UDF which can execute PHP code already.  Written by 
David Sklar, you can find it here:

<http://www.sklar.com/page/article/myphp>

As for usefulness, it could be very handy if you wanted to for instance 
implement partial order nested sets:

<http://www.dbazine.com/tropashko4.html>

There are plenty of situations where the ability to execute php code 
could be a Good Thing, though for most cases the same results can be 
achieved with SQL-99 stored procedures, which are supported in MySQL 5.x 
and much more portable than embedded php code.

Wow, thanks Dan! An excellent Boxing Day gift to those of us without 
Oracle. :-)

I'm just beginning to wrap my head around the Nested Set approach, 
having always used a Materialized Path. It's always nice to find that 
there's more than one way to do it.

The clew project (NYPHP's new mailing list / forum) uses a Celko-style 
Nested Set to store the message heirarchy, courtesy of Hans Zaunere's 
pNSM class. Once we work through the implementation and have it up and 
running, it would be a great idea to take a shot at the Partial Order 
approach spelled out by Tropashko, using myphp to do the math.

Yeah, I've seen a little of the clew discussion, I'm kinda new to the 
whole nyphp thing so I'm a little behind.

Why did you decide on Nested Sets?  I have had good success in the past 
with Modified Preorder Traversal Trees in MySQL and Postgres, basically 
a mixture of Nested Sets and adjacency tables, with the advantages (and 
disadvantages) of both.  They seem to be to be a little more robust than 
vanilla nested sets, as well as giving you more options for retrieving data.

For a sample implementation see phpGACL, we haven't released a version 
using the new trees yet, but everything is in CVS and undergoing final 
testing prior to release.

I also have an implementation of all the functions required for 
Tropashko's Partial Order Nested Sets in PHP, might have to have a play 
with those when I get some free time.

I am not so certain a PHP function will bring more to the table than 
a udf written in C. I hesitate to say anything because unlike you  
("... wrap[ing] my head around the Nested Set approach...")  
I am rapping my head against the nested set model.

Great post!

It is the embodiment of a 'gestalt' in that it puts two things  
together in such a way as to form something (usually an idea) 
which is greater than the sum of its parts.

A 'gestalt' tends to make you want to say 'Aha'...

I certainly exclaimed just that after reading 
your post...

You have an XSLT stylesheet. You want to translate an XML document. As
part of the transformation you want to call some PHP function to grab
text out of a database, format code, return a DOM object, etc.

I haven't gotten around to writing up a nice description of this, but
if you've got the tarball check out ext/xsl/xslt011.* for
examples. It's pretty neat.

I actually don't remember what this is.

I'm finishing up the article on php.ini settings to which many of you have 
contributed over the past month and a half, and I need a bit more help on 
this one issue.

There seems to be a consensus that the three magic_quotes settings should 
be off except in certain very limited circumstances.
1.  is this accurate?
2.  what are (examples of) those very limited circumstances?

You call this is a "very limited circumstance"?

Seriously though, folks.... it raises the question why does PHP have this
feature[?] at all? Maybe it's in the same bag as register_globals --
i.e., seemed like a good idea at the time.

I don't know of movement to deprecate the 'magic' stuff.

magic quotes provides another way to 'skin the cat' --
i.e. it is a non-orthogonal language feature.

Orthogonality comes from the mathematic property of some arrays.
"Of or relating to a matrix whose transpose equals its inverse"
http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=orthogonal


Harry Fuecks suggests:
That if you never use stripslashes you can avoid doing things 
the 'six way' in places and the 'half a dozen way' in others.
(at least that's my interpetation)

Yes, I see he says "In retrospect, the PHP crew probably wish they'd never
provided magic_quotes..."

I *seem* to remember at one point there was an audit in process from a

Exactly.   :)

Not to beat a dead horse, but I think a lot of PHP's "convenience"
settings (like register_globals, magic_this and magic_that) fall into
the "it seemed like a good idea at the time" department.  For the most
part, the php.ini-recommended is the way to go -

indeed it would benefit the selling point of using open source in the

... i also wish the same principles would then afterwards be applied to open

I seem to remember seeing something on Slashdot about an audit of Apache
2.something where they found it had substantially more... what do they
call them?  D/KLSC (for Defects per Thousand Lines of Source Code)? ...
than Apache 1.3.something. Then came the musings and speculation:  you
know how we anthropomorphize software all the time (it 'complains',
'dies', you 'kill' a process, it 'thinks' this or 'doesn't care' about
that...). Well perhaps the life cycle metaphor is more apt than we
thought. Could it be that software -- even the venerable Apache httpd --
eventually gets old and starts losing its teeth, libido,.etc.?

I'd say the majority of them will be published in 2004. I know of at least
two right now: one from O'Reilly and one from Sams. There are four
NYPHPers involved in the O'Reilly one.

I like this idea and I am highly amused by the comic fodder it provides.
In particular in regards to MS products.

Take, for one example, Outlook and it's battle with viagra (read spam)..

I'd bet money that the PHP 5 book will be out before mine. :-)

Depending on the complexity and scope of the project, the differences
are generally minimal from what I've seen.  The big one is permissions -
CGI scripts can be run as their owner/group, rather than that of Apache
itself.

Another thing to consider is that each request to a CGI script is it's
own process, which then exits when finished.  This probably isn't hugely
important in most cases, but something to keep in mind.  Also, Apache
specific functions (http://php.net/apache) aren't available.  Lastly, if
the script works on the command line, it'll generally work as a CGI
(since the CGI/CLI versions of PHP are closely related, vs the Apache
SAPI).

In addition to the books that Chris mentioned, Learning PHP
(O'Reilly) will cover PHP 5. It will be available probably in May or
June. There is also some PHP 5 stuff (a chapter on SimpleXML, highlights
of PHP5 features and compatibility of other modules and accelerators) in
Essential PHP Tools (Apress) which will be out in March.

Hans,

Thanks for the info. For the most part, it seems there isn't too much to 
be concerned about (I won't be using any of the Apache specific functions).

What about setting my own php.ini file? I'd like to turn off 
magic_quotes and register_globals (and probably a few other things). 
Should I just code around this or can I safely overwrite the php.ini 
file that is in cgi-bin?

Jeff
P.S. The interesting thing, when I try to view the php.ini file that is 
in cgi-bin, I only see a few settings.
