Guys & Gals,

i am looking for an in depth explanation and example based OOP tutorial,

at this time i have been learning OOP in PHP and mostly been using them
as collections rather than objects i mean i do $user->login and have it
authorize the user and then check $user->isAuth() to see if they are
authorized but i believe the point to objects is more than that, and i
would like to forward my knowledge in OOP and use it correctly.

You might find some of the articles at:

to be of interest. 
(They are not really tutorials per se) 

I recommend:

by Robert Martin -- (c)2000.

here's an excerpt: 

"Of all the principles of object oriented design, 
this is the most important. It originated from the 
work of Bertrand Meyer. It means simply this: 
We should write our modules so that they can be extended, 
without requiring them to be modified. In other
words, we want to be able to change what the modules do, 
without changing the source code of the modules."

Message-ID: <410D540F.80700@spacemonkeylabs.com>

Hey list,

I'm experimenting with PEAR::DB's nextID method and PostgreSQL 7.4.  
Everything appears to be on the up-and-up, but I keep getting stale 
numbers from nextID when called.  Just to catch the problem, I wrote an 
echo to show what DB thinks the next number is in the sequence, and it 
prints out:

   UPDATE content SET content_archive_id = 18 WHERE id = 4

...but pgsql tells me the latest id in the table is 20?!?!

Any ideas on how to debug this?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SQL question - summary data for two categories
Message-ID: <949FCF24-E475-11D8-B366-000A95DB7EF2@optonline.net>

I have a primary data table that holds the same type of results for two 
different categories. There is a column in the table that reflects the 
category for each row.

Up to this point, I have been creating two separate summary tables, one 
for each category. Is it possible to combine them in one 
CREATE...SELECT construct? I would add a suffix to the column names to 
distinguish which category the data came from.

The sql below generates the summary data for the category where species 
= 'human'.  Can I do the same for an additional species and put 
everything into one summary table?

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS primary_dr_hum_summ;
CREATE TABLE primary_dr_hum_summ
SELECT id, ROUND(avg(IC50), 4) AS avg_IC50, COUNT(IC50) as count,
   ROUND(MIN(IC50), 4) AS min_IC50, ROUND(MAX(IC50), 4) AS max_IC50,
   ROUND(STD(IC50), 4) AS std_dev, ROUND(max(IC50)/min(IC50)) as ratio
FROM primary_dr
WHERE species = "human"
GROUP BY id ORDER BY avg_IC50;
ALTER TABLE primary_dr_hum_summ ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);

Examples I've seen using Pear Auth normally require the Auth module and 
pass an array of options including database name,type host etc.

In practice are most users wrapping this into a class of its own and 
including that all pages.

I mean to say that you wouldn't want to edit all db backed pages if the 
db host changed right? I can handle abstracting it out. Just wanted to 
verify that's the case here.

That's odd.  I'm running 7.4.1 and everything is fine on my tests.  
Can you please run the 05sequences.phpt test?  It's located in 
<pear>/tests/DB/tests/driver or there about depending on your 
installation.

Instructions are here: http://cvs.php.net/co.php/pear/DB/doc/TESTERS

I trust you've broken down your problem into a simple test script.  If 
so, email it to me and I'll check it out.

Ouch.  Glad you've seen the light of merging them into one table.

Not really, that I know of.  For ease of long term maintenance, 
comprehension and accuracy in choosing column types, do your self a 
favor: make one file that just has a CREATE TABLE statement.  Don't 
have it do a create select.

Then create separate SELECT INTO statements to move the data from the 
different tables into the new centralized table.

Hey Dan,

Congrats for making it to the International PHP Conference final 40!  I 
wager with all of the submissions they limited most everything to 
PHP-specific stuff, as the HORDE gang didn't make it in either.  Good 
job, you are definitely one of the elite!  :-)  As for me and my two 
submissions, well, erm, *cough*

Spent some time on this, but on a RH7.3 box with PHP handmade it was not 
possible for me to figure out.  None of the test stuff was installed 
(and was still hanging around in the source directory trees), and the 
php executable was nowhere near the source directories either, for 
obvious reasons ;-)

Here is the function that does the update, and should be easy to understand:

    function processForm(){
        // get the next sequence id for content_archives
        $id = $this->db->nextId( 'content_archives_id_seq' );
        if (DB::isError($id)) {
            die($id->getMessage());
        }
        // build insert SQL
        $sql = 'INSERT INTO content_archives (content_id, created, 
title, content_data, staff_id) VALUES (' .
            $_POST['content_id'] . ', now(), ' . $this->db->quoteSmart( 
$_POST['title'] ) . ', ' .
            $this->db->quoteSmart( $_POST['content'] ) . ', ' . 
$_POST['staff_id'] . ')';
        $res = $this->db->query( $sql );
        if (DB::isError($res)) {
            die($res->getMessage());
        }
        // update content to point to new content_archives.id
        $sql = 'UPDATE content SET content_archive_id = ' . $id . ' 
WHERE id = ' . $_POST['content_id'];
        $res = $this->db->query( $sql );
        if (DB::isError($res)) {
            die($res->getMessage());
        }
        echo "<p>Content update successful!</p>\n";
    } // ends function processForm

Whenever this function is called, the last insert gets an older id from 
the content_archives_id_seq sequence, most definitely not current.  As 
this is new code that is only accessable on a development site, I am the 
only person running it at present - so there's no possibility of the 
sequence getting incremented while the process is underway.

What do you think?  Am I not using nextID() properly here?  Am I missing 
a commit that needs to happen first?

Thanks!  I'm looking forward to the trip and meeting many of the 
people I just know via email and IRC.

Before I get into testing things out, did you create the sequence 
manually somewhere else using createSequence()?  If so, are you using 
the same exact name, including your unnecessarily appending "_seq" to 
the name as you are here:

>        $id = $this->db->nextId( 'content_archives_id_seq' );

Similarly, do all calls to nextID() use the same exact name?  You see, 
"_seq" is automatically appended to any name you pass to any of the 
sequence methods.  So, if you call it with "_seq" the name will be 
"_seq_seq".

If neither of those situations are the problem, please be so kind as 
to send along a self contained test script that both creates and drops 
the test table plus passes values into the query.

What I have done is require an 'auth.php' on each page that, well,
requires it. auth.php in turn loads Auth.php and instantiates an Auth,
passing among other things 'dsn'=>DSN in the $options array, where DSN is
a constant defined elsewhere. Worksforme. For even less work, you might
consider doing this by setting a auto_prepend_file directive in an
.htaccess file in the directory in question.

The sequence was created automagically by PostgreSQL at table creation 
time, thanks to the SERIAL column type.  I used PGAdminIII to get the 
exact name of the sequence, which is content_archives_id_seq.

>Similarly, do all calls to nextID() use the same exact name?  You see,

So are you saying that nextID() appends the string "_seq" to the 
sequence name?

Okay, first will experiment with the sequence names and check that 
things are on the up and up.  If after that I still have trouble I'll 
write something up that you can see.

Attached is the test script, looks a little nonsensical now that I 
understand how nextID() works.  Here was the misunderstanding, and 
hopefully you could add something to the docs to clarify?

nextID() grabs the next value from the sequence, AND THEN INCREMENTS 
THAT SEQUENCE.  So you cannot get a value from nextID() and then do an 
insert without specifying that value for the column that the sequence is 
used for.

I created a table that only had two columns, id and sequence_value.  I 
then got the latest sequence value with nextID, and inserted a new row 
like this:

    "INSERT INTO test ( sequence_value ) VALUES ( $id )";

Of course I was not thinking that I needed to use $ID for the first 
column in the table as well, and got two different values on the 
insert.  Basically row 2 got an id of 1, row 4 got an id of 3, and so 
on.  I corrected the SQL to:

    "INSERT INTO test ( id, sequence_value ) VALUES ( $id, $id )";

And of course everything syncs up properly.  The sequence is also now 
happy, as it isn't being used twice for each row.  Providing an example 
in the docs would be a time saver and avoid unnecessary forehead 
slapping.  ;-)

A couple thoughts off the top of my head... I think the behavior may 
vary between DBMS's.  Also, all the system is meant to do is provide a 
unique number, not necessarily a specific number, so it doesn't really 
matter what the number is.

A quick look at your test script shows you're using the PostgreSQL's 
native serial (which is like auto_increment to you MySQL'ers out 
there) and PEAR DB's sequence data.  Use one or the other.  Using both 
leads to the problems you're seeing, let alone, the duplication of 
information.

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-sequences.php 
has an example.  Are you saying it's too terse / not real-world 
enough?

It does if you are trying to keep that number synced with a sequence LOL

Also, do you know if the other relational databases do that too (DB2, 
Oracle, etc.), or is this a PostgreSQL only thing?

As long as you are aware that nextID() will increment the sequence, you 
are golden.  This is what confused me, and when I was writing the test 
script it dawned on me what was going on.  I'm not using PEAR DB's 
sequence data, but using DB's nextID() to get the current value from the 
sequence in a PostgreSQL database.  I've tested it thoroughly enough to 
feel confident that this is expected/consistent behaviour (at least on 
PostgreSQL).

Nope, I love the documentation you have been providing :-) Just would 
really like a note for PostgreSQL folks out there that if they want to 
use nextID() to deal with existing sequences, they will need to omit the 
'_seq' from the sequence name and also use that number for the SERIAL 
column if they are issuing DML on that column.  Maybe a two table 
example where you use the newly created SERIAL column in one table to 
update rows in another?  I'll supply the text if you want.

Or do I ask too much?  :-)

I thought so,. I'm just super frugal when it comes to requires and 
includes, so I just wanted to check.

I code on OSX and use a $20 program called skEdit. http://www.skti.org

html, css, php code completion. very light, simple and fast.  free demo

Hey gang,
I've tried unsuccessfully to make this happen but I haven't got any more
time to tinker exhaustively on it so...

Anyone have a method for getting a multidimensional array passed on the
query string using GET?

For now I'm just going to go back to multiple arrays and process them "the
hard way".

Interesting...

maybe serialize()? http://us2.php.net/serialize

You *can* do it, just use the xxx[][] syntax, like:

http://www.example.com/index.php?test[1][hello]=tiger&test[1][test]=testing&test[2][]=a&test[2][]=test

would become:

$_GET['test'] = array (
	'1' => array (
		'hello' => 'tiger',
		'test' => 'testing'
	),
	'2' => array (
		'a',
		'test'
	)
);

Technically the [] syntax shouldn't be used, but it in the real world it 
works and can save a lot of headaches.

Since I'm using PHP4, I don't have the oh-so-snazzy build_query_string(),
but for academia's sake, what does *it* do when handed a multi-dim array?

Honestly, serialize is your best bet here.
You can also compress it if need be.

The nice thing about serializing is that, when you unserialize it, 
you'll immediately know if someone mucked with the URL string, i.e.,

if (!unserialize([$_GET['mystuff'])) echo 'Hey...don't mess with that 
string!!';

BBEdit seems to have taken over since I'm now developing on OS X. I am, 
however, surprised only one person mentioned Emacs. Times sure have 
changed. Or maybe that never caught fire with the PHP crowd.

I haven't really paid attention to which DBMS's do what.  I just know that 
it works.  I'm out of town, so can't research it for you further at this 
time.

Ah.  I'm not sure what in the docs gave you that impression, but I do 
realize that there is nothing in the docs clearly indicating exactly how 
it DOES work.  Before I left, I updated the warning text in the notes 
section of the intro.  See the new text at
http://www.appelsiini.net/~tuupola/php/peardoc2/package.database.db.intro-sequences.html
Also put a link to it on all of the sequence methods's pages.

I'll try to further clarify how things work when I get back.

Perhaps this is me remembering things from long ago (probably in 
different environments even), and they have since all evolved... But I 
do vaguely remember when you fetched the current value of a sequence, 
some databases automatically incremented the value while others did not; 
and this had to do with some databases allowing you to get the current 
value of a sequence without issuing any DML, and others would 
automatically increment just by you fetching the current value.  *shrug*

BTW there was nothing in your docs that led me astray, I had assumed 
that before a COMMIT or DML statement you would have the same value in 
the sequence.  Again, this may be historical influences, and therefore 
irrelevant ;-)

I like this a lot, but wonder why you wouldn't try to use the sequences 
that were already in the database?  If I had a PostgreSQL database that 
had a PHP website and wxPython client, then the sequence would obviously 
belong in the database; and having PHP keep it's own 'PHP-only' sequence 
alongside the existing one is not a logical choice, no?

Or were there other technical issues that forced you to go with the 
"%s_seq" route?

Regardless, have safe travels and thanks for IMHO PEAR's greatest 
asset!  ;-)

Hi list,

I'm looking at one particularly big script that I would like to prune to 
several includes, but wondering what performance issues would arise...

Basically I have one script that has become the 'controller' for the 
rest of the side (thanks to mod_rewrite), and I want to prune this 
initial file down so it is not such a big beast.  However I fear that 
performance could suffer as a result.

Any opinions on tackling such a problem?

Performance will be worse. How worse is open to discussion. It will be
better on Linux than FreeBSD, at least from what I've read from Rasmus
w/r/t Yahoo! Depending on load, it may be barely noticeable,
particularly if you have well-designed include paths.

You could easily mimic performance by adding in a few empty includes
and benchmarking it. That'll let you test the performance hit without
bothering to refactor the code.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] email quota hander in PHP
Message-ID: <018401c47be9$8c970380$6401a8c0@iifwp.local>

Hi Folks,

Anybody here want to try and talk me out of writing a PHP script to help me
trim down over-quota mailboxes on my server?  Somehow I pick up the
impression from some people that PHP is just not meant for this kind of
thing, and that I'd be better off going with python or perl.  Since I'm much
more familiar with PHP than most anything else, that seems a lot more
convenient.

The background is that I've been looking for some ways to manage email
quotas per user on my server, something that's a little more flexible than
procmail's "bounce anything over-quota" methods.  Not having found anything
existing, I've started to hack something together in PHP that would get
called daily by cron and then implement a certain policy on over-quota mbox
files  (basically, delete oldest messages one-by-one until mbox size is
acceptable, but never delete anything less than x days old).  I've also got
access to something in Python which I could (extensively) modify -- but I
don't look forward to that.

Anybody in NYPHP-land want to issue a word of warning before I go this way?

Thanks,
Allen

Mitch:

To expand upon what Adam said, include performance is better when...

Your include_path leads directly to the files in question or you include 
using a full path.

The files are at the root of the file system or as close to there as 
possible.

Steps have been, and will be, taken to improve the Zend engine's 
performance when doing includes.  They should be appearing in future 
releases.

I for one think code readability and organization are more important than
shaving one ten-thousandth of a second off your load time. Any compiled at
run-time language served over a network is going to have variable serve
times, the margin of which, is probably greater than the server load
incurred by an include statement.

Optimization and performance are important. And profiling is a necessity,
especially for spotting sluggish parts of an app. But I think people can
become overly consumed with performance.

Your best bet for performance might be to first look at code architecture.
And according to "extreme programming" you should profile first before
optimizing. See if it actually is those pesky "includes" or maybe a poorly
written function that's used 1,000 times during execution of your script.

I hope this doesn't sound persnickety, but if we start worrying about using
"includes" we'll never be able to write any serious PHP programs.

Ugh, this "broadband" wireless is wretchedly slow.  The lag time between 
keyboard input and reponse makes me feel like I'm using a 2400 baud modem.

So, I meant also to say that unless super performance is an issue, 
maintainability should weigh heavier in your mind than the performance 
degredation you'll experience.

In a situation like that, yeah.

I didn't do it.  But, I'm pretty sure it was to avoid 
name space conflicts between sequences and tables.

Hmm, I wonder what it would take to 'fix' this?  Is this something that

Nothing needs to be fixed.  If you want to access a specific DBMS 
sequence via DB's nextID() method, you'll have to change the 
seqname_format option before calling nextID().

if (! is_null($a->storage->db)) {
	$db =& $a->storage->db;
	//echo "got a " . get_class($db)." from my Auth object (-:<br />";
} else {
	$db = DB::connect(DSN);

This might not be PHP5-proof but for now, worksforme.

what is your 'session.save_path'

in the default ini (php.ini-dist)
it is usually blank -- like so:

[Session]
; Handler used to store/retrieve data.
session.save_handler = files

Maybe adding something like:
session.save_path="C:\tmp"

will help

(watch the permissions on the actual directory you use!!!)

Hey Folks,

I'm looking for suggestions/opinions about web-based project management
software.  We've been using dotProject for quite a while, and it is OK,
but it is still young and a little buggy.  Just thought I would see what
everyone else was using.  (Or, if anyone is using dotProject regularly,
I have some questions that I'd like to have answered - their forums have
not been too responsive.)

Anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?  Commercial or OS is fine, makes
no difference whether I host it or not.  Also, this is for internal
development, so billing features, and client access are not a concern.

Thanks for the feeback,

Tom

I have always liked Project KickStart http://www.projectkickstart.com/ 
as a supplement to whatever project management sw I use. It may be a bit 
bloated or outdated at this point (I haven't looked for over a year), 
but basically it's a (Windows only) gui for capturing project intent at 
the earliest stage. It walks you (and your team, hopefully) through the 
goal defining, milestones, brainstorming, etc  and then kicks out a 
basic datafile suitable for import into popular PM software. It can do 
basic charting as well.

I find it an excellent tool to project during a project kick-start 
meeting . It helps builds the team, align the objectives, and in no 
small way helps garner a bit of authority as PM (once they see the 
effectivenes of good PM). The company has also been very accommodating 
when I have asked for lower cost licensing to proviude every team member 
with a copy (BTW, they don't usually use it, but they do look at it and 
gain additional respect for the management steps I do).

Personally I do my PM by paying attention to details, and using tools, 
not PM software. Kickstart plus my spreadsheets and calendar are all I 
need... the big software usually gets in the way of actual analysis, 
IMHO, and takes too much time and attention away from managing the project.

Thanks everyone for the suggestions - I will check these out now.

I agree with you, John, and "managing" the software has proven to be
more of a pain than necessary.  The main problem we are having with
dotProject is the reporting features, and some of the calculations - the
numbers that we need to supply to management.  Hopefully some of these
other products prove to be better.

Thanks again!

Tom

The non-partisan Verified Voting Foundation is working with other
voter protection groups to make sure every vote is counted,
focusing its efforts on the new electronic voting terminals we're
all concerned about.

Their program is called TechWatch, and it will help reduce the risk
that votes will be lost or miscounted by these machines and other
technology.

Please volunteer for TechWatch at:

http://www.verifiedvoting.org/techwatch/

Geeks who sign up with TechWatch will be able to help out both 
beforehand and on Election Day.  You'll find out what kind of machines 
are being used, how they are tested, and how to tell if they are being 
used properly.  The responsibilities include:

* Observing and documenting the Logic & Accuracy testing of
voting technology by election officials before Election Day;

* Monitoring the polls on Election Day (assigned to a single
polling place or central election office);

* Reporting incidents on Election Day (dispatched to particular  polling 
places when trouble is indicated).

With your technical expertise, you can help document election
problems for follow-on litigation and policymaking in a way
that most poll watchers cannot.

More than 500 technologists have already volunteered, but it will take 
thousands of TechWatch Geeks to cover priority states and key counties, 
starting with the Florida primary on August 31 and continuing through to 
the November 2 general election.

Also, if you like to code, Verified Voting Foundation has "an urgent 
need for php programmers who want to assist with development of an 
open-source Election Incident Reporting system from now until 
September."  You can also sign up to help with this project at
their web page.

Please sign up today, at:

Thank you.

Can anyone tell me what with-regex=system?  I've just moved a client site
from my server to theirs and my regex patterns that I've been using for,
well, quite a while seem to be throwing errors now.  The php.ini shows:

--with-regex=system

Which I've never seen before.  I figure this is my brick wall.

Anyone?

Thanks!

Normally I would not support "political" posts to this list, but I 
attended a talk about the voting improprieties discovered during the 
investigations of the past year. Most of them were *not* technical but 
social engineering maneuvers which led to uncounted votes, mistakes, and 
breaks in the chain of authority which prevented accountability. It was 
recommended that people who can spot loopholes and irregularities 
volunteer to man polling places, participate in local community projects 
surrounding the voting process, etc. so that the foxes aren't the only 
ones guarding the chicken koop.

It is widely acknowledged that the people with those skillz are the 
techies like us.

I haven't looked at this particular group, but if it is simply about 
being involved and aware for the sake of due process, based on what I 
have seen it is an excellent idea.

The question of whether this post should be permitted has been discussed by 
the Board, which approved its posting (in part precisely because it is 
non-partisan).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Auth sessions
Message-ID: <EF7C44D4-EA52-11D8-8CA0-0003938BDF32@localnotion.com>

I'm using PHP 5, postgresql and Pear Auth.

if I use a table named auth with fields called username and password 
(defaults) then the typical code works fine:

require 'Auth/Auth.php';
$opts = array('table' => 'auth',  'cryptType' => 'none',  'dsn' => 
'pgsql://db_user:db_pass at db_host/db_name');
$a = new Auth('DB', $opts);
//$a->setShowLogin(false);
$a->start();  

I can login, go to google, return and I'm still logged in.

However when changing $opts to reflect my database, the session won't 
stick. I can login and retrieve my user info, but like I said, If I 
leave and return, I'm logged out.

here is the (faulty?) $opts :

$opts = array('table' => 'users',  usernamecol => 'email', 
'passwordcol' => 'pass', 'cryptType' => 'none',  'dsn' => 
'pgsql://db_user:db_pass at db_host/db_name');

By the way, cryptType of none is just for testing. : )


Thanks for any help,

Matt Terenzio

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - buildconf script now takes an optional --with-phpize=<path> option to
      specify the location of phpize script. (Andrei)
    - removed support for old build system. PHP 4.3.x is now required to
build
      PHP-GTK. (Andrei)
    - implemented append_element(), prepend_element(), insert_element(),
      append_item(), prepend_item(), and insert_item() methods of GtkToolbar
      class. (Andrei)
    - exposed the following (read-only) GtkToolbar properties: (Andrei)
        * style
        * space_style
        * space_size
        * orientation
    - reimplemented Gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap() so it actually works. (Tom

and the person said the quote was way too much, my quote was $25,000 for the entire site to be done that is tax free for them, meaning i am paying my own taxes.  Thier site included a ton of statistic features and quickbooks report integration etc...

Do you guys think i quoted high or low?

It is really hard to tell without reading a specification or proposal. 
There is quite a range out there from a $1k to $100k-plus.  Consider if
you need to hire a designer that could cost upward of $5k.  How much
back-end integration and automation is required for instance, etc...but
this brings up a topic we deal with every day.

One thing that drives me crazy about some small/mid business owners is
their cost expectation.  A SMB owner can purchase an entire
office-productivity suite for less than $500.  An accounting system for
$300.  So when they need integrated and custom work, it is a pretty big
leap for them to drop multi-$k for a project.  

It really comes down to setting expectations as early as possible (so
you don't waste hours researching and deploying).  In the initial
meeting with the client, I've found just asking for their budget is very
useful.

Yuri,

that's just it, it's not a typical shopping cart, they want to have several store fronts that can sell items.  Multiple shops where a user can navigate and order products from more than one shop in one transaction.

They also want an admin area for each shop, the main admin interface limited by access, such as admin1 has access to part of the admin area and admin2 can have access to more parts of the admin area.  If it wasnt confidential i would forward the docs to the list so you could see all of the features.  

They want to be able to have a portal for the users so that they can have

They can see the weather
See the stock market
See front page news from local newspapers
Horoscopes
Match.com
The top boxoffice numbers

Search integration including not limited to

yahoo, google

such stuff as
-message board
-classifieds
-their profile
-newsletter 
-events
-Email to a Friend recommend us kind of thing and win points program.
-Discounts, shopping within the site's community members. So they can shop between themselves and have a community discount .

so as you can see it is much more than a typical shopping cart.

this project will probably take me upwards of 6-8 months

    For a shopping cart -- maybe a little. But you would know better..you met with them and could feel them out. But hey -- a deal is made when you have a willing seller and a willing buyer! Is the quote for a jewelry store?

      Guys i have put in a quote for a site similar to

      http://www.novica.com/

      and the person said the quote was way too much, my quote was $25,000 for the entire site to be done that is tax free for them, meaning i am paying my own taxes.  Thier site included a ton of statistic features and quickbooks report integration etc...

      Do you guys think i quoted high or low?

I've found that *most* of my interactions with small clients has resulted in
blank looks once they were asked about their budgets.. and if they were a
bit larger then a small business they put on their poker face and try to
play me into quoting a price.

It would save me and them much time if we could work around their budget..
but alas few are willing to reveal this taboo issue :(

It is really hard to tell without reading a specification or proposal.
There is quite a range out there from a $1k to $100k-plus.  Consider if
you need to hire a designer that could cost upward of $5k.  How much
back-end integration and automation is required for instance, etc...but
this brings up a topic we deal with every day.

One thing that drives me crazy about some small/mid business owners is
their cost expectation.  A SMB owner can purchase an entire
office-productivity suite for less than $500.  An accounting system for
$300.  So when they need integrated and custom work, it is a pretty big
leap for them to drop multi-$k for a project.

It really comes down to setting expectations as early as possible (so
you don't waste hours researching and deploying).  In the initial
meeting with the client, I've found just asking for their budget is very
useful.

Joe -- in this instance-- your quote was rather fair in my eyes.. but hey
once they say its too much.. refer to the proposal and say -- ok which
elements can we remove so that we can fit the proposal into your alloted
budget.... if they still give you alot of BS, wish them well and move on.
Just my 2 cents.

  Yuri,

  that's just it, it's not a typical shopping cart, they want to have
several store fronts that can sell items.  Multiple shops where a user can
navigate and order products from more than one shop in one transaction.

  They also want an admin area for each shop, the main admin interface
limited by access, such as admin1 has access to part of the admin area and
admin2 can have access to more parts of the admin area.  If it wasnt
confidential i would forward the docs to the list so you could see all of
the features.

  They want to be able to have a portal for the users so that they can have

  They can see the weather
  See the stock market
  See front page news from local newspapers
  Horoscopes
  Match.com
  The top boxoffice numbers

  Search integration including not limited to

  yahoo, google

  such stuff as
  -message board
  -classifieds
  -their profile
  -newsletter
  -events
  -Email to a Friend recommend us kind of thing and win points program.
  -Discounts, shopping within the site?s community members. So they can shop

  so as you can see it is much more than a typical shopping cart.

Yuri,

thanks for your opinion i am going to talk with the client and see what can be done.  It is actually a client of another company who wanted me to quote the job.  I think they just want me to develop this really cheap to increase thier profits i am not sure.  Thanks for all of your input on this situation.

How true!  But I don't think we can lay all the blame at the client.
There's always a lot of hocus-pocus on both sides - much of which are the
characteristics of a young, "undisciplined" [Econ 101] industry.  

As a rather rough [pardon me] analogy, I suggest looking at the automobile
repair industry.  15 - 20 years ago you could go to several garages and get
several different quotes to do a particular job.  Today, they all quote out
of the same book (x number of hours at $y/hour).

OK...where am I going with this?  Perhaps in an effort to start to
standardize rates and jobs (and remove some of the hocus pocus) NYPHP could
set up a database of positions/rates and job/efforts.  From that the whole
community could benefit.

For example:

Database modeling - $x/hour  
Standard shopping cart - y man-hours

Really crude, I know, but [hopefully] you get the idea.

I've found that *most* of my interactions with small clients has resulted in
blank looks once they were asked about their budgets.. and if they were a
bit larger then a small business they put on their poker face and try to
play me into quoting a price.

It would save me and them much time if we could work around their budget..
but alas few are willing to reveal this taboo issue :(

It is really hard to tell without reading a specification or proposal. There
is quite a range out there from a $1k to $100k-plus.  Consider if you need
to hire a designer that could cost upward of $5k.  How much back-end
integration and automation is required for instance, etc...but this brings
up a topic we deal with every day.

One thing that drives me crazy about some small/mid business owners is their
cost expectation.  A SMB owner can purchase an entire office-productivity
suite for less than $500.  An accounting system for $300.  So when they need
integrated and custom work, it is a pretty big leap for them to drop
multi-$k for a project.

It really comes down to setting expectations as early as possible (so you
don't waste hours researching and deploying).  In the initial meeting with
the client, I've found just asking for their budget is very useful.

Your experience reminds me of my past experiences dealing with projects 
via Rentacoder. There most of your small businesses would collect bids 
and proposals from individual coders, but none of them would dare 
provide the rather fair quote you provided of $25K; in fact, it would be 
far far lower, say around.. $250.

Then again, the small businesses would instantly scoop them up, ask for 
impossible deadlines and demands including UI, secured processing and 
other unusual demands, and expect it to be done in 15 days or less.

Oh did I mention where these coders usually wind up coming from? Can you 
say INDIA?

Hope your experience is far more fruitful than mine!

      Yuri,

      that's just it, it's not a typical shopping cart, they want to have several store fronts that can sell items.  Multiple shops where a user can navigate and order products from more than one shop in one transaction.

      They also want an admin area for each shop, the main admin interface limited by access, such as admin1 has access to part of the admin area and admin2 can have access to more parts of the admin area.  If it wasnt confidential i would forward the docs to the list so you could see all of the features.  

      They want to be able to have a portal for the users so that they can have

      They can see the weather
      See the stock market
      See front page news from local newspapers
      Horoscopes
      Match.com
      The top boxoffice numbers

      Search integration including not limited to

      yahoo, google

      such stuff as
      -message board
      -classifieds
      -their profile
      -newsletter 
      -events
      -Email to a Friend recommend us kind of thing and win points program.
      -Discounts, shopping within the site's community members. So they can shop between themselves and have a community discount .

      so as you can see it is much more than a typical shopping cart.

      this project will probably take me upwards of 6-8 months

      Joe Crawford Jr.

I agree with you here.
Everybody likes to play the little game of "He who mentions a dollar
amount first loses."

I usually try to explain to potential clients that if I can at least get
a ballpark range that I can tailor the proposal to fit within that.
It's only semi-effective as everybody wants the best solution for the
lowest price and still have a hard time understanding that $1000 does
not get you a $100,000 solution.

Really depends..
You will see people bid super low on things like this on scriptlance and
rentacoder (and my site listbid.com) just to get talking with the buyer.
If you have a very good team of people to do this, you could
realistically charge between 20 and 40k depending on how much graphical
work they need and if things need to be specialized and built from
scratch.

However, if you can use pre-built carts and stuff you could go as low as
5-10k and have something like this built-out in a couple weeks easy. 
But: The main issue with these is "always" feature-creep and maintenance
which will chew into your profits horribly unless you clearly define a
"Maintenance hourly contract".

My recommendation (from working at various custom site shops and having
done a lot of these) if you are working solo would be $25 hour coding
(basic php and html, templates, graphics etc) and $40-70/hour for any
database specific work (which you can explain is "specialized work",
don't mention the fact the whole thing is built on a database, this
gives you a great way to deter certain 'features' the client thinks they
want). If you have several people working with you and have an
established name for yourself, you could go as high as $75-125/hour for
billing on any work and specialized network coding starts at $150/hour
for a professional. (i.e. if they want some news rdf scraper)

Another note: Always, always, always double your quoted time (when
working by yourself) unless your know for a certain fact that you can do
it within that time period. Having seen this firsthand many times, it
will give you some flex area and you can sometimes come in below the
quote which makes the client very happy.

I agree with you here.
Everybody likes to play the little game of "He who mentions a dollar
amount first loses."

I usually try to explain to potential clients that if I can at least get
a ballpark range that I can tailor the proposal to fit within that.
It's only semi-effective as everybody wants the best solution for the
lowest price and still have a hard time understanding that $1000 does
not get you a $100,000 solution.

no :) remember -- willing buyer and willing seller - this should be your
mantra too!!!! Would your competition jump on it? If this client went to a
new firm and said "oh yury quoted me a price of 4799.99 on my budget of 5k
for the project".. the new firm will say - Oh we can give you a very good
deal of only 4150.00 and we'll build you a Free sitemap!. They'd go to
rentadesigner and get a template built for 100.00 and viola.. much profit.
I'll take these clients all day long. please.. if you have them send them my
way :> Free sitemaps for all!

That blank stare is a bummer!  It's important to be tactful when
broaching price and budget.

Some will come out and say "I have a $10k budget to work with", others
can glaze over or become anxious when talking about a budget.  After
discussing the project details, I try to have a quick estimate ready. 
"This feels like we are in the $20-25k range.  Is this in line with your
expectations?".

This kind of communication is sometimes difficult, but most clients will
appreciate the upfront honesty.  And once the cat is out of the bag, the
topic becomes less taboo and more manageable and more fair for both
sides.


Some other (unwarranted) advice is to try not to make cost the focus of
the conversation, highlight the results you can provide.  Most clients
are excited about their project, that enthusiasms is great to work
with.  

People tend to remember the opening and (especially) the closing of a
conversation, so I try to touch on the budget somewhere in the middle
instead of waiting until the end.  It also helps to offer flexible
payment terms, small businesses are very cash-flow conscious.


Anyway, just some suggestions.

- Brian

My personal opinion is that we have been going through a technology 
"backlash" for the past 3 years. All those Web wannabe's overcharged in 
the 90s and the pebdulum has swung to the other extreme. People simply 
do not want to pay New York prices for contracting work (that is, if you 
can find any contracting work at all in the first place). Its all very 
depressing. Makes you want to just quit and go work on a farm.

I absolutely agree.  I tend to aim high and make the price very matter of
fact, ensuring phenomenal service and great work.  Also, double your time is
a minimum.  Expect problems with the host, meetings, miscommunication, sick
days, and anything else that could possibly halt the project for days on
end.  And don't let the blank stare scare you.  When they give you a 'more
reasonable' number, give them that same look, even more prolonged.  When
they lose confidence, cut some functionality and meet them in the middle.

Love this thread. And some great advice has already been posted. I
completely concur with all of Joel De Gan's points, too. And I sympathize
with Ajai's remarks.

I wanted to also add, in the beginning of Brooks's The Mythical Man-Month,
he makes a big point about the difference between a Software Application and
a Programming System. Not to be pedantic, but briefly: a programming system
differs in that it is extensible and adaptable in the future. In web
parlance, we can say the difference between a first-generation PHP site
(with code and logic interspersed throughout and procedural calls placed
directly in the scripts) vs. a web-application built on a framework that is
OO, component-based, internationalized, and skinable. Clearly the latter has
tons more value. Brooks concludes the exact amount is **9** times the
financial cost.

It may be possible to meet some clients' needs with very unsophisticated
brute-force solutions. And sometimes this is exactly what the client wants
and needs. There are PC-based apps that generate PHP and SQL code already.
And some websites may be a matter of designing nice HTML-based templates,
and utilizing these applications to inject some generic features.

Another possibility, maybe even another tier lower, would be to try to
implement an "off-the-shelf" solution like MamboServer or Plone, or even a
slick blogger; and then customize the look and feel for them. A solution
like this could be provided for under $1,000.

So, I usually make these distinctions clear to my clients. If what they want
is a Programming System, that is going to carry a much higher price tag (9x
according to Brooks, but you all know this to be the case from experience
anyway). If your client laughs at you when you say you can at the push of a
button dish out his site in French or German, then clearly that is a case of
your desires for boss programming architecture over-ruling the needs of your
client.

So, I'd say read your client. Explain these possibilities and consequences.
Explain the pros and cons of building specialized apps verses programming
systems. Ultimately at the end of the discussion, the client should see
clearly the justification for their budget. I believe it is possible, in
broad terms, to communicate this to the client.

:) yes but we have people with *web-app visions* and shoe string budgets :)

All the points stated are quite valid -- selling on price alone is a bad way
to do business, just as you can undercut the next guy, your client will be
stolen from you by the next lower price.

We've kind of strayed away from Josephs original question: was his quote
fair?

Initially i thought it was a bit high, but after him explaining the details,
I thing its fair.. i would have added some on top to be safe. But the client
in the end makes the decisions -- all we can do is try to educate them (
using marks, joels and eddie's suggestions ).. all great points.

and if that doesn't work  -  we'll look into starting a medical marijuana
farm..

The issue I was addressing was the clients who want the equivalent of
amazon.com for under $5,000 ... and if you have not run across one of
these, you have been under a rock.

Prices quoted were for business contracts, not little mom and pop shops
(which don't pay anything and have a tendency to think the kid down the
road could do it anyway).

I have done the majority of my work for corporations. Bothering with a
site under 5k is usually a complete waste of time. 

Don't work cheap people, they think you are cheap.

Joe,
My initial reaction is that your quote is fair and reasonable.  I've 
built a couple projects this large and they were in your price range.  
That being said it's hard to not get a project like this.  They can get 
it built for considerably less money, they could use OSC as the core 
shopping cart, and then start leveraging stuff into it.  Then they're 
in trouble going forward.  Sometimes I ask the client when do they want 
to pay the piper? Now? Later?  Unfortunately the answer is too often, 
later.  I tend to let those folks work with someone else.  They 
typically end up spending 3x - 5x more than they needed to on the 
project.
I resonate with the sentiments, about the need to get people educated 
about the true costs of development projects.
Chris

not illegal.  Big biz does this all the time via newspapers, TV, etc. (you
don't really think the airlines are announcing a price hike for any other

I agree that collusion is something to worry about, however, in our highly

Hi Joseph,

Any site that's gonna cost over $10,000 really needs to be built in a 
two (or more) stage process.

Stage one is creating a detailed specification of what the clients will 
get - what the end result will be.
This can also be thought of a user manual / blueprint of the site.

Stage two is the actual creation.
The is the building of the site.

Sometimes there is a stage three of what they get after you're done.

A good analogy to give to clients is that they want to create a building 
but first need to create a detailed blueprint.

You should separate both stages regarding cost.
A serious client understands the importance of creating good specs.

Offer to do just stage one for $X and then when they have the specs you 
can give a price for doing the entire site, but tell them that they're 
free to do the implementation with anyone they want.

If the client only cares about price, you're better off having someone 
else do the implementation anyways.
If they can appreciate excellent quality and service, then you should be 
able to show them such during phase one and have won them over.

Personally, if a client isn't prepared to spend at least $500 for the 
specs of an over $10,000 project, I'd beware.

An interesting project would be to begin something like the Graphic 
Artists Guild & their Handbook of Pricing & Ethical Guidelines.
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0932102123

They've published their 11th edition (I think they're about 20-25 years 
old), and the FTC hasn't troubled them yet... It is an amazing 
resource, would be nice to have something similar for our corner of the 
world. The Guild also provides legal help with disputes and other 
services, a well organized model worthy of emulation.

Interesting professional discussion here... nice to see it.

If I may offer some different perspective :  if you are a general 
contractor, you approach the client completely differently, with plans 
to get the job at any price over some minimum you know you can meet 
specs with after cutting all corners. You know those numbers going in, 
so if they say $5k you farm it to Elbonia out as a CMS customization job 
for $3500; and if they say $25,000 you hire your buddies and do a great 
job you can build upon. Keep in mind in tis case you are in the business 
of estimating and project managing, NOT coding.

If you are a coder and a company approaches you to bid on a full project 
(like this one) you are at a serious disadvantage. Since you are a 
coder, you know all the intangibles they can never see clearly until 
they feel the pain. You can't see the forest for the trees; they can't 
see the trees but see the forest.

With a request like this, either you step back and play project 
manager/GC, or pass this newbie client to a programming shop for a 
referral fee. If  they are also middlemen on this, as you suggest, then 
more reason to distance yourself from any obligation but strong, 
specific written requirements (not just "make a site like this other one 
with these features"). If they balk at a price without careful scruitiny 
of your specific implementation plans, that's also a sign of trouble.

I work in website optimization, which involves fixing 
normal-to-above-average websites so they actually achieve their 
objectives (turning committe-designed brochure sites into lead 
generators, category leaders, sales engines, or advertisements, or 
whatever).  One of the guidelines for website optimization work is NEVER 
take a client who has *never* worked with an optimization firm or 
consultant (i.e. no newbies) and also *never* take a client who has 
worked with more than two optimization firms in three years. The newbies 
simply will not see the value and therefore won't pay well enough (in 
money or collaborative effort). The latter wasn't able to do it at least 
twice already (if you work well with an optimization firm it's a win-win 
for everyone, and you would most likely want to work with them again).

Sure it means passing over lots of business opportunitities.....  but 
knowing that 90% of my new business comes by referral from past (happy) 
customers, are they really business opoortunities? Perhaps it is better 
to let the seeds germinate into plants before transplanting them into 
the front garden.

Following up about the paranoia:

I'm basing my caveat on things I observed in the translation and
interpreting industry in the 1990s. Some translator/interpreter
organizations like ATA (atanet.org)  and AIIC (aiic.net) and NAJIT
(najit.org) were given various degrees of grief by the FTC for publishing
stuff about how to price things. It's wise to be careful about saying
things like charge more or charge less for x or y.

(But, again, if you're say Archer Daniels Midland and you fix prices and
screw consumers big time on purpose, you'll get at worst a paltry
$300,000,000 fine, or thereabouts.)

What about saying "I charge x for y". If I can put this on my website, 
is it any different than telling people on a mailing list? Membership 
on this list isn't restricted, so if a customer were curious, they 
could always sign up and see what developers are talking about. 
Similarly, a customer can write me and ask, "how much do you charge for 
y?" How different is this if I go on this list and ask, "How much do 
you all charge for y?" After all, we are all each other's potential 
customers/clients.

No, I am pretty sure no one can give you a hard time about publishing your
own rates. Anyway, I don't claim legal expertise on this or anything else;
I do know that people have been given a hard time by the authorities for
discussing how they set their prices. Take it cum grano salis, as they
say...

Mind you there's a huge difference between discussing how you determine 
what you charge, versus working collaboratively to set prices that we 
informally agree to use.

It's the collusion that is the problem, not the dissemination of 
information, especially in an industry that hasn't gone through rounds 
of aggregation, like ours.

If there were two developers, then yes, it would be a problem.

For anyone who might be interested. I was having a problem with Auth 
sessions sticking and found the problem went away  when the <?php tag 
was on line 1.

It also broke when I put the tag on line 1 of a file and then included 
that file into another page.

Can anyone verify that this is actually the way it works? It seems  
like you would want to have one login.php file that gets included 
around the site but uhhh.....

At http://pear.php.net/package/Cache/download/ you'll notice that the
changelog includes this:

- Removed Cache_DB as it apparently never really worked.

Ouch. I fixed one bug in it, and tried to offer my fix to the maintainers
via PEAR's bug reporting system, and I was essentially ignored, so I had a
hunch that it was being neglected, but...  never really worked? I ran a
couple of tests and profiled some code and stuff and it certainly seemed
to be doing ~something~ right ... umm, such as getting data out of a
filesystem cache instead of contacting the db.

Anyway:  what do you guys recommend? I often use shared servers where db
performance sometimes sucks -- more than likely because of sloppy
application coding -- and I like to be part of the solution by caching
frequently requested but rarely changing data. I see Cache and Cache_Lite
are out there but I'm fishing for expert opinion.

I am a huge fan of ADOdb's query cache - similar to MySQL's but it lives 
on the webserver (saving you a round trip to the data box) and is 
database-agnostic.  However, working on the Mambo project I learned from 
recent posts that caching at the page level provides a bigger benefit - 
you cache more than just the data, you cache the generated output as 
well.  I also learned that on underpowered webservers, ADOdb's query 
cache is actually a performance hit, not a gain.

For each application you have to consider the usage patterns, overall 
architecture, and environment - but it seems pretty safe to say that you 
should get real cozy with PEAR's Cache_Lite...

Just IMHO, of course ;-)

Hey gang,

I am building a site where you can see how many members are logged in 
for each group.  After looking around, I see that this is being done by 
forums, some CMS, and may even be integrated with PEAR's AUTH.  The site 
uses ADOdb, and I am considering using ADOdb's session storage as it 
also can run user defined functions when sessions expire.

So I am also certain that there are several ways to tackle this 
problem.  Knowing that performance and scalability is an absolute must, 
what is the best approach?

#1) In the accounts table, also have a column of 'logged_in', as a 
boolean; and then count the 'true's for each group.
#2) Create a linked table, 'group_counts'; and store each account_id in 
there while the session is still active
#3) ???

This group is hot enough that I am certain some of you have come up with 
very solid approaches to this problem - and I wanna hear them!

Better yet just count the files that are in your session save directory ;)

i saw a tutorial i believe on weberdev.com for this use.
oh and with PHP 5 you can use static properties so you could do it that way
but it wouldnt decrement unless the person logged out, i think going with
the session way is best.

Of course you have to accept the latency.... at any given time it shows 
# people active as of a few minutes ago, because of uncleared yet 
no-longer-active sessions. Can be a problem if the community likes to 
see who is on and attempt to chat.....

Thanks for the $.02. Good timing: I was just starting to mess with
Cache_Lite and finding it pretty cool.

Static properties only persist for the life of a single request. So
while they're shared among all instances of a class, they can't really
be used in this case.

There are JavaScript and flash solutions that calculate exact seconds of
every page-view. Check into those technologies.

If you really wanna know as much as you can about page-view duration and
user stickiness set up a socket connection between an invisible flash movie
on the user's page and a simple PHP socket "page-views" server. And the
funny thing is I'm not even joking.

Hi all,

What will it be the fastest way of converting a text file into a xml 
one?
I have several files produced all with the same architecture and want 
to pass them to a xml parser which feeds a database. Expect from 
writing a parser (again!), do you have any other ideas?

Thank you

yvan

I've done this for 3 projects (intranets) and it worked incredibly well.
The issue becomes that once you have a socket server script / app setup for
such a minor task, the temptation to build something far more robust -
similar to one of Colin Moock's intra-page chats, 'live' user viewers, PM's,
live forums and whatever else a socket connection from every page can afford
you - becomes unbearable.

patServer is a pretty good start, for a php based socket server:

<http://www.php-tools.de/site.php?file=patServer/overview.xml>

And I put up a very basic, um, story for communicating with a socket server
from flash:

I'd love to, but I need to aggregate those counts in groups ("125 people 
in group A" etc.).

One of the biggest issues is lock contention on the accounts table, as 
it is constantly getting hammered with SELECTs ('SELECT count(*) FROM 
accounts WHERE group = 3 AND online = 1'), and constantly getting 
hammered with UPDATEs when 10,000 people show up and login ('UPDATE 
accounts SET online = 1 WHERE id = 12323').

Ultimately, the output would include:

group 1   3,545 online
group 2   4,292 online
group 3   5,123 online
...and so on...

The site gets over 3.5 million page views daily, and averages around 
10,000 people logging in daily.  Served on two dual Xeon servers, the 
hardware is fine, but the statistics in MySQL show that InnoDB has some 
major lock issues:

----------
SEMAPHORES
----------
OS WAIT ARRAY INFO: reservation count 1823, signal count 1709
Mutex spin waits 153589, rounds 772170, OS waits 437
RW-shared spins 1276, OS waits 587; RW-excl spins 531, OS waits 103


These stats were collected right after a restart in the morning, with 
less than 1,000 people online.

I'm redesigning the site with fixes to the most glaring architectural 
issues (using classes instead of redundant includes scattered randomly 
about the filesystem is a big plus), and also will be switching to 
PostgreSQL ;-)

So again, my biggest dilemma is deciding how to separate the account 
info that is static (username, email) with stuff that is constantly 
changing (online status, last logged in timestamp).  Any pearls of 
wisdom out there?

I'm developing an internal application that takes information about
network traffic, and stores it in tables, currently MySQL, for each
month. A merge table gets queried instead of having to look through
each table. Now, the problem is, we're looking at more than 30M records/mo
and MySQL is just barfing. I'm getting the notorious error 127 from the
table handler, and bad corruption if I am foolish enough to try to delete
from the tables. The backend feeding the database is perl, and the frontend,
of course, is PHP. My only alternative at this point is to go to another
'robust' database like Postresql or Oracle. My inclination is Postgresql.
Not having any experience lately with Postgresql, I'm turning to the collective
brainpower of this group. Porting the code from MySQL to Postgresql seems
straightforward. Does Postgresql have something like Merge Tables? What
about performance. What does anyone thing will be the performance loss/gain
on the move? It's on a 2.8Ghz P4/2G RAM machine.

I haven't thought this out Mitch, but  could one possibly name each 
group session differently and then get a count of all active sessions 
with  each individual named session. Don't flame me anyone, but this 
would be a little more straight forward inside a servlet container.

Well, if Oracle didn't work, I'd be surprised. However, the data
stream is quite large, and the Oracle server I'd have to use would be
not on the local machine, which, in my uninformed opinion, would be a
bottleneck itself. Anything local should be better. I'm hoping that 
Postgres will work.

I guess I can use a view instead of a Merge table...

Have you considered preprocessing/aggregating the 
information for the most popular queries?

What I am suggesting is creating some redundant 
and somewhat out of date (perhaps good up to the day before)
tables which sum up data for the current month.

This is assuming the queries wouldn't need up to 
minute information and would be sort of 'same old selects' 
in nature.

Yup, it's not feasable.

Some of what I'm storing is data from one of our network sensors that
show every connection, src and dst IPs. For each month, I'm building
a table that has a unique record for every pair, no matter how many
times the connection was made. querying for an ip, whether src or dst,
there's just no way of preprocessing that. Also, combined volume of traffic
for each record is stored. It's adding up to quite a few records...

We're using PostgreSQL 7.3 on Trafficmac to do ad trafficking and 
maintain ad and banner statistics/billing for some very busy web sites 
(FoxNews, Wall Street Journal, MSN, SmartMoney) and it's not failed us 
yet, and these are shared servers running on commodity hardware.

Databases should run on dedicated servers anyway where, if nothing else, 
they're not in competition with other services for resources and where 
you can add more web servers as traffic increases.

Hi Mitch:

Have a table with two columns: group_name and group_count.  Each time 
someone logs in, update the group_count column with group_count+1 for 
the appropriate group_name.  When someone logs out, do a -1.

The same problem exists when doing the sums you mentioned doing in 
your earlier posts.  There needs to be an automatic way to log out 
timed out scripts and that process should do the decrement.

Counting online users is really two problems:

1. How do you know when a user is "online"
2. How do you efficiently store the online user count.

Regarding how do you know when a user is online, there is no simple and 
accurate way of knowing how many users currently have their browser open 
and are viewing a page on the site with standard HTML pages. (yes, 
technically you could use flash/java and open a socket connection but 
that would be an extreme resource hog just for online user counts).

First of all, you need to ask yourself how YOU define an online user.
Most people define a user to be online if they've *requested* a page 
within the last X minutes. I've seen values from 2 to 30 minutes.

Regarding how to store the info, a problem like this is just asking for 
a local memory based solution, but since you said the site runs on two 
servers the simplest solution would be to use a MySQL HEAP (memory) 
table with 3 columns: username/ID, group and last seen.
Even with 40,000 people online at a time the used memory will be minimal.
You should not be updating your accounts table (which is probably very 
big) to store online info.

Then, every 5 minutes delete from table where last seen > 10 minute ago.
Instead of updating the last seen column EVERY time a logged in user 
views a page, store a cookie that says when they last told the server 
they were seen.
If it's over 5 minutes, then update the database. That way you're 
guaranteed at most one update per online user per 5 minutes.

Hope that helps,

Good solution.

Another, somewhat wackier one is to embed a 1x1 on each page, its 
argument being the user's authenticated login name.  This would make a 
request to a dedicated server running either a script or possibly an 
Apache module that would extract the username and update a heap table 
with the current time.  Every couple of minutes the table of usernames 
would be dumped to an HTML file for display in your "Who's On" list. 
Every 30 minutes or so, a script would purge names with last-request 
times > 30 minutes.

This presumes a dynamic web site.  What's nice about this approach is 
that it's decoupled from your main web site and database, which doesn't 
have to do anything to maintain that list.

Forgive me if you have already tried this, but I find when odd problems like
this creep up it's from either:
    1) text gremlins from a copy/paste off the web: invisible ascii
characters used for spacing on web pages that cause execution errors in
scripts 
    (or)
    2) bad line-feeds. Unix is \n, but sometimes you'll see \r

It's probably not this, but doesn't hurt to rule it out on all apparently
inexplicable problems. Hope it helps,

Of course, you would have to record the connecting IP on the first page 
request and keep track of that on the server to reduce the likelyhood of 
it being spoofed...

Im planning a web-based application where users upload text files to a

Aj,

What about a verity search?  The later versions of the verity search engine is a LOT less buggy that the earlier versions.  And then you also open the door to searching other binary files as well (e.g.:Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF files that have been OCR'd).  Then you could keep the files in a directory stucture rather than as BLOBs or CLOBs.

The only drawback is that you might need two search queries... one for information kept in a db (certain file information or other unrelated info) and another for the files indexed by the Verity search engine. In my work with ColdFusion, the last couple of versions allow for a Select query that has multiple searches in one query (e.g. search this db and then do this Verity search and return the aggregate results into one page).  Perhaps php may have a simiar query method?

Just some Thursday afternoon musings.....

You can always attach a unique id to avoid caching:

'"<img 
src="http://www.spyware.com/trojan_images/listener.php?login=poor_sap at bigbro
ther.com&uniqueid='.md5(uniqid()).'" height="1" width="1">"'

Even better, You can email these gifs to people and track when they read
your emails. 

Yikes!
E

PS: I don't know if browsers cache to the left of the "?" only in the URL or
the whole URL, but you could either additionally:
    a) pass the id info to the script as additional path info (I think PHP
still supports this),
eg:../trojan_images/listener.php/poor_sap at bigbrother.com/SOME_UNIQUE_ID

    b) Or, use apache's mod rewrite:
    .../trojan_images/listener/poor_sap at bitbrother.com/SOME_UNIQUE_ID
    gets rewritten as:
.../trojan_images/listener.php?email=poor_sap at bigbrother.com&uniqueid=SOME_U
NIQUE_ID

Yep - this why Im loathe to open spam messages since spammers could 
track images in HTML-formatted email and see if you read their email.

Luckily, with the preferences setup the right way in Mozilla you can 
mark a message as spam without ever opening it - this has helped train 
my Bayesian filter pretty well now. I also note, in 1.7 (maybe it was in 
1.6 too) a new preference under Privacy: "Do not load images in mail and 
newsgroup messages" which can also guard against this kind of thing...

Unless you're like me and use an uncool mail client like Pine... Then

This is becoming less reliable.  Since the obvious advantage to spammers, so
they know you've seen their email, email clients are beginning to block
images pending image download approval.  Outlook 03 does this (which I'm
grateful for), and I recall yahoo doing it as well.  I figure hotmail and
gmail will if they don't already, and I'm sure other email clients
should/will soon.

IE and firefox definitely do, and I believe the other majors do as well.
It's a known method to use when working with flash to ensure your flash
movies are never cached (for site upgrades).

Pine is great for reading email on the server directly - I use it all 
the time for work. (Being impervious to virii and HTML tricks is majorly 
cool in my book).

Why use Outlook for anything? Is this corporate mandate or what? Many 
people are still using the old OutLook and so get infected and spammed 
constantly.

Set the http header instructing the browser not to cache it.

I'm not a huge fan of MS for lots of reasons, security being a big one, BUT,
I feel outlook 03 is by far one of the best email clients I've ever used
(and I've tried at least 30 windows email clients - large and small).
Personally, I've had no security issues with it (thus far).  I tend not to
recommend it (hold this reply) as I know MS can hardly be trusted, but until
the day I can get similar or better functionality from another developer, I
have to stick with it for email.

Can you run a db or SQLlite on your local server? Rather than resort to 
flat files I like to keep a small cache db with a copy of any recent 
data in it. Such that my code tries the cache db first and if there 
isn't a copy of the data there then it connects to the regular db and 
tries running the query. Obviously each result from the regular db is 
cached after use and periodically I run a command on the cache to erase 
outdated data. I've found this is especially useful for working with 
paged data such as search results. This way the results won't change as 
the user flips pages of results which is something I find annoying when 
using websites. My db layout is pretty simple usually. A field for the 
query, a field for the timestamp, and a field for the result. Then I 
create one such row for each result for that query.

Another option I sometimes use is writing an XML-RPC interface to each 
of my db queries and then letting my app talk to the db through that 
interface. Because XML-RPC usually runs over HTTP you can easily set the 
cache life of the result. Then simply run a proxy (such as Squid) 
between your app and your db. I rather like this method because it 
removes all db logic from my apps and means I don't have to have any 
open ports to my db at all. Just let the db server's local web server 
talk to the db. It also means that if you want to create other 
interfaces to the db that you can write those interfaces in any language 
that has an XML-RPC library and you don't have to duplicate any queries.

I wish this were a DATE_FORMAT option...

How do I turn a MySQL DATETIME field (0000-00-00 00:00) into a Unix
timestamp?

Strtotime() choked.

Sorry, this is really a follow up to another thread which was 
discussing the problem. But basically that was it, Authentication was 
working, but  not the session portion. In other words, I had to 
re-login whenever I refreshed the page. At that time, I had the Auth 
logic embedded or included into the middle of some other HTML.

When I moved it to the top of the page, the session portion worked 
fine. I thought this was odd and not  very flexible, but the trick, I 
guess, is to include the Auth classes at the VERY top and do a 
$a->start();    and you put other Auth logic anywhere on the page. But, 
still that seems to me that if you want the login form somewhere else 
but the top, you need to use a custom login form, not the Auth 
generated one, but I haven't played with it enough to see if there is a 
way around that as well.

Be very, very careful when you encounter small business owners who don't 
really understand what's involved in programming. If there's any way in 
the world you can do it, charge by the hour. They will call you about 
everything, expect everything to be done fast, change their mind 
constantly, and think they're doing you a big favor.

If they think your quote was way out of bounds this might be a sign to 
move on. Delivering pizzas or making coffee at Starbucks could end up 
being more profitable and less ulcer inducing in the end.

Hello there,

I've seen programmers certificates for C++, Java, and even for 
JavaScript, but what about PHP?  It's there any entity who sells 
programmer certificates for PHP? 
How PHP programmers sign their applications?
It's gpg the only way to do it?
Please, thanks in advance for any information regarding to this.

I am working with a client who has a LINUX server for web serving, ftp,  etc, 
and a Windows 2003 internal network.  The internal network is very  simple.  
Basically a couple of small MS workgroups attached to a Windows  2003 server.  
 
When setting up Outlook to talk to the LINUX server, I am able to retrieve  
messages over POP3 without a problem.  However, I cannot send SMTP  messages.  
I get various SMTP errors from the LINUX server.  
 
Has anyone encountered this?  Any help would be very greatly  appreciated.
 
Thank you

I'll bet you have/had a lovely combination of issues:
1) You're using cookies for the session data.
2) The cookies couldn't be set because the space at the top of the 
file was considered output, so further headers couldn't be sent 
(cookies are sent in the HTTP header)
3) You have your error reporting turned off, so you didn't get the 
infamous headers already sent error message.

So, you've solved 2, so now fix 3.  Set error reporting to E_ALL and 
display_errors = On so you start writing good code.

I use both GPG and md5 sums, so people can verify things the way they

Any reason not to just set the cache info? Easy enough to do using 
either PHP or Apache and all major browsers handle it in at least 
something close to the right behavior.

I do something like this for static files in Apache:
 ExpiresActive on
 ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 minute"
 ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 week"
 ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 week"
 ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 week"

And I set the proper http headers for each of my PHP pages to get the 
same effect for scripts. Obviously to avoid caching rather than 
encouraging it as I have done you'd just change the life of the objects 
to something small.

Sorry, but that was my grumpy way of hinting that since your question
was in no ways at all PHP related, that maybe another mailing list
would be a more appropriate forum.

It's usually good if your question can at least be slightly related to
PHP. So, trying to use PHP with SMTP would be fine, but Outlook and
SMTP is a bit of a stretch, even if some list members are happy to
help you out.

I kind of take the lazy guy approach. Basically osCommerce has a 
routine (how many php programmers have contributed to that application? 
  100's?  1000's?), they have a module that does most anything you want. 
First you'll pull out your hair and scream and yell, "they're nuts, 
it's  a mess, it's crazy how they do that.", after a few hours you'll 
say "hey, that's a brilliant approach".  Sort of like ones first 
experience meeting up with Unix.

Yes, they have a "count users module" built into osCommerce.  Just have 
to dig it out. :-)

This fixes, among other things, the nasty bug that broke PHP's support

What are the error messages?

("It dont work" isn't a very useful error message when troubleshooting 
something technical ;-)


p.s. I know its an AOL email address but please try posting in plain

True I have not explicitly not used cookies.  I don't consider this an 
issue, do you ? Won't the PHP session object handle cases where cookies 
are disallowed. Maybe that's a wrong assumption of mine leftover from 
JSP class.

You got that right, I'd say. Thanks for the explanation.

display_errors is on and set to 8. Is that different than E_ALL?(by the 
time you answer I will have investigated) Thanks for the heads up. I 
changed to E_ALL and restarted Apache and still can't get a warning or 
error. (I will try harder when I have time)

What's the big deal or why would you sign a php script or file? i have never
understood the meaning of signing files.

Why sign a contract, a check, etc.  To prove authenticity.  If you 
download files from a mirror, you need to make sure the mirror wasn't 
compromized.  Or even the original server.  Forgery does happen.

Then, once you've verified the file before installing, you know the files' 
signagures so can check to see if the installed files on your server are 
still correct.  If the signatures match, you're fine.  If not, you know an 
intrusion has happened.

Dan,

but the fact of signing a php app when it is not obfuscated say with zend
encoder what is the point? the key or md5 sum is publicly viewable and
changeable hence it doesnt make any sense.

Zend encoding has nothing to do with it.

Depends what you're looking for.

If the main server is compromised and someone changes the tarball and the 
md5, youre right.

Sidebar:  This is why SIGNING with GPG/etc is superior, because the 
intruder would need to know your secret passphrase to create a valid 
signature for the file.

BUT, if you install a program, and then, on your own, determine the md5 
sums and store them in a secure manner, you can use md5's to ensure your 
server is in good health.

Of course, any security measures can be circumnavigated somehow.  But that 
doesn't mean we shouldn't undertake security measures.

Dan,

am i wrong or is MD5 and GPG in the php code such as variables, that is how
i would picture signing a php script.

Or are you talking about compressing the files and signing the zip/rar file.

Hi Joe:

I'm talking about two things.  One is program distribution.  The other 
is intrusion detection.  Neither involve a doing run time checks in 
your scripts.

Well, estimate how many hours it will take you, and multiply by your 
hourly rate ;-)

Anything beyond that, and the tinfoil hats will descend on the price

I really love reading the posts from this group, and I think it is great to have
lively threads about the issues we all face in commercial PHP consulting;
covering techniques and pointers to approaching new projects and even
generalities about quoting.

However, specific projects ought to be confidential.  As a newbie on this list,
I am far from a list-authority (especially being from Boston), but really would
hate to see this list become a general collusion of threads about pricing
specific projects.  BTW, doesn't this violate the NYPHP-list non-commercial
mantra?

We have absolutely no idea how much time it will take you and therefore 
we can not estimate this for you.  I could not even tell you how long 
this would take me because I do not have the details of the project and 
this is not an appropriate place to share those details.

Estimating is a skill that is learned through do it.  You have to figure 
out your capabilities and your customer's requirements.  Take some time 
and write a list of what it take to execute this project and estimate 
how much time each component will take and double that time.  Then 
follow the instructions Mitch provided.  Face it, you are going to screw 
up a lot of estimates while learning, be prepared to manage expectations 
and eat a little dirt once in a while.

Good Luck,
Hans Kaspersetz

Anyone here ever seen a class that can resemble a dataset?

here is what i would like to do, create a class that will take and SQL query/command and execute it but also get all the table info such as row name and value and store it in the object, i can then be disconnected from the DB, add/edit/delete from the dataset and then run an update command to update the actual database, i think having things like this would make the site a bit faster as i wouldnt have so many db connections for each user session.

I have found WebPanels (http://tanus.dotgeek.org) but that seems a bit more complex in the OOP area for me.

If it is "signed" then you know it has not been modified since it was 
released by the author. If it is not signed, then it may have been 
modified - in worst case, it may have been corrupted or it may have been 
loaded with a virus/worm/trojan. With complex scripts, it would be 
relatively easy to hide a backdoor inside, for example.

"signing" can be as simple as including a hash value with the code, so 
the code can be re-hashed by the recipient (if the value matches, it 
hasn't been modified -- with ridiculously high probability). It could 
also be encrypted with keys that need to be verified with a "trusted 
authority" before used (more complicated, and if you are a realist, 
there are no "trusted authorities"-- yet).

Last time I created such a system with a view-action execution system 
with user and group permissions it took me about 80 hours to really work 
the bugs out and create all the admin interfaces and everything. That's 
assuming you'll want to be able to control which modules are executed by 
whom from within the web-based admin tools. You could probably do a 
half-assed version within 10 hours.

At $25/hr you're not leaving much breathing room if/when they drag this 
project on, creep beyond scope, change requirements, etc. I think the 
"lets see what can be taken away" idea was fantastic. Also, be careful 
not to work with them too much developing a plan - they could just pass 
that along to the rentacoder types.

If you really want you could make a generic version of the system, and 
when it's done offer to liscense it to them and customize it for them. 
They'll get an exclusive in their industry.

Nope, but ADOdb does include an XML-based schema/data manipulation addon 
called AXMLS.

Perhaps a different approach, but practically the same result.

Hey Folks,

I have a javascript issue that I'm about to get into, and I just wanted to run it by you guys to see if anyone has solved this before, 
or perhaps has a good idea about approaching it.

I have a standard looking interface with left bar navigation and the "meat" (forms) in the middle.  What I need to do is the following:

If the user makes any changes to the form, and then clicks somewhere on the left nav bar without first clicking 
the "save" (or cancel) button at the bottom, I need them to confirm that they'd like to discard or save their changes and 
leave that page.

I don't believe the actions that will occur afterwards will be a problem, but I'm not quite positive on how to implement the form check 
in the first place.  I would like it be "general", so that it is not dependent on the elements in the form, but rather the form as a
whole.  I was thinking that I could perhaps, when building the page, create a "dynamic" JS function that had all the existing values, and
then on unLoad, check them against the current values.  Or, maybe I could create a form object, and just do a simple comparison against
the current form object - I'm not sure about that one.

Any thoughts or comments are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom

Call me a cynic, but whenever I see something like :

"Hey competition, please tell me your pricing and proposal ideas so I 
can optimally underbid you" all sorts of red flags go up.

If you are at a business maturity level such that you need to post a 
question like that to an open PHP list, you would be wise to get a job 
working for an established shop for a while longer - you need the 
experience. NYPHP'ers would be serving the talk list well by only 
responding to such posts offline.

Start reading up on DAO (Data Access Objects) and Data Objects.  These
patterns are somewhat similar to what you're looking for.  I've attempted
building a hugely robust DAO system that completely replicates a database
(including field types, lengths, defaults, etc), which even goes to the
lengths of automagically validating and/or formatting the data whenever
insert/updated, grabbing the default data when selecting for a form, and
allowing you create fields of 'special' data types (i.e. email: VARCHAR 120,
with email regex attached).  At the end of the day, I just like SQL better.
Although I do use DAO for larger projects to maintain organization, SQL is
so powerful and customizable , and tends to be far more efficient in
comparison to the overhead using objects for data access can carry. And I've
years of experience with complex SQL, which makes it tons faster for me at
dev time.
 
Good Luck!

Anyone here ever seen a class that can resemble a dataset?
 
here is what i would like to do, create a class that will take and SQL
query/command and execute it but also get all the table info such as row
name and value and store it in the object, i can then be disconnected from
the DB, add/edit/delete from the dataset and then run an update command to
update the actual database, i think having things like this would make the
site a bit faster as i wouldnt have so many db connections for each user
session.
 
I have found WebPanels (http://tanus.dotgeek.org) but that seems a bit more
complex in the OOP area for me.

Try PEAR's DB_DataObject.  I don't know all about it but I have a feeling 
it's along the lines you're looking for.

How are people going to learn if they don't get any advice? I'm not 
trying to bid against anyone here so I have no interest in hiding 
anything from anyone. Posting off-list is even worse because it requires 
people ask the same question when they want an answer. Post your 
questions and answers where everyone can see them, archieving them 
somewhere Google can index them, and you help more people and require 
questions to be repeated less often.

The question itself is a bit naive as of course the cost depends largely 
on the time it takes to produce the product and the time needed depends 
on the individual features and the ability of the programmer. However, 
given responses by several different people it's possible to work out an 
average. If you take significantly longer than the average then you 
probably need the experience anyway so you may as well charge the lower 
rate per hour. I see no reason that programmers with less experience 
shouldn't do freelance work. Freelancing is a good way to work on a wide 
range of applications which you often wouldn't be exposed to while 
working for an individual shop. Besides, estimating development time can 
be difficult even for experienced pros. Anyone that's worked in the 
software development business knows how seldom projects actually run 
according to schedule.

Would you really want this? i mean it will index everything including the
email addresses etc... in signitures and could cause spam.

A lot of mailing lists obscure the email addresses in their archieves. 
Often in such a way that human readers can figure out the real email 
address but not email bots.

It's certainly a good idea for all useful information to be indexed by 
Google and that includes mailing list discussions IMO. I've learned lots 
by such discussions and am often thanked by people for making sure 
answers to various problems were published on appropiate lists that I 
knew would be indexed. I go out of way to post such useful bits for 
Google to find even if I just figured out the answer for myself and 
nobody else has actually asked.

As far as email addresses in your sig.. well if you don't want spam then 
don't post your email address to places where you don't know who'll see 
it.. such as mailing lists. For myself I don't care. Spam doesn't really 
bother me much as my filters catch almost all of it. It's easy enough to 
use a different account for each mailing list you're on in case spam is 
a concern for you. Then if it gets to be to much you can just kill the 
address and resubscribe from a different address.

I've been toying for a while with opening a free (and ad free) server 
for geek user groups. Such that they'd provide easy to use tools for 
setting up a web site, mailing lists, and web-based mailing list 
archieve. I also thought about making it so people would have easy to 
use tools for creating/destroying multiple email account forwards. For 
those people who don't have their own email servers and don't want to 
use webmail accounts. Allow outgoing mail on those accounts and forward 
incoming mail to those accounts to some other email address. That should 
help manage the spam problem.

If you are at a business maturity level such that you need to post a

PHP programming, while mailman and sendmail have anything to do with

I had assumed that the phrase "From development with..." had an 
understood "PHP" between "From" and "development", but maybe that needs 
to be clarified. Or maybe I need to be clarified (mmm...butter) if it 
doesn't.

It's easy enough to delete off-topic posts/threads, but I would 
certainly prefer that the "official wisdom" about what is and isn't OT 
indicate that questions that have nothing at all to do with PHP are OT.

E.g.

On topic:

"I am using Mercury/32 MTA on Windows and when I call mail() from my PHP 
script, nothing happens." Subsequent discussion about MTA configuration 
and PHP configuration.

Off topic:

"I am using Mercury/32 MTA on Windows and I want it to deliver incoming 
mail to six different mailboxes."

maybe we should all agree to not respond to OT posts and call it out
sooner once an OT thread starts.

maybe this can be done automatically with a PHP script?

I'm rolling my own broadcast emailer and now that I've already put in way
too many hours on it, I thought I'd check in and see if people think this
overall design is sound.

It's a two-page form. Page one presents them with a form for the body,
subject, and a select menu to choose whether to send this message to
everybody in this MySQL database or just a subset. There's some
validation, then page two lets them proof it, and they can click either
Send to send it (duh!), or Edit to step back to page one.

When they click Send -- this is the part that I think merits some thinking
-- I've decided to do a sort of poor man's fork. That is, I write the
message body to a temporary file; then I execute myself with an exec()
call with args $to, $subject, $message_filename and redirect any output to
/dev/null; then I say "see ya later" to the browser.

If I'm in CLI mode, I open the message file, to do the db query, loop
through the result sending mail with PEAR::Mail/sendmail, and log some
things along the way, then email a report to the user.

This will be on a shared server. To keep Evil Spammer from getting a hold
of it, I will be in cgi-wrapped mode with execute permissions set to only
me. And the web interface will require authentication of course.

My reasoning is that if it takes a long time to send all those emails, I
don't want the user sitting there waiting and having the ability to hit
reload or otherwise mess up the process once it's under way. My
understanding is that if exec() doesn't produce any output, then PHP does
not hang around and wait for the exec'd process to finish, but rather
continues execution right away, which is exactly what I want.

Make sense?

Thanks,

If you're able to in your shared server environment and you(r users) can 
stand a few minute delay perhaps after they click "Send" you could do it 
this way: have the web page save info about who gets sent what to the 
db. Then every 3/5/10/whatever minutes, have cron run a process that 
scans the db for messages to be sent, sends them, and then updates the 
db with log info. No submit button delays for the user, you don't have 
to worry about cgi-wrapping, and you still get all the nice log info to use.

Your ISP will also appreciate your batching the send requests and 
scheduling the actual sends. You will be able to accommodate all sorts 
of unexpected events, and do your own logging. You may also want to 
build-in some checks along the way, based on constants you can adust as 
you see fit (based on growth, usage patterns, or whatever) - for 
example, at cron time if #pending > X (expected max usage) then pause 
process and alert you, if pending headers are not as expected, pause and 
alert,  (you wrote the header, so your regex should confirm it matches 
at send time), send max Y messages per hour, etc etc. Build in the 
controls now and you will be less sorry later when it gets hijacked or 
your ISP has a system-level emergency, or a user makes a mistake or you 
decide to add restrictions or you go over bandwidth budget or whatever.

Unless absolutely necessary, IMHO best not to just pass control commands 
from user-acceeible script to system level process. Why set up a trust 
when you don't need to?

Just as an aside, it's possible to fork a detached php process, all you need to do is turn off stdin and stdout (and you should trap output/errors to a log):

exec("/path/to/php /your/script.php 2>>/your/logfile.log >&- <&- >>/your/logfile.log");

Thanks everybody, this is all good stuff to think about.

I think saving to a db and using cron might be overkill because this isn't
something that's gonna happen more than once every few days, and at
irregular intervals, and it isn't going to be more than maybe 150, 200
emails at one shot, at least not in the forseeable future.

But I asked for advice and sound advice is what I got, in terms of
efficiency, security and (oh no, the S-word) scaleability, so thanks
again.

That's what I'm doing (I think). Although -- correct me if I'm wrong -- I
believe technically that ain't true forking, as in pcntl_fork().

I'm a total forkin' newbie, but I've read that with "real" forking, the OS
will make two identical copies of address spaces, one for the parent and
the other for the child. If parent has set $foo = 7 prior to the fork, the
child would see $foo = 7 as well.  Whereas in this example, we're just
launching another independent instance of ourself, and as such we start
with a clean slate.

True?

I'm not a forkin' expert.. but on one host I did have a problem using the technique I described, and ended up having to force a "clean" environment by wrapping the whole thing in an env:

exec("env -i /path/to/php /your/script.php 2>>/your/logfile.log >&- <&- >>/your/logfile.log");

so something "bad" was being inherited by the process...

Hmmm, by some not-so-funny coincidence I've been going nucking futs trying
to fork on this of host of mine, too. I tried something closer to your
verbiage and it was better -- I forked, or pseudo-forked, or whatever --
but instead of returning right away, my test that slept for 15 seconds
seemed to sleep for a good... 15 seconds! Gonna try some other approach.
Sometimes your mileage really does vary quite a bit. Thanks.

in my case, the "dirty" environment seemed to be inherited from Apache (v 2.0.48)... that might be a place to look.

Hey Folks,

Is there an equivalent to the Perl Bit-Vector package in PHP?

I searched through this list, and the web, without much luck.

If not, anyone have any classes they are using to flip bits?

Thanks,

Hi Tom,

I'm not familiar with Perl's Bit-Vector package, but why not just use 
simple bitwise operators?
http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.bitwise.php

Do you need more than 32 bits?

For flipping bits - why not just XOR the vector with ones ?

I've never had to use real forks in PHP thought I have in Perl.
Using the PHP exec command doesn't do "real" forking, it just creates a 
new process in the background.
If you want real forking use the pcntl_fork command.
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php
The user comments are helpful

Hi Ophir,

Thanks for the response.

Yes, I need more than 32 bits. :-(

Worst case, I'll just shell-exec to a Perl program, but I just wanted to see
if anyone had any other ideas.

GMP allows arbitrary-length integers and supports logical
operations. I bet you could write some nice wrappers around that.

How do you think that new process is created?  PHP does:

if(fork() == 0) {
   execve(newProcessExecutable, argv, envp);
}

That's how you create a new process in UNIX systems programming.

Speaking of one of those comments (the one by me in particular).
That drove me insane for a long time, that comment will help save you a
"lot" of grief dealing with zombies that are generated by just following
the basic function reference.

I investigated pcntl_fork() and friends, and read:

"Process Control should not be enabled within a webserver environment and
unexpected results may happen if any Process Control functions are used
within a webserver environment."

...and indeed it isn't enabled on my host.

(Meanwhile I'm coming up with what I believe to me a serviceable solution
to my mini-broadcast email thing: ask them not to abort the process by
hitting back or reload etc; set max_execution_time to 0;  send all the
emails while printing progress info to the screen and flush()ing;  then
output some javascrap that redirects them to a confirmation page
(apologies to Dan C. (-: )).

Hi all:
I am building a free service, project at http://historyagent.com/ 
It is primarily geared for the Firefox browser but obviously would like
it work in all browsers.

Couple questions:

I am currently working with a browsercam free account to do the
compatibility issues. Anyone have any experience with other browser
tester sites?

I know this is a common issue..

Also will be adding in rdf/rss/atom/js feeds per user today and was
wondering if some people wanted to be a lab rats?

Thanks

Hi All,

I was wondering what resources (sites, mailing lists, ezines, magazines, 
etc) other people use to read PHP related articles and know what's 
happening the PHP world.

There is a nice list at http://www.php.net/links.php but I really wanted 
to know other people's opinions on what's good and what's not.

Thanx,
Ophir

Mostly due to time constraints, I find my PHP info in my rss sidebar far
more than I do in my bookmarks...

PHPDelevloper         http://www.phpdeveloper.org/ (worth a daily visit for
day-to-day php news)

And despite the high subscription price, I try to make time for PHP|Arch and
PHPMag every month.

AS far as general sites, 
Zend       http://www.zend.com/developers.php
the manual http://www.php.net
SitePoint  http://www.sitepoint.com (advanced forums have tons of in-depth
oo conversation)
DevShed    http://www.devshed.com/ (good general resource - beyond php as
well)

And of course this list and all the people I've met here and elsewhere who
tend to have good, solid answers no matter how rare the question.

Howdy Listies,

I want to run a PHP file through the PHP interpreter and return the results
as a string. THe File is not necessarily under docroot, so I've used this:

ob_start();
@include($path_to_file);
$contents = ob_get_clean();

But it seems like I could do this much more elegantly...

Any suggestions?

Then you definitely need these two, as they are RSS feeds of other RSS 
feeds ;-)

    PlanetPHP (blogs from prominent PHP folks):  http://www.planet-php.net/
    F/OSS Planet (more than just PHP):   http://osplanet.osdir.com/

These two can fill up those sidebars nicely.  :D

If you have allow_url_fopen disabled, include('http://evil.com/evil.php')
will fail, right?

allow_url_fopen is a system level configuration 
directive and can only be set or unset in php.ini.
(you can't undo the setting dynamically at runtime for 
security reasons)

To keep out 'evil.php' you would have to 
disallow opening url's anywhere -- if you go 
that route.

Like many security 'fixes', this cure 
strikes me as worse than the illness.
(I think it would certainly put a damper 
on using pcoms for instance)

I believe you are taking a 'blacklist' 
approach -- trying to make sure an 
'evil.php' doesn't affect you.

You might be better off to take 
a 'whitelist' approach like the ones  
Chris Shiflett speaks about from time 
to time in his security workshops.

I am under complete control of $path_to_file -- AND it will likely point to
a file outside of docroot.

So, besides the potential injection problems of the above code, any other
way to parse a PHP file and return as a string?

If you put a return value in the file it will be returned by the include 
call.

From: http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php

Handling Returns: It is possible to execute a return()  statement inside 
an included file in order to terminate processing in that file and 
return to the script which called it. Also, it's possible to return 
values from included files. You can take the value of the include call 
as you would a normal function. This is not, however, possible when 
including remote files unless the output of the remote file has valid 
PHP start and end tags (as with any local file). You can declare the 
needed variables within those tags and they will be introduced at 
whichever point the file was included.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR files not in directory I expected
Message-ID: <20040819175652.GA23185@ncc.edu>

Folks:
I'm trying to use some PEAR stuff for the first time on this
particular server.  The include path in the php.ini is, as I expected,
/usr/share/pear.  That directory exists, but has very few files in it.
After a find for QuickForm.php, I noticed it's in /usr/local/lib/php/.
Should I move the files, make a symlink, change my include path,
re-install PEAR, or something else?  The server's running Debian
stable, and I have root access.

TIA,
-c

What's hard about what Scott said?  Here's an example...

---- test.inc ----
<?php
$a = 5;
return $a;

---- test.php ----
<?php
$y = require_once './test.inc';
echo $y;

The file that I want to include is a big old PHP script with a lot of logic
in it that I don't want to bother collecting into a return value. There's a
lot of echo's sprinkled throughout the code that I would have to change...
concat them into a single return var...

You should probably try and determine 
if the registry is good or not.

I would look for a file called pear.ini.
If you find it change to that directory and 
see if you can run the pear script: 'pear help' 
and then pear 'package-dependencies Pear'.
(you could try some more commands -- 
list-upgrades might be a good one to try) 

If things look good, you could just add on 
the directory to your include description.

I realize that's what the docs say, yet interestingly enough, I can
ini_set this value on at least one of the hosts I use.

<?php
echo "Current value: " ;
echo  ini_get('allow_url_fopen')  ?  'enabled' : 'disabled' ;
ini_set('allow_url_fopen',1);
echo " ....and now:  ";
echo ini_get('allow_url_fopen')  ?  'enabled' : 'disabled' ;
phpinfo();
?>

Ouput:

Current value: disabled ....now: enabled

Followed by our phpinfo which says allow_url_fopen: master value off,
local value on. (PHP 4.3.4 running as an Apache 1.3.29 module)

Your clients are running a version 4 point releases and nearly a year 
old.  You should upgrade, for the sake of this security issue as well 
as others.

George

p.s. the issue you describe was fixed in 4.3.5, over half a year ago.

to be PHP_INI_SYSTEM. (Sara)

Oh my. Thanks for the enlightenment. I think these guys (pair Networks)
are running the version they're running for reasons of their own other
than laziness/cluelessness, but who knows.

Their customer newsletter recently said, hey, we are now setting
allow_url_fopen = off in our php.ini (because of all the carelessly
written stuff that had been hacked on their servers), so if you need it,
you better ini_set()  it yourself.

I guess whenever they do upgrade, and if they do keep that setting, I can
either run in CGI mode and write my own damn php.ini, or use cURL. Or...
what would you suggest, if you need to go out and fetch a web page
somewhere once in a while?

Oops, reading again I see: "you should upgrade." Maybe I'll try compiling
my own 4.3.8 and using CGI mode.

You could try PEAR HTTP_Request.  The introduction section of the docs 
has an example about fetching and displaying a web page.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] AMP for Mac OS X
Message-ID: <E1BxxKL-0000HY-MU@forth.wsgurus.com>

Hi all,

I have to port a website onto a Mac powerbook, OS X panther. Client is 
going on vacation and wants to take his database with him in order to 
work on it without having to worry about internet connection. Since the 
site is already running on LAMP. I figured it would be easier to 
install php/mysql/apache on his notebook, than having to port it to 
something else.

Is there any package like XAMPP? A pakcage that would install 
apache/mysql/php for OS X. If not, I'd appreciate some guides/tutorials 
regarding this.

Thanks,
Nasir

Get that, and then get this:

   
http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=77&vid=531&category=

Of course, as a web developer you gotta have this too:

   
http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=60&vid=63&category=Developer%20Tools 


It will then look like this when done:

No problem, it's easy to miss with all those extensions :)

My faves are Web Developer, AdBlock, Sage and (RSS Sidebar).  Web 
Developer is awesome for checking and validating your output (and 
proposed layout changes!); and also the Speed Report is pretty keen for 
a quick look at the size of your layouts and content.  Neat how they 
also indicate whether the server is using gzip compression or not - 
saved my bacon a couple of times ;)

Oh, and if you are interested I have some killer default filters for 
AdBlock, and have very little problems with the extension.

allow_url_fopen is a pretty big security issue - it really heightens

I'd use cUrl.  Some people like the PEAR HTTP classes for this as well. 
  I think the important thing is that you actually have to consciously 
open a url, which I think is a good thing.

That would work,  You should encourage the Pair folks to upgrade as 
well.  4.3.4 is old now.

Ok Im not sure about the browser cam thing but ...

Is there anyway to rank/sort the views in the history?, example page viewed
20x's @ the top vs. stuff just viewed once @ the bottom.  I think that's
more like a feature request .. :-)

We're a Las Vegas based web services company specializing in business 
web sites and search engine optimization. We need some people with web 
development and web design skills. Both developers and designers will 
need to know, or be able to learn, basic optimization skills and 
incorporate those into any work they do for us. For the time being we'll 
consider telecomutting. We'd eventually like someone that lives in, or 
could move to, Las Vegas.

Our own web site is developed in PHP and Python with MySQL on Linux. We 
would like to find people that are also well versed in one or more other 
server-side technologies such as ASP, ColdFusion, Miva, and JSP as we 
often are called upon to make changes to our client's websites and we 
have no control over what technology they use. You must be able to work 
hands on or communicate required changes to our client's webmasters. 
Support will be as much of your job as development is.

We're also interested in designers. Flash, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, etc. We 
like cross-platform solutions that look good, are easy to use, and are 
optimization friendly.

Michael,

We have a job board where posts of this nature should be posted, 
http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs.  As well,  we have a 
policy concerning commercial posts.  The following is taken directly 
from NY PHP's charter:

----------------------------------------
Appropriate Use of Mailing Lists

The mailing lists of New York PHP may not be used to:

   1. promote any commercial activities unless that posting has received 
prior board approval, in which case the posting shall include the words 
"This posting has been approved by the Board of New York PHP";
   2. suggest that any activity, code base, or writing has been endorsed 
by or created by or supported by New York PHP if that is not the case.

The Board of New York PHP shall determine whether a violation of 
appropriate use has occurred, and if it has, the President shall issue a 
warning notice in writing to the violator.

Anyone who again violates appropriate use after having been already 
issued a warning notice shall be excluded from any and all participation 
in New York PHP.
----------------------------------------------


Your post has not been reviewed or approved by the Board at NYPHP.  
Please abide by the policies and procedures set fourth in the charter.  
The NY PHP charter can be reviewed at: 
http://www.nyphp.org/content/about/charter.php.

Thank you,
Hans Kaspersetz

I agree with the first point, but I don't follow the second one. Are you
considering the accidental inclusion of foreign source code to be a
cross-site scripting attack, or is there something I'm missing?

I would agree with you. I apologize for posting anything unwanted to the 
list but it's really quite unreasonable to expect people to remember 
charters for every single list they belong to. My experience has always 
been that many people appreciate on topic job postings so of course I 
didn't imagine it'd cause a problem by submitting such a posting. I'll 
try to remember not to submit such postings here in the future.

When I have posted something objectionable 
to various lists in the past (typically 
inadvertently posting in HTML to a list 
that prefers plain text), I would sometimes 
receive an off-list note from a list member 
explaining to me my error. 

Nobody on the list wanted to be needlessly 
reminded of something they already knew -- 
that they would rather have plain text posts.

For what it's worth, I agree off-list mod is in general a more sensitive 
approach to maintaining order, and helps keeps S/N high.
However, given that this is a recent rule and not well known, I think 
Hans did the right thing reminding the list that commercial posts need 
to be approved. In this case I think Hans message was "signal" -- 
admittedly I can't say the same about *this follow up of mine*, 
soooooooo....

Now that the list has seen a commercial post that didn't have a 
"approved by the board" snippet, a prompt response from a NYPHP'er that 
such posts should be avoided, and a pretty consistent expressed desire 
by list members to follow rules, maintain some order and keep s/n high, 
let's move further discussion *about* the rules to the 
organizational/development/operational lists?

You can try here a very nice install package for OSX 
http://www.serverlogistics.com/software.php   To access the shell you 
can use the terminal app found /application/utilities/terminal.  There 
is no default login you will need the users admin that was created 
during OS install to sudo.  Check the user privileges in the system 
preferences accounts menu.  From the terminal you can just sudo once 
that is all configured properly.  Not much different from linux.

Try the Lower East Side Mac UNIX Users Group

or
http://www.macosxhints.com/
the answers to your questions are yes, but beyond the scope of this 
list. Especially try a search for "enable root" at Mac OS X Hints. -- 
Actually, try typing "enable root" into the Mac Help window. Also the 
shell is provided by a program called "Terminal" in the 
/Applications/Utilities folder.

The fact that it is a recent rule doesn't excuse the misapplication of it.
Letting someone know that we have a jobs list is great, and that's all
that needs to be said.

Even PHP-General allows job postings, and it's the largest PHP mailing
list in the world.

> Now that the list has seen a commercial post that didn't have a 
> "approved by the board" snippet

Did you read the email? Seriously, I can't imagine that the "commercial"
bit in the charter was intended to address some growing problem with
people not knowing we have a separate jobs list. If this were an email
from someone using the list as an advertising platform, then I would agree
that it is a misuse of the list, and I also think the poster would know
that intuitively.

Anyway, sorry for being the bad guy, but I felt something needed to be
said. I perceived a bit of a "holier than thou" attitude being projected
toward someone using us to locate PHP talent, and I don't want to be a
part of that. I *want* people to use NYPHP's resources to find PHP talent,
and I appreciate those who do. It makes our group stronger and more
valuable to the members and to the community.

I would like to follow-up with my post last night and put this to rest. 
My post last night was insensitive. It was late and I did not take the 
time to make my response diplomatic. I purely stated what the guidelines 
are and where the community can go to review them.

My intention was to let the user know there is another list for this 
purpose and that there are guidelines that prompted my response. I try 
and make it a habit not to offer guidance unless I can offer a reference 
to back it up. I also try and not operate on pure opinion when offering 
that guidance.

As John stated, the guidelines I refereed to are relatively new. 
Normally, an off list mod is the way to go but I responded on list to 
raise the awareness of the guidelines. I did not state that he would be 
prohibited from posting after review. I just stated that posts that are 
commercial in nature should be reviewed by the board.

I am not trying to come off "holier than thou"; my intention was to 
raise awareness on two fronts, that's it. I agree with Chris that being 
an accessible resource does make the community stronger. In the same 
breath, it is the community member?s social responsibility to be aware 
of the community's guidelines. I hope we can close this discussion and 
move on. Please accept my apology for my lack of sensitivity. I do not 
intend to drive anyone away.

Respectfully,
Hans K

Well, I acknowledge that Chris and I tend to disagree on commercialism 
of free resources like this talk list.

Back in the late eighties when newsgroups first started getting spammed 
by people with 10 line signatures, the general agreement was that 3 
lines is enough to sign your post. Anything more is spam. Even though 
the Internet is no longer non-commercial, I still agree with that 
sentiment. How many lines of hyperlinks to external resources do we 
really need on every post to bleed the signal to noise ratio of the 
list? Do we need board approval to spam this list in the sig?

I admit I am on the outer edge, but I also don't write off commercial 
posts as "job opportunities". Case in point is this one. A job 
opportunity post is "I have PHP jobs available. Requirements are A,B, 
and C. Click here for more....."   A commercial post is "My company does 
X and Y, is a leader in the field, is growing and very successful, etc 
etc etc and has jobs "....  Most people in the marketing business know 
the value of such a post with external links, placed on a quality 
PHP-oriented webpage or list,  for PR and marketing purposes (in 
addition to back-linking and search engine relevance). Internet 
marketing 101 espouses the importance of such PR. Wiki-spam, guestbook 
spam, blog comment spam.... it's all trying to do the same thing.

My apologies to Michael who posted the original job *advertisement*. I 
never doubted his intentions, but he has sparked the discussion so may 
feel a bit persecuted. He's also a self-proclaimed SEO person, so I 
expect he understands very well the value of such exposure.

Someone has to protect resources that are intended to be free, and 
intended to be high signal to noise, and NOT intended to be marketing 
vehicles for commercial enterprises (including book authors). I suggest 
it get done through a sensitive board of directors and off-line mods, 
like Hans K was doing voluntarily with his free time between 3 and 3:30 
am or whatever. Do we sell less PHP books? yeah, probably. Do we risk 
losing some opportunity to promote PHP via such spam? yeah... but that's 
the job of the Board of Directors, isn't it? I bet NYPHP's Board of 
Directors will do a wonderful job of approving what is good and limiting 
what is questionable, if they are granted that opportunity. I doubt 
anyone is more qualified than they are. They provide a jobs list, and 
apparently would tolerate a jobs post that didn't appear to take 
advantage of the commercial potential of the list.

Now by atempting to prevent over commercialization and spamming of the 
list do we lose the participants who make NTPHP's lists such a valuable 
resource? I guess that is up to those people, who have to decide for 
themselves if participation in the list, sans any direct commercial 
benefit, is still worthwhile to them. I couldn't tell you that one. I 
highlight, however, that we also risk losing the same people when the 
list becomes low signal to noise, or overly spammed. In my experience 
the lurking experts are at least as valuable as the high-profile ones, 
but sadly they are also the first to leave when the list gets too noisy.

Finally, I am just a participant in NYPHP and this list, like everybody 
else. I have no agenda, and don't represent the board of NYPHP or 
anything like that. So while I know I am not wrong in my understanding 
of how people commercialize these resources, I may be wrong about how 
NYPHP desires to handle these issues. Like most of you, I have simply 
contributed my piece.

I do understand that value. I also must point out though that I did not 
include a url at all to the business. I didn't even use my business 
email address. The only url I posted was in my usual sig and goes to my 
own personal website.

FYI, the company I work for doesn't spam mailing lists, wikis, or any of 
those bad practices you mentioned. I understand your concern about such 
abuse but I hardly think posting a job advert such as I did would fall 
into that category. We do take advantage of such resources to create 
sponsorship links to our clients but we do it in what I feel is the 
legit way - we either create the resource ourselves and put the links 
where appropiate or we make deals with the websites involved to pay them 
a sponsorship fee to include our text links on their pages. If it was my 
intention to get links from your site that is the method I would use. 
Again, I apologize for any trouble my job posting made.

Someone mentioned a list for non-technical discussion on these topics. 
What is the address for that list? Thanks.

I'm beginning a large php project and want to use one of the big documenting
coding standards. Any thoughts on the documentation software would be much
appreciated.

phpDocumentor looks more popularly used and accepted but PHPDoc claims to be
a port of JAVADoc which is the standard in the JAVA world.

Thanks in advance,

Hey Eddie:

PHPDoc buggy and no longer being developed.  phpDocumentor is under 
active development and has tremendous features beyond PHPDoc.

Forget the argument about Javadoc.  Since PHPDoc is a port of Javadoc 
and phpDocumentor is a port of PHPDoc, phpDocumentor is a port of 
Javadoc.

I recommend phpDocumentor.  I think it also follows the JavaDoc documentation
standard?  It features a templating layer with Smarty support as well as an
option to output to PDF.  It really is a great idea to internally 
document your
code; this discipline will pay off down the road.

Regards,
Brian

I suppose it was only a matter of time.

Of course this *could* (although unlikely) have an effect on various
session handling mechanisms, since they are typically MD5 hashes.

An interesting project would be to see if two UNIX timestamps exist that
produce the same MD5.

Well, are you considering a UNIX timestamp to be any positive integer? :-)
If so, there are definitely collisions somewhere, because there are more
inputs than possible outputs.

I've always heard the top crypto guys saying that MD5 was weaker than
people thought; I guess they were right. Still, I wouldn't mind seeing one
of these experts comment on whether it is dangerous to be using MD5 for
passwords and such.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Parsing Fun
Message-ID: <20040823034128.61193A85F3@virtu.nyphp.org>

I have been experimenting with parsing, as I am, and have always been
(regardless of the programming language) in the dark on exactly how I should
be going about parsing a text file. I have always kept it simple with easy
explodes and the like, but it is getting to the point where I want to have a
smarter script that doesn't need a finite list of things that must come in a
certain order, etc. So, to that end, I have been experimenting with parsing
some RSS streams (I am using the Reuters Sports Stream at
http://www.microsite.reuters.com/rss/sportsNews as a guinea pig). I thought
that for this end, sscanf would be really easy - I basically got the
position of two tags I wanted to read in between with strpos, used substr to
truncate the string, and then attempted to use sscanf to parse it into neat
little variables. The problem I ran into is that sscanf doesn't really like
white spaces, and it stops reading at that point. So, I dug around a little
and found that someone had used %[^[]] to match everything - but at this
point, sscanf stopped following my handy little outline.

 

So, this is more of a request for some general direction in gaining some
parsing skills - I am sure there are some out there with some weaker skills
who could use the brush up as well. 

 

Thanks,

I always enjoy parsing (really). IMHO string manipulation is what made 
Professional Basic the success it was (PBDS, a loong time ago) and what 
sold me on PHP as a general-purpose scripting language and not just a 
way to access HTTP headers.

Tokenizing is always fun (strtok). file_get_contents is very handy for 
use with PHP string functions, especially tokenizing. I never cared much 
for "exploding" or "splitting". Nothing like a deep, nested loops of 
str_stuff and preg_replace to get the brain cells working in the morning 
or in other words, to burn up your morning hours!)

Seriously though, with PHP I have found it is wise to try and use the 
built in parsers when possible, such as parse_url, but *never 
underestimate the amazing power of the preg_replace_callback*.

In your example, wouldn't preg_match(all) be a better choice than 
sscanf, so you can explicitly handle tabs and whitespace? That'd give 
you an array of all tagged content appearing in your file (in case there 
was more than the one you expected ;-) which you can further 
parse-n-store using str_"stuff" as you like?

Of course the danger isn't in a collision - collisions exist by 
definition as part of a hashing system.  The danger is in being able to 
generate a collision for an arbitrary input, as this would render the 
'fingerprinting' aspect of the scheme useless.  This isn't part of the 
result, but the general worry is that such a result will follow.

You might try looking at 
http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/ 

and following some of the links on that page.

It works with PHP version 4.3.2  
and uses the expat parser

I can't think of any place in particular, but the cheapest option would 
probably be to park in a garage or on the street on the far east or west 
side of 57th Street and hop on the M-57 bus or walk from there for 15-20 
mins.

I'd recommend checking rates at the garage on the north side of 56th 
between 5th and 6th first and deciding from there.

I added [OT] to the subject, since that seems appropriate. However, this
discussion seems very relevant to the list, even if it is off-topic. :-)

> CVS: http://cvshome.org/

I think Subversion is better in terms of features, but if I had to choose
a version control system right now, I'd still go with CVS. It's more
familiar to most developers, there is more documentation, CVS clients are
packaged with most operating systems, it's been around longer, etc.

I think this discussion is similar to choosing a PHP compiler cache,
though. The difference between using one versus not using one is huge,
whereas the differences between them are minor. So, use a version control
system, whichever you decide. :-)

I wrongfully thought I had 'til 3:00pm today to RSVP, but I see from the online RSVP that it's 3:00pm yesterday.

I really want to attend but waited til the last minute to RSVP because I wasn't sure I was going to be able to attend.

If you're trying to engage in "social engineering," it wouldn't hurt

Hey... my level of PHP is ok, I don't do a heck of a lot of it
on a daily basis, but I can usually get what I need from it.

I just finished working on a development project creating
charts with data from a MySQL database using the GD 2.0
libraries. However, the database where this will be implemented
is Oracle 9i. I have access to it remotely, from my
workstation, but I've only been able to connect via a shell...
not using PHP.

I am hosting the .php files locally for testing, since I had to
compile my own version of PHP 5 with the graphic libraries, and
OCI8 support. However, the database is on port 1601, and I
haven't been able to get a connection to return any data yet.

... any help would be appreciated. And, I'm sure I'd need to
give more information, but I'm not sure what you'd need to help
though... so, ask away.

Thanks.

I've never used Oracle with or without PHP, but are you sure your copy
of PHP (or the Web server that's running it) runs in an environment
where all the necessary Oracle environment variables have been set?

See http://www.php.net/oci8 for more information.

I can tell you've done this for your account, but I'm not sure you've
done the same for the user Apache is running as.

Yea... pretty certain. We had tried to setup the dev Oracle
environment too... (on Mac OS X) but it was getting too
complicated, and I was able to access the db remotely... and
since I had configured PHP with the Oracle libraries that *did*
get installed... things should be ok.  We seemed to have some
issues, possibly, with the Apache setup. I had to add the
following to the apachectl binary file...

ORACLE_HOME=/Users/oracle/Source/9iR2
export ORACLE_HOME
TNS_ADMIN=/Users/oracle/Source/9iR2/network/admin
export TNS_ADMIN

... we get some kind of connection, but the query seems to be
*stuck*.

Thanks... we'll be keep on rollin' here.

Hi Nathan:

I'm running Oracle 9i on a Windows 2000 machine and connecting to it 
via PHP w/o problems.

I uncommented this line in the php.ini files:
    extension=php_oci8.dll

I'm using PEAR DB as my API.  My DSN for that is:
    oci8://user:passwd@/db

Which translates into a PHP connect method of:
   OCILogon(user,passwd,);

If I read your posts correcly, your scritps are on your development 
server and your Oracle instance is on a different server you're 
accessing via the internet.  So, my experience above doesn't exactly 
apply.

Perhaps there's a firewall keeping you out?  Perhaps Oracle isn't 
configured to allow connections from your machine, let alone any other 
machine?  You're using the oci8 extension, right?

... thanks Daniel.

Actually, there were 2 instances of the Oracle connection on my local 
machine, and this was sort of screwing up the PHP connection. You've 
got it down now... but, I can't really explain how. We did modify the 
apachectl binary to include the Oracle environments, but, I'm not even 
sure that did anything... weird. i do not recommend the setup!

Thanks.

Jay, and the group,
 
Most people (I've seen the figure of 85%) use IE, and that's why I develop for it.  Am I wrong to have the understanding that only Netscape (using the Mozilla engine) can display the WUL programming?  I'm working on a PHP/MySQL site where the no refresh feature would be useful, but again, it will have to be cross-browser, or it would mean I'd have to develop two sites, one for IE and one for Netscape.
 
Hey, guys, be gentle if I'm a bit confused here...

XUL is natively implemented in all Mozilla-derived browsers (Mozilla, 
Firefox, Camino, etc.) - but Jay did mention that there were several 
plugins available for providing XUL capability to Explorer.  Jay, could 
you provide the color commentary on these?

I've been researching something just like this for a project that I am 
working on, and it really does look that your choices for such an 
interface boil down to XUL or Flash (gasp!).  Flash has some significant 
eccentricities that would probably limit its effectiveness for building 
a really complex interface.

So I am also very interested in XUL, and looking forward to Jay's source 
download (hint, hint)

I'm not sure if it matters (I haven't done any testing), but Safari is
based on Konqueror, not Mozilla.

Here's how I nutshell Xul's place in the world:

*You would use XUL where you would have used HTML. So you can use Xul 
(page coding) with CSS (for stylin) and js (for action).
*Xul gives you more features than HTML; some of the features you used to 
embed large js scripts to get
*If you make web sites, you won't want to replace your HTML with Xul 
unless you want to limit your website to Gecko-only visitors.
*Xul runs in Gecko. Think of it as an application language, not a 
website coding language. What does that mean?

Let's say an application is a collection of pages which must share 
common "memory" --kinda like they need access to a collection of 
variables at all times. HTTP is called "stateless" because the server 
only knows the client web browser when a page is requested. Between page 
requests, the server doesn't keep any "memory" of that browser client. 
That is why any variables that must be "remembered" between pages have 
to be passed as hidden vars, or stuffed into session cookies, or written 
to a file. An "application" requires state -- the more vars you are 
passing around between your pages inorder to make your website function, 
the more your web project is starting to look like a web "application".

But if you write an *application*, you will start needing features like 
instance-programmable pop-down menus, which you will have to go to java, 
js or ActiveX to get (browser compatibility problems there as well). In 
your application you need alot of access to your variables, so you will 
find yourself going back and forth to the server alot. You will struggle 
with GET vs. POST because sometimes you need to pass vars but can't 
restrict the order in which a multi-part form is to be completed, for 
example. In fact, sometimes only some parts of a multi-part form are 
needed, based on what the user has already entered. That will require 
another hit to the server, for each examination of entered data -- 
unless you decide to use js.... or Xul. Get it?  It becomes difficult to 
make an "application" out of a string of web pages.... and Xul provides 
a means to do multipart screens without excessive refreshes to the 
server, and less dependence on the use of sessions/cookies/hidden 
vars/and all the other techniques of coping with a "stateless" HTTP 
protocol.

Xul lessens your dependence on complex js, by enriching the features 
available inside the page description language (which was HTML and is in 
this case Xul). It does so only for Gecko browsers.

Message-ID: <412DE482.1040703@r2communications.com>

I am building an application as an exercise in moving from procedural 
programming to OOP.

I have the following classes...

class_display.php
class_validator.php
class_client.php

What I would like to do is clean my code up a little. Within 
class_client and class_validator, I access and modify properties of 
class_display by declaring 'global $display.'

I don't think this is right, but I can't seem to find another way that 
works.

Code snippets are posted below. TIA.

//code for class_display

class Display {
	
	var $errors=false;
	var $errorM;
	var $success=false;
	var $successM;
	var $display=true;
	
	}

//code snippet from class_validator

class Validator {

	var $type;
	var $value;
	var $pass;

	function validateAlpha($value){
		$value=trim($value);
		$pass=preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z-]+$/', $value);
		return $pass;
		}

	}

//code snippet from class_client

class Client {

	function clientNameCheck($value){
		global $display;
		global $validator;
		$test=$validator->validateMixed($value);
		if(!$test){
			$display->errors=true;
			$this->clientNameEM='<p class="error">ERROR: Client name is not 
valid.</p>';
			return false;
			}
		}
	//begin add method
	function addClient(){
		
		//call to other classes
		global $conn;
		global $validator;
		global $display;

		//validate user input
		
		$this->clientNameCheck($this->clientName);
		}
	//end add method
	}

why not just do

class client extends display {
then you can use $this->displaymethod

Because class_client also accesses the methods of class_validator.

class_display controls whether or not the form is displayed. if there 
are errors, the form may or may not be displayed. if submission was 
successful, the form will not be displayed.

But in order to do error checking, it has to access class_validator to 
check the user input.

You need to make display and validator a member of the client class. 
Then you client class would look like this.

class Client {
     var $display;
     var $validator;
     var $conn;
     var $clientNameEM;
     var $clientName;

     function Client() {
         $this->display   =& new Display;
	$this->validator =& new Validator;
	$this->conn      =& new Conn; //Don't know where this comes from.
     }

     function clientNameCheck($value){

         $test = $this->validator->validateMixed($value);
         if(!$test){
             $this->display->errors = true;
             $this->clientNameEM = '<p class="error">ERROR: Client name 
is not valid.</p>';
             return false;
             }
         }
     //begin add method
     function addClient(){

         //validate user input

         $this->clientNameCheck($this->clientName);
         }
     //end add method
     }

OK, that makes sense. But how is it different, or better than what I'm 
doing now? On the surface, it appears that my current method may break 
in PHP 5. I'm currently using different versions of PHP 4.2+, but want 
to code it so that I won't have too much to change whenever I bump up to 5.

FYI, $conn is a call to my database connection.

And, just so I make sure I understand, each of my individual methods 
within client, which need to access class_display and class_validator, 
would need to include...

$this->display =& new Display
$this->validator =& new Validator

...right?

It is better because this allows each instance of client to have its own 
instance of display and validator. It will let each client display 
things they way they want without interfering with other client objects.

You method uses only one instance of the display and validator classes. 
If you had two instances of the client class you can't be sure that 
values display has because you don't know which client has modified it last.

No! The constructor (function Client()) is the only one that needs to do 
this. It is setting the members of the class so that they will be 
alvailable in _all_ methods of the class. Once $this->display is 
assigned you can use it in any method of the class.

OK, so I added the client() function, which acts as my constructor. 
Then, in my PHP page, I added...

$client->client();

... which sets everything up so that it can be used by the instance of 
the object, right?

I'm guessing so, since it's working.

You don't need to call the constructor explicitly. The constructor gets 
called automatically when you create the instance of the class.  All you 
need to do is use the new operator and it calls the constructor for you.

$client =& new Client;

What you did calls the constructor explicitly after the class is 
instantiated. If you did something to the class, that modified any of 
it's properties, between the time you instantiated it and the time you 
called the constructor explicitly you would loose any of those changes. 
For instance:

$client =& new Client;
$client->display->errors = true;
print_r($client);
$client->client();
print_r($client);

The output should show that even though you set errors to true it was 
reset to false when you called the constructor.  That is because it 
reassigned the display property with a new display object that had the 
defualt settings.

better yet, if you want to make things work with php5 as well, do this

class client {
  function client() {
    $this->__construct();
  }

  function __construct() {
    //constructor here
  }

}

This is unnecessary, as PHP 5 will "fallback" if it can't find a
constructor named __construct() upon the old PHP 4 style constructor
naming scheme.

But if you don't do it that way then you loose the whole point of 
__construct which is to be able to change the name of the class without 
having to change the name of all the calls to the parent constructor. If 
you don't know where you code will be running or what will happen to it 
in the future its probably better to throw in some redundancy.

Hi Susan and Mitch (and others),

Examples of these are XML interfaces provided through Flash (Lazlo
Systems) or through Java (Thinlet and jXUL).

Adam Lock (who previously worked for Netscape as part of the Mozilla team
before it was disbanded) has produced a Mozilla plugin for Internet
Explorer (IE). It installs the Mozilla engine (Gecko) as an ActiveX
control for IE. You can get it here:
http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/mozilla.htm

(Adam Lock also has a similarly-named, but different project for embedding
ActiveX controls inside of Mozilla.)

I should also point out that it is possible to create semi-rich web
applications using web services (XML-RPC / SOAP) and HTML and JavaScript.
Some people from NYPHP were nice enough to send me GMail invitations after
my presentation, and I got to try it out. It seems that GMail is taking
this approach, although I have not really inspected its code.

The deal with using HTML + JavaScript + web services for semi-rich web
applications is that you are still stuck with the rather inflexible HTML
widgets. For example, an HTML drop-down box's contents (<select> <option>
</option> </select>) cannot be edited directly. Mozilla provides an
attribute to turn on this feature (editable="true", or something like
that).

Additionally, some Mozilla widgets are designed to hold thousands of rows
of data. (Specifically, the column display widget used to display rows of
email titles in Thunderbird / Mozilla Mail).

If you think of an otherwise excellent traditional web application such as
Squirrelmail (webmail app using PHP), you will realize how much better it
would be if it had been implemented using something XUL-like. For example,
to page through rows of email titles, one would simple have to use the
scrollbar.

I think that if you want cross-browser compatibility for a rich or
semi-rich web application, you could go with a commercial Flash-based
product such as Lazlo System's presentation server or with a more
cross-browser-friendly HTML + JavaScript + Web Services approach.

XUL has many built-in niceties such as tabs, editable widgets, etc. which
have no direct HTML equivalents.

I think in its current state, XUL-based applications are ideal for
Intranet-based applications, and particularly for data-entry oriented
applications.

Often with data-entry oriented applications, one has to present many input
fields spread over many different "pages" / screens. Mozilla's tab or
wizard tags could come in handy here.

Also - with XUL + JS + Web Services + PHP / MySQL, once data is entered
and the Submit button pressed, the data can be passed back to the server,
and validation errors can be displayed using a JavaScript alert or by
highlighting a relevant field, all without the dreaded page-refresh. Thus
input validation can be done on the server (PHP) side, and the results of
that validation can be displayed on the client side.

Libraries such as PEAR's HTML_QuickForm provide separate validation logic
for the client and server sides. Even though this logic is automatically
generated, it is worth pointing out that with a rich web app using XUL,
this validation logic would only have to be written once (on the
server-side).
Thus validation logic could be "hidden" on the server-side, or use more
complex server-side information analysis (such as seeing if an entered zip
code is valid), yet intervene on the client-side.

I hope that all makes sense ...

- Jay

Hi Joel:

Getting back to this aging thread...

Keeping crackers out.

Thanks for your great advice.

I have a few questions...

* Does it matter what type of image is used?  I'd guess JPEG's lossy,
somewhat imprecise, nature would be a _little_ harder for bots to 
decipher.

* I'm using fuzzy fonts, but they may be a bit _too_ fuzzy for humans 
to easily figure out.  I'm pondering if it would be better to use 
cleaner fonts, but split each letter in half along a random axis and 
then move the two halves apart a little bit in a random direction.  
This would likely thwart attempts to use the font files to reverse 
engineer the characters.


Anyway here's my CAPTCHA implementation thusfar...

The source of the image generation is at:
http://cvs.php.net/co.php/pearweb/public_html/captcha-image.php

and the value generation is at the bottom of:
http://cvs.php.net/co.php/pearweb/include/pear-format-html.php

In order to allow testing before deployment, the code I posted doesn't
generate images on the form pages yet.  To see what the CAPTCHAs look
like, go to this page to initialize a captcha session var:
http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=14&edit=3

Then view the image here:
http://pear.php.net/captcha-help.php

Please let me know what you think.


> The main issue here with this one is the random line(s) and the opacity.

Opacity?  How would I tweak that for a particular object?  I didn't 
see any related functions in the php gd man page.  I am juggling 
colors, though.

Thanks,

--Dan

Forgive me if this has already been mentioned, but the reality is when
it comes to captcha there is really a very very low tech requirement for
them to be very effective, and going too much beyond that isn't going to
buy you very much. What I mean is, you can probably get away with a
text-based captcha (see the comment form on my blog at
http://www.coggeshall.org/)... Which is going to stop 99% of the people
in the world. If you are actually concerned, I wouldn't even worry about
someone doing OCR as its really not worth their time. Rather, if someone
is looking to do that they will setup a porn site and make people type
in the word they see in the box in order to see their porn and go that
route -- which is exactly what happens with Yahoo!

I installed it on a friends computer and now his Iomega CD Drive does not work.
The same CD drive that I installed SP2 from to begin with.

Contacted Iomega and they are clueless but said that others have contacted them
with the same problem and that they were looking into it.

Hey Jeff:

Sorry you're having headaches.

I've installed SP2 on a few machines without incident.

I handed out a CD at Tuesday's meeting containing SP2 and a bunch of 
other handy scripts and utilities.

For those who got that CD, I subsequently wrote a README file for the 
CD and a set of instructions for turning off unnecessary protocols.  
If you'd like those emailed to you, drop me a note directly (not via 
the mailing list).

For those that didn't get it, in addition to SP2, it most notably has 
the following two items:

IE60sp1-Tweak
    Improvements to Internet Explorer's security settings

XpPro-SecurityGuide
    Instructions and templates from Microsoft for 
    locking down Windows XP Professional.

XpPro-SecurityTemplates
    My scripts for automating the process of locking
    down Windows XP Professional.  These are based on
    the materials from Microsoft in the prior directory.

Xp-Tweaks
    Loads of adjustments to the Windows user interface
    that make things easier to use and a bit more secure.

Plus a bunch of good programs and utilities that are nice to have in 
one place.  If you'd like one, pop me an email off-list.

Agreed.  When the php.net bug system got comment spammed a month or so 
ago, I quickly set up a text based CAPTCHA system for pear.php.net.

As it turned out, Derrick said the attacker scraped the pages before 
submitting, which could have defeated a text based system.

Yep.  That's a clever workaround.  No security is impenetrable.

That reminds me, I wanted to add a time check to the system... (hack, 
hack, hack, commit).

Thanks,

what's wrong with you?  Dont you want to eat up all the bandwidth/time you
have sending that CD over the net :)

can't blame ya there i would require a snail mail addy too.

Shame, shame on me. They ~are~ running 4.3.8. Until moments ago I failed
to realize that I was reading the version info from my outdated php binary
that I was using for CGI mode.

I would keep my mouth shut and not embarrass myself, but being the
honorable sort, I thought I owed it to pair to fall on my sword and
correct the public record.

And yeah pair is the ones who provide bandwidth and hardware to PEAR.

btw thanks for the advice. I think I will use cURL.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Possible to send email to _specific_ exchange server?
Message-ID: <BD53DE11.48AF%maymaynyc@hotmail.com>

Hello all,

I have an interesting problem which I?m unable to solve on my own. I?m
hoping someone here can offer some help. This is my first post to the list,
but I?ve been lurking for a while and it seems that many brilliant and
generous minds post here.

Here?s my problem:

I?ve got a client with a tiny web site which I built for them. In it, I
included a contact form ? nothing fancy, just an HTML form to send mail() to
a specific address: me at sphgrp.com

The problem arose when I transferred the site from my server to theirs: they
have a shared web hosting plan provided by LunarPages.com with the domain
name sphgrp.com but they have their email accounts set up at Network
Solutions, Inc, also with the host name sphgrp.com.

This means that whenever PHP sends an email to me at sphgrp.com, it never
leaves LunarPages? network and instead of getting routed to the email
account at Network Solutions it gets routed to the main account webmail at
LunarPage?s control panel! Not the intended effect at all.

I?ve spent almost a day and a half on the phones with Tech Support from both
Network Solutions and LunarPages, and they have only succeeded in making me
more confused. On the one hand, one tech told me to change the PHP script.
On the other, another tech told me to get the IP address of the mail server
at Network Solutions and put that address as the MX record in LunarPage?s
DNS entries for my domain name. Network Solutions, however, refuses to
provide that IP address for some reason.

My ultimate question, then, is how (if it?s even possible) can I route mail
off LunarPage?s network when its sent from PHP so that it is correctly
delivered to my client?s inbox? Changing the domain name in one or both
instances is not a possibility, and I would very, very much like to avoid
telling the client that they need to transfer their mail account off their
current provider.

I haven?t the DNS or PHP knowledge to figure this one out, and the tech
support people aren?t supportive at all.

Thanks in advance for any and all help.

-Meitar Moscovitz

P.S. I usually get this list in a digest, but this is a time-sensitive
situation. I?d be extremely grateful if a helpful reply could be CCed to
maymaynyc at hotmail.com directly so that I might catch it before the next
digest. Thanks again.

Its possible that Lunar Pages have erroneously configured their mail 
server to accept mail for sphgrp.com and so when the web server forwards 
the email to their server it just delivers it locally instead of looking 
up the MX and sending it on to the Network Solutions mail server for 
that domain. I see the MX record in DNS for sphgrp.com points to 
INBOUND.SPHGRP.COM.NETSOLMAIL.NET. You can probably test this by 
connecting to the Lunar Pages mail server and see if you can send to an 
email address in the sphgrp.com domain (if you can then that's a 
problem). Either way the problem appears to be at the Lunar Pages end.

If you have a control panel at LunarPages - can you simply delete the
MX record at their DNS?

Otherwise, I think the IP your're looking for at Network Solutions is:
216.168.230.179 (traceroute or ping mail.sphgrp.com).

Overall, I'd have to say you need to get that duplicate MX record cleared up.

If all else fails, route it to an email address you have control over
and redirect from there - but that's just plain crazy.

----
This means that whenever PHP sends an email to me at sphgrp.com, it never
leaves LunarPages' network and instead of getting routed to the email
account at Network Solutions it gets routed to the main account
webmail at LunarPage's control panel! Not the intended effect at all.

Typically it's recommended to store files on the filesystem, with
metadata in MySQL.  There are many reasons for this, and depending on
traffic and filesize they may not be that important, but here are some
general thoughts:

In order to retrieve a file from MySQL, this process has to happen:

-- SELECT query is sent to MySQL, which is processed and a result
returned
-- the entire contents of the file is sent to Apache/PHP, and stored in
a PHP variable.
-- PHP then essentially echo's the file contents through it's own output
mechanism, which in turns then goes through Apache

This process involves a lot of network and memory IO, so it's much less
efficient than sending directly from a filesystem.  That said, in some
environments (like shared hosting, where filesystem permissions can be
troublesome) keeping everything in MySQL could make sense.

That will do it, but also keep in mind the potential for date overflow,
since a UNIX timestamp has a smaller range than a DATETIME column.

UNIX_TIMESTAMP('1935-05-29')

for example

Expand on barf...

Error 127 can come from quite a few different problems.  First, double
check

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/MERGE_table_problems.html

that you're not doing something that could cause problems.  

Maybe you're running into a 4gb limit at the OS level?  What version of
MySQL?  What OS?  There are many factors, including tuning parameters,
that could solve this.

30 million records is not that big and I've worked with prospects
supporting many more than that.  One option would be to archive monthly
tables to the compressed MyISAM storage handler, since they're probably
read-only.  Of course, you could consider InnoDB, which often works
better with larger tables.

I think using PHP for this would be fine.  CLI PHP works great and I use
it constantly.  Depending on your MTA, you could even check the quota
"just-in-time", that is when mail is delivered, but before it's written
to the mbox (Postfix comes to mind)

If you have a localhost database and you don't want to sweat file
permissions (webserver-writeable directory), the 25 - 35KB filesize is
nothin'.

Be sure to check the maximum TEXT/BLOB sizes at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Storage_requirements.html (12.5.3)

If I'm not mistaken, a LONGTEXT column can store up to 4GB of data per record.

Hi,

Lunar pages uses CPanel servers. Exim mailserver on pretty much all
CPanel servers is configured to look up /etc/localdomains file to see
if the destination domain is present on the machine, before trying a
remote SMTP. if the domain is in /etc/localdomains file, the message
will be delivered locally. Also, there would be no point asking them
to remove your domain from the localdomains list, because next time
some one runs cpanel maintenance scripts, the domain will be added
right back.

I'm sure this isn't the help you were looking for, but the solution
that has worked for me is to remove the domain from the local machine.

Perhaps someone else can point out a different way.

==========================================================================

"2004-08-03 SECURITY HOLE, fixed in PuTTY 0.55
PuTTY 0.55, released today, fixes a serious security hole which may 
allow a server to execute code of its choice on a PuTTY client 
connecting to it. In SSH2, the attack can be performed before host key 
verification, meaning that even if you trust the server you think you 
are connecting to, a different machine could be impersonating it and 
could launch the attack before you could tell the difference. We 
recommend everybody upgrade to 0.55 as soon as possible. "

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

--------

"Recently, a security vulnerability in PuTTY was found (read 
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ for details) which 
allows attackers to execute malicious code on anyone using PuTTY.
Since the SFTP support in FileZilla is based on PuTTY, FileZilla was 
vulnerable as well if connecting to SFTP servers. Version 2.2.8 of 
FileZilla fixes the security holes."

Oui, monsieur! Clew is available via CVS at http://cvs.nyphp.org/

Hans,

Thanks for the input.  Not getting any response earlier, I decided to dive
in, and it's going well.

what happens if you write a test that:
1. deletes the cookie -- observe results
2. deletes the session variables -- observe results

since "3." is already happening, I'd work on 1 and 2

Hi Phil,

It's not easy deleting session cookies (if that's what you're using,
and don't confuse with PHP sessions). I would suggest changing their
value to something like -1, 0, or false.

Cookie is never deleted, I tried that.

Session variables are never deleted, I tried that too. :(

Change the cookie value?  I can try that, I am using a session cookie 
(as well as PHP sessions)

setcookie("$projectFolderName", "$username", 0, '/');

And upon deletion I do this:

setcookie("$projectFolderName", '', time() - 86400);

No dice though. :(

This is how IE handles cookies - I'm not too sure about other browsers.

The session cookies aren't stored on the clients file system but in
memory only. Non-session cookies are stored on the file system. When
you set your cookie with a '0', the data is in memory, and when you're
doing "time() - 86400", it's on the file system. Try
setcookie($projectFolderName, '', 0, '/');

Can I suggest an optimization? Use explode(). "If you don't require the
power of regular expressions, it is faster to use explode(), which doesn't
incur the overhead of the regular expression engine."
--http://us3.php.net/split

Or:  use a preg_split(), a regex, and make it a two-liner?

list($year,$month,$day,$hour,$minute,$second) = preg_split('/[- :]/',$mysqlDateTime);

Or: consider mysql's own UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date) function in the first place.

This worked:

setcookie("$projectFolderName", '', time() - 86400, '/');

Apparently it simply couldn't find it, I left off '/'

Okay, disregard my last comment - glad you got it solved Phil. 
Personally I don't make use of cookies, so I hadn't much experience with the
problem. If in the future I'm so required, I'll be sure to watch out for
this :)

That was a very simple solution to the cookie problem, however, it 
doesn't help solve the problem with deleting session variables.  I don't 
want to use session_destroy() as I wish to keep the session.

The session itself will be a collection object containing elements from 
several different projects on the same domain.  I want to delete the 
session variables ONLY that pertain to the CMA project, not the XYZ 
project or the ABC project.

This did not work:

foreach ($_SESSION as $key => $val) {
  if (preg_match("/^${projectFolderName}_/i", $key)) unset($_SESSION[$key]);
}

This did no change to the session whatsoever.

Thank you all for the quick replies.

>From the responses to my question, I gather that there isn't a way to
explicitly state from *within a PHP script* that I want mail to go to a
specific mail exchange server. Is that accurate? If so, the rest of this
message could be considered somewhat off-topic as it applies to the DNS and
not really to PHP.

Please accept my apologies in advance for that. Is there a good DNS forum
somewhere which would be more suited to these questions?

As it currently stands, I've set up a "plain crazy" forwarding scheme so
that, at the very least, things are "working."

Does this mean that Exim is not even looking up the MX record to begin with?
If so, then wouldn't deleting the MX record from the Cpanel (if that's even
possible) be superfluous? If Exim isn't looking up the MX records then what
good would it to do alter them on LunarPage's? External emails (i.e, emails
sent from home or other networks) work properly because they never get into
LunarPage's servers. It's only when the email originates at a LunarPages
server does the email get routed incorrectly.

Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125D013B0B31@intamail1.inta>

Now for that, I see a simple solution - make your $_SESSION variable a
multidimensional associative array, with credentials for each section as a
key.

$_SESSION['ABC'] = array("key1" => "value1", "key2" => "value2")
$_SESSION['XYZ'] = array("key1" => "value1", "key2" => "value2")

That way, when they log out of ABC, you only unset or blank out
$_SESSION["ABC"] and the rest of your session data persists. If you need to
pass all that stuff as a URL query sring, use
urlencode(serialize($_SESSION)) to convert the array into something that can
go into a URL.

Thanx.  Apparently redirection has now failed and so cookies nor 
sessions delete of course.  I can't figure out what is going on other 
than that something is being tossed into the HTTP headers to cause 
header() to bomb out (no warnings, no errors, no nothing), thus, no 
redirection, so I just plain gave up and threw down some rather 
way-substandard PHP code to band-aid it:

[PHP]
    /**
     * Logout
     *
     * @access public
     * @return mixed HTML (returns HTML only if header() fails)
     */
    function &logout() {                                    // STATIC 
VOID OR HTML STRING METHOD
        global $projectFolderName, $projectURLPath, $willAuthenticate, 
$projectAcronym, $phpVersionInt;
        if ($willAuthenticate) setcookie("$projectFolderName", '', 
time() - 86400, '/');                            // DELETE COOKIE
        foreach ($_SESSION as $key => $val) {
         if (preg_match("/^{$projectAcronym}_/i", $key)) {
          $_SESSION[$key] = '';
          unset($_SESSION[$key]);                         // DELETE ALL 
PROJECT SESSION VARIABLES
         }
        }
        global $_SESSION;
        @flush();
        if ((int)$phpVersionInt > 420) @ob_flush();    // YOU CAN ONLY 
FLUSH OUTPUT BUFFER IN PHP VERSIONS 4.2+
        clearstatcache();
        header('Location: http://' . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . 
"$projectURLPath/index.php");            // DEFAULT REDIRECT TO MAIN PAGE
        $html .= "\n<script 
type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--\nlocation.href = 'http://" . 
$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . "$projectURLPath/index.php';\n//-->\n" .
                "</script>\n<noscript>\n <meta http-equiv=\"Refresh\" 
contents=\"0;URL=http://" . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] .
                "$projectURLPath/index.php\">\n</noscript>\n";
        return $html;
    }
[/PHP]

This works, however.

Sounds like you need to compile PHP5 with the --with-imap option, turn on the
module in your php.ini, or load it with dl().  In other words, you're missing
the IMAP support module.

Are you sure IMAP support is enabled in your PHP build?

Does anyone have any tips for getting PHP5 and 4 to run on the same 
machine?  I want PHP4 to run as my CLI version of PHP (for PHP-GTK) and 
PHP5 to work with Apache.  Is it as easy as just installing in two 
different places? /usr/local/lib/php4 and /usr/local/lib/php?

Thanks,

Scott,

the easiest way to do this is to use xampp it allows you to switch between
php 4 and 5 whenever you want.

I don't need all the extras that come with xampp though.  I have 
everything else already installed. I just want to add PHP5 without 
breaking too much stuff. And I don't really want to have to "swicth" if 
I can help it. I don't really need 5 on the command line right now, just 
as the Apache module.

Sorry for the question but I need to ask this:  Why would you want both 
on the same machine?  That makes no sense as far as application 
development is concerned.  Just have PHP 5 and write code that's 
backwards-compatible.

I run 4 and 5 together all the time.  Two separate directories.  Both 
are CGI, though, but that shouldn't make a difference.

 From my original post: "I want PHP4 to run as my CLI version of PHP 
(for PHP-GTK) and PHP5 to work with Apache." PHP-GTK won't run with PHP 
5. PHP-GTK is run from the command line.  I want to continue using 
PHP-GTK therefore I need PHP 4 on the command line.

Hello Everyone,

I am trying to get my imap extension to work on my windows php install, i have uncommented the line

extension=php_imap.dll

and restarted apache about 10 times, for some reason phpinfo() is not showing imap, i checked the docs and i see that on linux it requires this

 This extension requires the c-client library to be installed. Grab the latest version from ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/ and compile it. 

i checked and didnt see any windows versions, i checked the windows directory however seems to just have Windows version of PINE.

is there anything i need to install or do to make this work?

This looks like the Oracle extension is trying to 
tear down the connection to the database after 
the handle is already gone. That is, PHP is in the 
process of shutting down and PHP no longer knows what 
the name of the function that caused the problem is 
or the line number.

You may be able to get some ideas about things to try 
by reading about register_shutdown_function() and 
'Chapter 36. Connection handling' in the PHP manual. 

Do you currently have a function registered as a shutdown 
function?

If you really get desperate you might consider tinkering 
around with ignoring user abort -- ignore_user_abort(). 

I don't know if you can write a function that can successfully 
determine why PHP feels it is time to shut down. That is, 
use connection_timeout() or connection_aborted (maybe 
in some combination with connection_status) and 
register it as a shutdown function in order to log 
the situation -- seems like it might be possible.

there's a directive 'extension_dir'
which should describe where your 
'php_imap.dll' resides.

No, only if you want to use builtin the 'mail' command.  The 
functionality you are looking for is implemented in PHPMailer, which 
includes its own socket-based SMTP client.

Specifically look at the second example on this page:

John,

I use an IBM T41 as my primary workstation and it's great (surprise, 
surprise :).... but be ready for some quirks with IBM hardware, you might 
want to play around with one for a while to see if you mind...

- Control key is in an odd postion to the right of the function key
- There is no Windows key (meaning no W+M to minimize all windows or W+E 
to open the Explorer)
- That "cat-tongue nugget" pointer can take some getting used to.

Here are Rasmus Lerdorf's notes on the experience of getting one (in the 
family) and setting it up w/ Debian etc.:

Had one before I left Switzerland, and usaed it on travels ranging from 
Budapest to Hong Kong.  I thought it was terribly ugly at first, but 
quickly grew attached to it as the frequent flier miles piled up.

I immediately fdisked the machine and never saw Windows on it, but hear

I was previously employed by a fortune 500, and we used IBM laptops
exclusivly, no real tricks or anything, several IT guys had linux on
their laptops and all seemed well.

So many additional technologies for me to explore!  And I though PHP and MySQL was enough.  I really do like the XUL features, but they do seem more suited for an Intranet situation than for consumer websites.  
 
Thanks, Jay, for your detailed post.

Ahh, the proxy approach. Excellent solution, and having an Apache with
mod_proxy available means that you can work all kinds of similar magic
with other local and remote webservers.

If your application is compelling enough, people will be happy to
switch to Mozilla or Firefox to use it. Look at all the people who
downloaded Napster or Limewire.

The bits of XUL that Jay touched on in his presentation are just the
tip of the iceberg. Mozilla is a living, breathing, cross-platform GUI
toolkit.

It's not the sort of thing that you would use in place of traditional
web applications -- but it might be where you turn when you run up
against an application in the future that doesn't fit the usual
internet or intranet mold.

Many people have enjoyed building forum software as a means of learning 
programming. Since the specifications are pretty well decided already, 
and there are projects to examine and compare your work to, it is 
educational. Since it is something that people actually use once they 
reach a basic level of utility, it is also kinda fun to develop and 
improve over time.

Take a look at invision power board as an example of a PHP4 solution 
that serves it's user base well. You can use it and play with the source 
to your heart's content.
Take a look at phpBB and all of the security alerts released over the 
past 2 years.

Also adding role-based user authentication to any of these systems (or 
any CMS for that matter) is educational and useful. For example, 
integrating p_auth from NYPHP with a multi-product website (say, for 
example, a Mambo CMS portal with InvisionPowerBoard as a forum) in a way 
that is both modular and able to survive upgrades, would be challenging 
and useful.

Hi Brian,

Well, I've been "off-project" for more than a year doing other things, 
so I can relate--however, I know a little bit about learning, so here's 
some advice that may help.

As you've mentioned above, you want to be involved in a project, 
primarily for the learning it provides, and one of the most effective 
ways is being involved in one that you are motivated to work on because 
you have a need.  The key here is a goal-oriented project rather than 
"this might be nice to learn" project.  For example, a friend of mine 
needed a testing application for his credentialling organization a 
couple years ago.  Of course, I looked for PHP/MySQL apps and discovered 
"phpTest", and spent a fair amount of time customizing and adding a few 
enhancements.  I lucked out (learning-wise) since phpTest is very well 
written IMO, but needs some work to improve security, etc.  A hacker by 
the name of Brandon Tallent wrote it when he was 20 or so.  His stated 
goal was to make a test engine that was "the first choice of anyone who 
needed to test any subject".  He said his second goal was to hack on and 
learn PHP and MySQL.
So much for the motivation aspect.

Now, as to projects, I am sometimes asked similar questions by my 
students and my first response is to work on something that you can be 
somewhat passionate and addicted to.  Sorta the "one more thing before I 
go to bed" project.  No one can tell you what that is.

If you're looking for *ideas* (NOT necessarily well-coded scripts) you 
can look here:
http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/index.html
(remember, this site has a bit of a rep for schlock code, so "choose 
wisely")

another great fishing ground for ideas is here: (same caution as above)
http://freshmeat.net/browse/160/

and of course there's sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/

and you can get some ideas here:
http://www.zend.com/codex.php

hope that helps,
John

Brian,

I have a project up my sleeve that i am going to be working on, it is
basically a forum but rather than only being a forum i am going to tightly
couple it in with newsgroups.

I plan to make it a news forum that when you go read a thread, you are
actually reading messages on a news group.  When you reply well.. your post
get's sent to the news group.

Sorta like Clew is doing with mailing lists i guess, i havent had much time
to look over Clew.

I havent seen anything like this before that is what is providing my
motivation, that and i will learn a lot such as role based security,
Patterns, OOP, reading news messages and connecting to and from a news
server, Template based like smarty but i want to write my own to learn.

If this sounds like a project you would like to help out with and have the
time get back to me.

Right now i havent had much time aside from work to do anything so i havent
started the project yet, although i will be shortly.

Joe Crawford Jr.

Sometimes is the good to learn more about a language is just to look at it.
High-quality code, like the modules in Pear, are a good place to start. 
  Seeing
how the code looks and how it is documented will help define a good style
guide.  Here is another frequently referenced coding style
<http://alltasks.net/code/php_coding_standard.html>.


Over at Horde <http://www.horde.org>, they have a concept that I really
love...project bounties <http://www.horde.org/bounties>.  People and/or
companies sponsor new enhancements for a small cash reward.  This is great in
at least two ways: 1) the project evloves and 2) it gets more developers
learning the codebase.  I would really like to see this become part of
Soureforge and/or Freshmeat.

It seems like coding a CMS is a rite-of-passage, so perhaps you should
consider that -- or as John suggested, a forum / bulletin-board.

But rather than tackle a mega-project like that, a single,
well-written PHP class (a la Pear but without the dependencies
perhaps) makes a great project, especially if you write it in
canonical PHP5 so it can serve as a roadmap to developers who haven't
seen as much of the new syntax.

Some things that might be fun/handy off the top of my head:

- an implementation of the Atom api for web publishing
- an implementation of scp (secure copy) (really, just an interface to
the command line program)
- a php class that provides an interface to Apache's Lucene indexer
- an RSS feed agregator

It's too bad they don't include alt.binaires.*

I read that PHP5 has a new type of user authentication, but the tech at my web host says it will be at least 6 months to a year until they switch to have the "kinks" are ironed out first.

Well, obviously it's written in Googlish! ;-)

All kidding aside, the source code for the user interface is available
-- and it's the user interface (xhtml+css+javascript) of the new
Google apps that really rocks.

Yes, but this question is more vague than you might think. Can you
describe the method of authentication that you want to perform?

Well, something had better rock because the content sure doesn't!  It 
seems Google is grabbing anything it can stick ads onto these days.

But I guess newsgroups might be a pretty attractive challenge for the 
PhD's... it looks like they are doing a straight text-match in this 
beta. Stemming is off, no synonyms, tons and tons of keyword spam in the 
results set.

What exactly is so interesting about the user interface?

See if you can think of something that would be useful for 
you to use, some internet tool. My not very imaginative 
answer when I asked myself the same question was an email 
client. I had accounts scattered across the various webhosts 
I'd rented space from, or inherited control of a site on. 
So I wrote a PHP email client that could easily hop from 
account to account. So there's network programming, oop when 
you deal with the objects the imap functions return, 
databases, maybe, to store mail or at least logon data. Then 
later others started using it, so there's sessions, cookies, 
what have you.  People complain about the gmail interface, 
but if I have a problem with my webmail interface, I just 
change it to suit my needs. Anyway, it's a not too big (but 
can get very big, if you want) little project.

You know what I think would give you the most inspiration?  Pick 
something you are very interested in, and build an application to help 
you organize your information.  So if you like food, build a recipe 
website, if you are into football, then build a sports portal.  More 
important than the purpose of the tool, make sure you:

* use a distributed version control system (cvs, subversion)
* use existing classes for common tasks (ADOdb, PEAR, jpgraph, etc.)
* include multilingual support (a.k.a. "i18n")
* separate code into separate scripts not just for function, but to 
support multiple developers
* include XML-RPC to support external, non-PHP clients

These will go a long way getting you into the right frame of mind to 
write really exceptional code, and also accommodate other interested 
parties on the Internet - as well as have some room for expansion.  You 
will be simply amazed at how great it feels when you start something 
that takes on a life of its own, and you will learn a great deal more 
from that experience than you ever could by just writing an academic 
exercise.

Depending on your ISP you can use a .htaccess to set httpd.conf variables.
You'll need shell access to run htpasswd.

Ahhh, OK. HTTP Basic Authentication can be done with PHP:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php

This is probably the easiest way to implement this, but if you want to
apply HTTP Basic Authentication to an entire directory, you can use a
.htaccess file. Just create a file by this name, and you can put Apache
configuration directives inside (just as if you were editing httpd.conf).

Hope that helps.

You could also bypass apache altogether and use PEAR::Auth, or 
PEAR::Auth_HTTP:

    http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.authentication.php

I use PEAR::AUTH as often as possible, as it is pretty powerful (and 
easy to use).

I've got a T40 and wouldn't trade it for anything - well, except a T42
:)  They can be a little quirky (like the hard drives) but overall it's
great.

This is mainly for Joe and Susan since both of them seemed to have 
worked with PHP and HTTP Authentication, maybe they'll be able to 
discern this problem.

I wrote an HTTP authentication function authenticate().  However, you 
are being forced to log in twice every time you use this function, and I 
honestly can't figure this out.

This might make things easier to understand:

This is index.php:

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


       Authentication Block - this block will determine whether or not 
user has logged in or has successfully logged in by checking:

       1) IP address against stored value in project_globals.inc.php
       2) Cookie for $projectFolderName
       3) If they have remained in the utility or have gone elsewhere - 
then cookie should be overwritten
         New 5/20/2004: User-defined variable $willUseSSL generated into 
project_global_plugin.inc.php will be a Boolean to
       determine if the there will need to be an SSL layer for the 
unauthenticated IVC.  If the user has not yet logged in and
       chose to set $willUseSSL to true in the installation, the script 
will redirect to an SSL layer and ask for authentication.  A
       check is also done to ensure that if the user is logged in yet 
remains in an SSL layer, they will be redirected out to ensure
       full IVC functionality.

       New 5/20/2004: The cookie with key of $projectFolderName will be 
checked first to bypass the unnecessary instantiation of
       LoginSessionGenerator for performance enhancement.  If the user 
logged in, the cookie exists and no need to check further.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/ 

 if (($willAuthenticate || $willBasicAuthenticate) && 
$_COOKIE["$projectFolderName"]) $isLoggedIn = true;    // NECESSARY FOR 
SSL-TO-NONSSL REDIRECTION

 if (($willAuthenticate || $willBasicAuthenticate) && 
!$_COOKIE["$projectFolderName"]) {
  $errorArray = array();
  $lsg =& new LoginSessionGenerator();
  $lsg->handleLogin();
  $errorArray += $lsg->getErrorArray();
  $isLoggedIn = $lsg->isLoggedIn;
 }

 if ($_COOKIE["$projectFolderName"] || (($willAuthenticate || 
$willBasicAuthenticate) && $isLoggedIn) || !($willAuthenticate || 
$willBasicAuthenticate)) {
  $authBool =  true;
 } else {
  $authBool = false;
 }

 if ($willAuthenticate || $willBasicAuthenticate) $lsg = null;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


This is the class LoginSessionGenerator method handleLogin() in 
classes.inc.php:

   /**
    * Check for login status either through WWW Basic Authentication (if 
$willBasicAuthenticate is true) or via IP verification
    *
    * @access public
    */
   function handleLogin() {                                // VOID METHOD
       global $willBasicAuthenticate;
        if (!$this->isLoggedIn && $willBasicAuthenticate) 
$this->isLoggedIn = authenticate();
       if (!$this->isLoggedIn) {
        $this->validate();                                            
               // SEE IF THEY HAVE ALREADY LOGGED IN
        if (!$this->isLoggedIn && !$this->cannotLogin) 
$this->check();                // CHECK TO SEE IF LOGIN PROCESS USER 
ENTERED IS VALID
        if (!$this->isLoggedIn && !$this->cannotLogin) 
$this->displayLoginHTML();    // DISPLAY LOGIN HTML INNER TEMPLATE VIEW
       }
   }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


This is authenticate() in functions.inc.php:

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

   This function will utilize the ability to use HTTP-based WWW
   Authentication, checking for the global authorized password against
   the password entered in the client project's CSV file.  Will not 
function
   unless this password exists.
   See http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php for more
   info
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/ 

if (!function_exists('authenticate')) {            // FUTURISTIC: IN 
CASE AN "authenticate" PHP FUNCTION IS MADE PART OF CORE IN THE FUTURE
function authenticate() {       
   global $username, $password, $projectFullName;
   if ($password && preg_match('/IIS/i', $_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']) && 
$_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']) {
    list($user, $pw) = explode(':', 
base64_decode(substr($_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'], 6)));
    if ($user === $username && $pw === $password) return true;    // 
AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL WITHIN IIS WITH ISAPI
   }
   if ($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] && $password &&
        $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] === $username && 
$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'] === $password
        ) return true;
   if ($password) {
    header("WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"$projectFullName\"");
       header('HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized');
      echo "You must enter a valid login ID and password to access the 
$projectFullName\n";
       exit;
   }
}
}

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Email Signup Script
Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.0.20040830153210.04468650@mail.earthlink.net>

Hello NYPHP,
Does anyone know where I might find a simple "email signup" script? 
Basically, someone comes to the site, signs up their email address, and 
then gets an email with a confirmation link. When they click on that link, 
the fact that the email address was confirmed is recorded in the database. 
That's all I really need. I know there are full-fledged systems that do 
much more than that, but all I really need is this piece (if possible). I 
checked Sourceforge and also Googled, but didn't find much. Simple to read 
through and understand would be great too. Any ideas?
Thanks!
Harvey

this would be simple to create read up on the mail() function and also read
up on the $_GET variables

very very easy to make this script.

It's at the bottom, and here:

function authenticate() {
   global $username, $password, $projectFullName;

But for the benefit of the newbies it would be helpful to provide an
outline in pseudo-code and leave the rest as a proverbial exercise for the
reader. I've done similar stuff but never actually done this exact task.
Here's how I might go about it; feedback is welcome.

(1) create a MySQL table with fields id, email, is_confirmed etc. Make
email a unique index. Make a varchar(32) column called conf_code for
holding an md5 hash of the email.  make is_confirmed an unsigned tinyint
default 0.

(2) the signup script:

if it's the first pass, draw the form.

if the form is POSTed, validate.

If it's invalid, display error message, redraw.

otherwise: insert into your_table set email='$their_email',
conf_code=md5('$their_email');

send email to $their_email saying thank you, please go to
http://yoursite.com/confirm.php?conf_code= . md5($their_email) to confirm
your address;

redirect to success page that says, thanks, please go check your inbox.

(3) the confirmation script:

if there are no GET parameters, display a form prompting them for the
confirmation code. if there is a GET parameter conf_code,
select count(*) from your_table where conf_code ='$their_conf_code'

if count is 1, update your_table set is_confirmed = 1 where conf_code
= '$their_conf_code' and say thank you.

otherwise, say sorry...

Is there an order of which you should follow when giving Oracle
functions?  Well, clearly you'd want to login and create a
query before supplying a command, but, beyond that.

I've got some PHP 5.x scripts running... and, it's odd, the
return I receive. I get both an Oracle database error, but yet
I get the query results.

It's quite confusing....

Here is the entire echo listing...

... I don't even know where to start really. I want to get past
the Oracle errors, because I need to debug the rest of the PHP
code, but it seems like they will never go away.

Thanks.

You would probably want to add some randomness to the confirmation code 
instead of using a straight md5 hash of the email because anyone could 
create a email request then confirm it (by md5'ing the email address and 
pasting to the end of the confirm url). Better to generate a random 
number, add it to the end of the email, maybe add unix time to it, then 
md5 the whole mishmash. Save that result as a key in the database. The 
confirm script would then look up and validate the user based on that 
key value.

For those of us using O'Reilly Safari, can you mention the chapter or 
topic? The page numbering is not part of Safari.

I am guessing you are referencing 17.2 "Sending Mail" but I can't be 
sure....

8.26 "Program: Website Account (De)activator"

Safari may think this is 8.27. I believe it numbers the chapter intro
as recipe 1 instead of recipe 0.

May I suggest that when sending your email you might want to look at
using the phpmailer class.

I have found that the best way to keep the mail out of MSN/Yahoo/and
the likes junk mail boxes is to deliver the mail from an actual
account on your system.

 I create an account for outgoing mail called system at mydomain.com and
use the SMTP functions in the phpmailer class to send the outgoing
mail from that user.

 (phpmailer also supports multi type email for attachments or HTML email)

http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/

Check it out:
//Create a new Mailer Object
$mailer = new PHPMailer();
$mailer->IsSMTP(); 
// SMTP server
$mailer->Host = "mail.mydomain.org"; 
// Outgoing mail server username
$mailer->Username = "username";
// Outgoing mail server pasword
$mailer->Password = "password";
// Mail From address
$mailer->From = "tommyo at mydomain.org";
$mailer->FromName = 'Thomas ONeill';
$mailer->Subject = $subject;
$mailer->Body = $body;
$mailer->WordWrap = 50;
$mailer->AddAddress($toemail);
if($mailer->Send()){
     //success
}
