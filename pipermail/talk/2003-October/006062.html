<PRE>Marc,

I am sorry I can't help you.

After I read your post, though, something didn't seem right.
I thought I could remember something about tar preserves the
ownership of files --
Unless you tell it not to (with --owner=user  option)
So I searched the web for my own benefit (&quot;tar file
ownership&quot;)

I found the following:
...
Package: tar
Version: 1.11.8
Revision: 1

The session below demonstrates a NASTY bug in tar.  Tar does
not
restore ownership of files.  I tried -p, --preserve,
--same-owner,
etc., and nothing worked.  I verified that my passwd file
was alright.
The clincher was when I ftp'ed the latest slackware tar from
a
friend's machine and tried it.  Slackware's tar worked just
fine...

1/msg00411.html

Now I am not suggesting that this is the answer to you
situation.
I am pretty sure its something a lot simpler.

But as you can see in the correspondence above it was very
specific about the
Version of the software.

That reminded me of the fact that it is always a good idea
to mention the release version
Of the software you are discussing.

Hope you find your answer(soon).

Regards,

Tim G.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] TAR and permissions


Hi there:

I've written a simple script that's moving files from a
staging 
server location to the live server area (virtual servers on
the same 
Linux box).

I'm doing it by creating a TAR file from specified files in
the 
staging area, copying the TAR file over to the live area,
and 
extracting it.

My problem is that all files coming out of the archive are
having the 
user and group 'apache' assigned to them.  Is it possible to

accomplish this without altering the user/group information?

(The script is being run from a Web interface...PHP scripts
are being 
parsed by the PHP Apache module, not the CGI version.)

Cheers,

--
