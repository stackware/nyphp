Not to rekindle a thread that has died gracefully, or painfully depending on your viewpoint, but I think it raises some important points.

For those that missed our prior dev meeting, we're going to be working on a mailing list system that will enable people to unsubscribe from particular threads and resubscribe to them at a later point.  It will also have an interactive archive, ie forum, so people will be able to have essentially the same flexibility and functionality of forums and mailing lists, and new features realized by the combination of the two, including an interface of their choice.

Until technology solves all of our problems, however, simply deleting messages is something some of us may take for granted.  We've received feedback from NYPHP-Talk subscribers, both past and present, that the list can have heavy traffic.  While email filtering can alleviate much of this, some email clients, providers or users don't provide/utilize it, and there's still reason for concise, complete and well-formed postings.

Perhaps it was more a shove than a nudge, or perhaps the messages began to get a bit back-and-forth.  Whatever the case, people should not hesitate to ask questions on the list, nor at the same time be afraid to rebut.  And, for those with suggestions on making the lists more useful or to help draft some guidelines, swing over to NYPHP-Dev at <A HREF="http://nyphp.org/lists">http://nyphp.org/lists</A>

NYPHP-Dev, where deleting is a way of life :)
