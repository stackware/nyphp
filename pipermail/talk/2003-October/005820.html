<PRE>Phil,
You are correct you don't have to prove anything to anyone.
However if you are requesting help, then you should plan on making the
request in a way that people are likely to provide help and not grief.  If
the request even hints that you haven't done &quot;sufficient&quot; research first,
then you're likely to get grief.  If you spend a couple minutes in the first
email explaining what you have done and what you have tried, then it's
likely that you'll get your question answered.  Think about the time you've
spent on this thread.  If you had provided a &quot;better&quot; request, then you
would have saved that time.

Words in quotes are to be considered very subjective.

Chris

I am not having to prove to you whether or not I read the manuals.  I know
I did and that's all that matters.  I read them and they didn't make it
clear to me, and I explained that already.  I've moved on, thanks for your
help.

Phil

By your lack of response, I'll take this discussion to mean &quot;would,&quot; thus
you didn't actually read the PHP manual on line.

By the way, the manual has code examples that you can cut and paste, then
examine and play with to determine how things work.

Enjoy,
