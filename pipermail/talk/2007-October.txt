There is nothing "abstract" about what I just said.  There is NOTHING pretentious about saving time.  Time is money; that is CONCRETE business terms.  Rapid, high-quality work is what makes workers more valuable than their peers.  I don't know what can be more concrete than saving time, and I also don't understand what's harmful about being abstract.  When programming, it's about getting things done correct, explicit, and fast.  That might mean you need to be abstract or you need to be concrete.

Very few programmers should build a solution from the ground up, and we all use off-the-shelf components somewhere to save time.  For example, there's nothing pretentious about using a database to store data.  A database is an off-the-shelf program that stores data.  If that off-the-shelf solution can pay for itself in three years, then guaranteeing yourself a positive return on investment is a sound, concrete decision.

An object-oriented framework saves time, or it sucks and no one would use it.  That is the major benefit: saving time.  Come to that, most people don't view the language as the time saver but instead view the framework as the time saver.  Most people don't "pick OOP", they pick a framework that addresses a problem application domain.  There is nothing "abstract" about this benefit.  I put myself in the direct pathway of the consequences my decisions have.

I find the notion that polymorphism is arbitrarily beneficial to certain projects to be very "abstract" and also forcing a technology instead of a solution.  It makes it sound like there is a "Ghost in the Machine", when there is none.

There were many discussions about this in the past months and they all 
resulted to this being a futile attempt. In order to display the content in a 
browser the users have to download the file. This is how the WWW works. 
Printing is as easy by pressing Print Screen. There are some attempts to stop 
caching, obfuscating the real source URL of the file, and some tricks 
disabling the most obvious functions for printing and saving, which may or may 
not work depending on browser used.

As I pointed out back then, you try to solve a management problem with 
technology and that never works. Your ebooks need to be priced right and be of 
such a high quality that the users do want to pay you for them. If that 
doesn't fit your business model, seek out avenues other than online 
distribution. The only good idea that I have is self-desctructing CDs, which 
yet have to be invented.

Good luck, you will need it for what you want to do.

Java containers didn't work well with the type system in older versions of Java,? but JDK 1.5 introduces generics, foreach and other syntactic sugar that makes them more fun to work with.

??? Java developers rarely used hashes (associative arrays) when I was doing Java 5 years ago,? but they're much more fashionable now -- they've been learning from the PHP (Perl, Python,...) world.

Hi Michael,

I have taken onboard all the comments and research things further and was
eventual able to force an error message
Warning: mysql_query() [function.mysql-query]: Access denied for user
'ODBC'@'localhost' (using password: NO) in C:\xampp\htdocs\tp_test.php on
line 38
Armed with this info I changed the PHP.INI and used
grant all privileges on *.* to ODBC at localhost identified by enter with grant 
option;
both with and without the password and still I cannot move ahead.

The error message is a "mysql error 1045". There appears to be one PHP rule 
for Linux and another for Windows.
Apart from the obvious of moving from Windows to Linux  does anybody have 
any ideas or suggestion that will help me overcome
this problem. From what I have read on the MySQL website there does not 
appear to be any help there
as what I am trying to accomplish works in MySQL command mode. It only falls 
over, for me anyway, when trying the same thing using PHP & MySQL.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Hosting Choices -- application infrastructure support
 or 100% security?
Message-ID: <C326994A.86C8%cliff@pinestream.com>

So I have two ?managed? dedicated hosting choices:

The first one claims to manage the entire application infrastructure with
?fanatical? support. Guess who. Very expensive, but it does appear as though
they take on the entire sysadmin role (which I define as anything other than
code), which looks like a bargain compared to hiring a dedicated sysadmin.

The second claims to offer 100% security, but I will need to manage the
application stack, meaning AMP, postfix, mysql/InnoDb backup strategy, etc.
Never mind the fact that a security breach will result from something stupid
like SQL injection, these guys do offer some pretty darn cool security
features like intrusion protection, vulnerability scanning, F-Secure
anti-virus, DDoS protection, Tripwire, and server hardening.

After following NYPhP for the past year or two, I?m not a bad PhP hack, if I
do say so. But managing Apache, MySQL, postfix, backups, etc. seems like a
big effort and a big learning curve. Heck, I can barely use vi. And there?s
only so many hours in the day.

So what would you do if you were in my shoes? Go with the wiz-bang security
and muddle thorough the application infrastructure learning cure. Or go with
the fanatical support and be done with it, know that the security might not
be as cutting edge?

I have experience of this company on an enterprise level, and they  
are tip-top. In fact, in my 6-7 years in dealing with datacenters,  
I've not found one that is helpful as this.

Can you have them install other daemon's on the system?

For example, what if you want to run a sphinx search server, or a AIMbot 
server, etc.

If not, what is the likelyhood of you wanting to?

*eh* I'd go with the managed server these days so I can focus on the 
code.  You can always move later if you decide you need more 
security/functionality.

Not to be contrary :-) but there is *always* a way.

In this case there are social engineering approaches to the application 
of technology which work, but they don't involve PHP any more than 
building an HTML form or writing a PDF file might involve PHP. No, I 
won't explain them, and anyway people who look for scripts and 
"software" to protect their eBook websites don't usually commit adequate 
resources to execute effectively.

People log into web pages they would never want to print or distribute 
every single day of the year. It's not about prevention, but persuasion. 
Think about that, and you'll see some possibilities.

OK, then craft a web page that has something in it that disables using Print 
Screen. Show me that and I'll be a believer. Until then I stand to what I 
wrote earlier. OK, and not posting it on a page is cheating. ;)

David you have to think outside the box. It's not about technology... 
it's about causing the user to not *want* to print that screen, or save 
and share/email/etc. That's all I'll say ;-)

I would like to have a directory under ~/public_html that completely
disables all mime time interpretations. Specifically, if I put a php
or cgi file in there I want people to see the PHP.

I tried the following just to see if I could disable .php but it had no effect.

    <Directory /home/me/public_html/code>
       RemoveType .php
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
       Options Indexes
    </Directory>

Any ideas?

Mike

Hi,
I am not sure if this helps, but, from the httpd manual:

RemoveType directives are processed after any AddType directives, so
it is possible they may undo the effects of the latter if both occur
within the same directory configuration.

You may want to check your global server configuration, give it a try.

Make sure you have Override FileInfo in a highly layer directive as well.

As it turns out, this is actually really hard to do.

It does not seem possible to redefine a subdirectory of public_html.
Many directives in .htaccess are just ignored or generate errors when
you know they're supposed to work. I managed to create a separate
directory not under public_html without a .htaccess that worked
(mostly - index.php was still preventing directory indexing).

If would be nice if there was an Apache directive that meant "clear
everything and treat all content as static text/plain,
unconditionally, everwhere".

OK... now I have to know... make it include personal information  
about the user (social security/credit card info/nude pictures)?  I  
guess photoshop could get rid of that though.  Hmm....

On a more serious note, a friend recently told me what some labels  
are doing with their album pre-releases to the press.  Each album is  
stamped with some inaudible frequency over the whole thing.  Then if  
the album got leaked, the label could take the leaked version, check  
out which frequency is on it, and then look up who leaked it and call  
in the lawyers.  Of course... how long until people figure out how to  
get rid of those frequencies?

Let's just make everything free.  :)

	Had a client who twice lost existing content while making a change
using a CMS. Turns out the problem was they he was using a DSL line
and he made a change and hit the "Submit Changes" button before the
page had fully downloaded. Needless to say the undownloaded textarea
fields were empty and were written to the DB.

	Is there a way to disallow a form submit before the entire form
has downloaded?

Simplest solution is to keep submit button disabled by default, and then 
enabling it by javascript when page is loaded.

Technically it can be done like this.

# While writing submit tag, keep it disabled by default.
# In the form where this button exists, put javascript code at the end of page 
to make it enabled.

By this way until page will get reloaded, Submit button would not be available 
in press/click mode.

Agreed.  Also, in case the user hits enter to submit, you should force 
the form's onsubmit to do nothing while form is loading.

You can also check that the form was fully loaded on the server side (in 
case javascript was off or otherwise futzed with), by checking for the 
existence of the last field in the form.  As long as it's not a checkbox 
/ radio button, even if it's blank it'll still send the data.

if (array_key_exists('last_field', $_POST) === false) {
    // show form with warning or change sql to exclude field
}

Urb:

I don't understand the download problem, but the rest can be done via 
javascript. Please review this:

http://webbytedd.com/c/form-submit/

If you use js to check client-side before submitting server-side, 
then by definition it would require the entire form (required fields) 
to be downloaded and filled out before sending.

Cheers,

tedd

I was confused on the relevance of this topic but since PHP and MySQL go
together like PB&J I thought it would be relevant.  

 

It has gotten to the point that the application that I built for candidate
tracking is growing astronomically so now I was given the task of backing up
our data.  So far our Apache/Drupal installation is backed up and SCP'ed to
a secure server.  My one big problem is backing up our MySQL database.  Does
the script "mysqlhotcopy" have the same drawback as just copy the files
manually (frm, MYD, MYI) in the sense that the server can't be updating
anything.  To be honest I can't guarantee that no one in the office will not
be using the system at certain times so it might present a problem.  Would
it be easier to just to script something that follows this logic:

 

Pre: rename index.php, copy in temp file with downtime message

 

1.)    Stop daemon.

2.)    Copy all the table files *.frm, *.MYD, *.MYI files, tar/gzip them

3.)    SCP archive offsite

4.)    Delete temp folder

5.)    Restart daemon.

 

Post: delete temp file, rename file back to index.php

 

Is it unrealistic for my office to expect 100% uptime, even at 3:30 am in
the morning (those whacky recruiters).

Cliff,

 

I believe we use MyISAM and after verifying it with phpMyAdmin all the types
for our tables are MyISAM.

First off, what engines do you use? Mysqlhotcopy does not work for the
Innodb engine.

I?m no expert, but it that?s the case, I believe you can just use
mysqlhotcopy, without stopping the database. Even if it does a lock, it
should be very fast, since its a file copy, not a dump.

I'm no expert, but it that's the case, I believe you can just use
mysqlhotcopy, without stopping the database. Even if it does a lock, it
should be very fast, since its a file copy, not a dump.

Cliff,
 
I believe we use MyISAM and after verifying it with phpMyAdmin all the types
for our tables are MyISAM.

It has gotten to the point that the application that I built for candidate
tracking is growing astronomically so now I was given the task of backing up
our data.  So far our Apache/Drupal installation is backed up and SCP'ed to
a secure server.  My one big problem is backing up our MySQL database.  Does
the script "mysqlhotcopy" have the same drawback as just copy the files
manually (frm, MYD, MYI) in the sense that the server can't be updating
anything.  To be honest I can't guarantee that no one in the office will not
be using the system at certain times so it might present a problem.  Would
it be easier to just to script something that follows this logic:
 
Pre: rename index.php, copy in temp file with downtime message
 
1.)   Stop daemon.

2.)   Copy all the table files *.frm, *.MYD, *.MYI files, tar/gzip them

3.)   SCP archive offsite

4.)   Delete temp folder

5.)   Restart daemon.

 
Post: delete temp file, rename file back to index.php
 
Is it unrealistic for my office to expect 100% uptime, even at 3:30 am in
the morning (those whacky recruiters).

First off, what engines do you use? Mysqlhotcopy does not work for the
Innodb engine.

Franciuos,

 

I started at www.php.net, more specifically this link:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php.  I cannot recommend any books
since I have not purchased any but can point you to some links to tutorials
online:

 

http://www.tizag.com/phpT/.

 

Also reading the topics and discussions on this mailing list are a good way
to learn as well.

If you want to do a database backup with no downtime, replicate to a 
second mysql machine. You can stop the slave and perform a dump. Then 
after the dump is complete, it will sync back up upon restart. If you're 
really tight on hardware resources, you might even be able to start a 
second instance of mysql (listening on a different port/socket) and do 
it all on the same machine.

You could also just check that the form fields are not empty when processing
the form.. or put the submit button *after* all of the fields.

Javascript is too breakable to rely on for process intensive things... also,
what happens if someone uses the site with javascript turned off? The form
will be completely unusable.

I think for sake of ease of doing this project we will just have a ten
minute drop on the server at midnight every night to backup the database.
Granted that is a great scheme to get it done and I will investigate how to
do so just for knowledge sake.  Thanks for the insight.

I doubt it will take 10 minutes.  From http://dev.mysql.com/doc/ 
refman/5.0/en/backup.html:

"You can also create a binary backup simply by copying all table  
files (*.frm, *.MYD, and *.MYI  files), as long as the server isn't  
updating anything. The mysqlhotcopy script uses this method. (But  
note that these methods do not work if your database contains InnoDB  
tables. InnoDB does not store table contents in database directories,  
and mysqlhotcopy  works only for MyISAM tables.)"

I assume a ten minute window as I have not done it before.  I am going to
have Cron call that script but just to make sure at the start of the script
I am going to make sure people don't have access to the CMS so the database
doesn't try to update itself.  I found that link useful, actually found it
before I posted on the user group.

Hello,

I just came into this conversation mid way, but I wanted to include a script 
I use
via cron to do mysql backups. Not sure if someone already provided this.

[sk at tinman ~]$ crontab -l
0 */23 * * * /path/to/sql_backup.sh

[sk at tinman ~]$ cat sql_backup.sh
DATE=`date '+%m%d%Y'`
DUMPFILE="/path/to/all_databases-$DATE.sql.gz"
/usr/bin/mysqldump --all-databases --user=root --password=changeme | gzip > 
$\
DUMPFILE

I have a site where the ID keeps getting appended to the URL. So I
went in and added the following lines to my config.php file, which is
included on every page.

ini_set('session.user_only_cookies', TRUE);
ini_set('session.use_trans_sid', FALSE);

The ID still shows when I first visit the page. If I refresh, it goes away.

This is more than a little annoying. What else do I need I need to do?

Guess you could redefine .php as text/plain or something.

Yes, or just force this behavior, because when a type is removed, it
defaults to the default type.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Multi-server DB config caching strategy
Message-ID: <C32AB79C.88FA%cliff@pinestream.com>

I?m understand caching and packages like cachelite, etc. What perplexes me
is how to update a cache in a multi-server, one database environment. Say I
cache config data from the database on each server. If I update config info
in the database, how would I propagate this out to each server. Essentially,
how would I invalidate each cache?

Normally, a cache routine checks for an expire time against a file. But what
is the equivalent with a database? Create a last updated field? Perhaps
there?s a last updated flag in the db?

Ideas?

Why not just have a memcached instance run on every webserver and be
done with it?

Dead simple, maybe I could present memcache at NYPHP?

Dang, that is dead simple. I knew there had to be an easy answer. Seems like
it would even work well as a caching solution for one machine, providing for
painless scale-out.

Thanks,
Cliff

So Mitch proposed memcached as a solution to caching a DB in a distributed
environment. For that matter, why not use memcached or even an in-memory
database engine for sessions?

Remind me why I need to store my sessions in a disk-based file or database?
Sessions are meant to be temporary, not permanent.....

?apc.shm_size  integer
The size of each shared memory segment in MB. By default, some systems
(including most BSD variants) have very low limits on the size of a shared
memory segment.?

How do we determine the size of our system?s shared memory segment?

The memcache extension automatically a memcache save handler for  
php's built-in sessions - set the ini session.save_handler
  param to "memcache".  I haven't tried it yet though.  Anyone used it?

If you want to support a "remember me" session, you'll need to backup  
your active sessions from time to time in case of a server failure or  
reboot.  You'll also need to make sure you have enough memory to  
store all of the currently active sessions.

Try:

cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

... or something similar. It worked on Ubuntu Linux, anyway, so it
might work for you.

I think what you want to do is actually set "use_trans_id" to TRUE.

>From the docs:
session.use_trans_sid whether transparent sid support is enabled or
not. Defaults to 0 (disabled).

You want the sid to be transparent, so I would set that to true and
see if that helps.

Exactly, that is one occasion where you'd want to store the session
data in case of reboot/disaster/Microsoft.

Didn't know that memcache could be used as the default session save
handler though, that's interesting.

For Joomla I implemented a memcache driver for JSession, so it's
handled at the application level.

It must be my birthday today. As I have managed to solve my two knottiest problems today.
Here is the solution to my email problem

<?php session_start; ob_start;
    ini_set("SMTP", "smtp.isp.com");
    ini_set("smtp_port", "25");
    ini_set("sendmail_from", admin at isp.com);

   $to  = "johndoe at hotmail.com";
   $subject  = "Enter your subject here";

   $message = "YES IT WORKED @ LONG LAST
                        I can put anything I like here";

   
   $from  = "FROM: admin at isp.com "; 
   mail("$to", "$subject", "$message", "$from");

   echo "The email has been sent";
?>

I hope this helps others who are wrestling with the same problem

  Thanks for the solution. I've tried it and it did not work for me
  changed php.ini to reflect change rebooted my system. Don't really understand why it is necessary to download QK SMTP 
  Has all my problems been something to do with XAMPP under windows??

    ok that will not really work 
    you should use SMTP=localhost then download QK SMTP Server to make this work.

      Did you restart your web server (Apache?) after making the changes to 
      the PHP.INI file? This has to be done for the changes to take affect.

Just in case others have been suffering from the same problem I have cut and 
pasted my test table (authorised_users) into this posting, in order that 
others who want to follow it through can.I have also left the MySQL 
mysql_error() debugging tool in just in anybody wants to try it for 
themselves. The problem lay in the database and table call and the only way 
I found that out was through the mysql_error() routine. All the strange 
message all stemmed from the wrong type of database and table calls.

Message-ID: <FNECIMPGNCFHIALFIGIPKEGLJNAB.jeffmailings99@verizon.net>

Is readcfg a PERL command? If yes, can it be called from PHP?
I'm sifting through someone else's code and I'm trying to make sense out of
it.

I am trying to get the server address of my development server, but
$_SERVER[?remote_addr?] and $_SERVER[?server_addr?] keep giving me the
localhost addr (127.0.0.1). Kinda makes it hard to create a URL for
redirects.

The IP address should be 192.168.168.###, based on the current DHCP setting.

How do I get the IP address of the machine?

You probably did this already: http://www.google.com/search?q=readcfg
Doesn't show much in the way of PERL-specific stuff, but it does turn up 
a Windows binary called readcfg.exe; could be relevant, but maybe not.

Wanna show us the lines you're wrestling with?

Hi Cliff,

$_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] gives me the correct IP on a development  
server. Your mileage may vary for a local machine running apache  
locally...

Allen,

Thanks for your reply. Probably because I saw the word "PERL" in a few
places...I jumped to conclusions.

Did some additional digging and found a homegrown function with fifteen
parameters (all well-named, I might add...see below...I'm sure this was
intuitive to somebody...but not me). The function parses a text file and
does a search/replace on variables that are in the text.

function
readcfg($cfile,$rt1="",$rw1="",$rt2="",$rw2="",$rt3="",$rw3="",$rt4="",$rw4=
"",$rt5="",$rw5="",$rt6="",$rw6="",$rt7="",$rw7="")

Jeff

Thanks. We got it ? turned out to be a different screw-up. Server_addr was
the server and remote_addr was the client machine.

Here is my version of sending items via email, I was creating a site where
you can bounce things to a Verizon or Cingular phone from my server such as
wallpapers.  Has some imaging resizing code in there as well but the code
mostly illustrates how to send multimedia files using the right header
information.

is not already smaller than 240 x 320

later.";

240 pixels

                if($width > 240)

It must be my birthday today. As I have managed to solve my two knottiest
problems today.

Here is the solution to my email problem

 

<?php session_start; ob_start;

    ini_set("SMTP", "smtp.isp.com");
    ini_set("smtp_port", "25");
    ini_set("sendmail_from", admin at isp.com);

   $subject  = "Enter your subject here";


   $message = "YES IT WORKED @ LONG LAST
                        I can put anything I like here";


   

   $from  = "FROM: admin at isp.com "; 
   mail("$to", "$subject", "$message", "$from");


   echo "The email has been sent";
?>

 

I hope this helps others who are wrestling with the same problem

Thanks for the solution. I've tried it and it did not work for me

Did you restart your web server (Apache?) after making the changes to 
the PHP.INI file? This has to be done for the changes to take affect.

I believe you can begin your quest for that type of knowledge here:

Good morning, 

Super off topic, but since this list is one of my best resources for help, 
I figured I'll try here.

I've spent a lot of time on google and can't seem to figure out the problem.

I have a PHP app that is converting .avi's to .flvs. I'm using ffmpeg and lame.

I've built ffmpeg w/libmp3lame support enabled, to encode to .mp3 for the .flv

However, I don't know much about this stuff, and I can't seem to figure out the correct
parameters. The online documentation for ffmpeg is lacking.

It's not so much lacking, as there are so many different parameters that 
are format specific, and many that you would only use for a particular 
combination, that it is a waste of time to try to document it all when 
they can be working on making the next version.

Generally, I find it easiest when working with ffmpeg to find someone 
else that wants to do what I want and start with a known working formula.

For example, converting to flash is a web thing.
People running personal DVR's do a lot of Flash conversion.
So if you search for Mythweb and FLV you will get a lot of hits on 
people who want to convert their MythTV recorded videos to FLV.

Here is a simple howto, give it a try:
http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Stream_mythtv_recordings_from_mythweb_using_flash_video

Also, please note that FLVTOOL is very important in making flash videos. 
  Basically, without getting technical(cause I have no clue what it is),
the flv file you get from ffmpeg is gonna be one loooong file where you 
have to start at the beginning and go to the end to view a file.  No 
fast forwarding, no rewinding.

FLVTOOL adds some "bookmarks" to allow you to jump forward and back in 
the flash player.

FFMPEG is not always as forgiving of poorly packaged audio/video as a 
video player(VLC, Windows Media, Realplayer, etc).  Which leads to loads 
of headaches when someone has a file that plays fine, but after 
conversion is missing the last 5-15 seconds of audio or video or both! 
In such a situation, one thing to do is to upload the video to Google 
video or Youtube.  They use similar programs and run into the same 
problems - so if you can demonstrate that Youtube can't convert the 
video, you will find people a lot more understanding of why their 
free/low cost app won't do it.

There are a couple of services to convert videos to flash(or convert 
from any format to any format) where you submit your video and they 
email you a link or some such.  There was one I used that was credit 
based, so they had a relatively intelligent API for doing the conversion 
- this moves the conversion off of your responsibility and onto someone 
else, but it costs something like 10 cents per video.  For medium 
traffic sites or proof of concepts, I'd start with them and only deal 
with ffmpeg when it becomes economically justifiable(ie you are willing 
to put the hours in to troubleshooting again and again when problems 
crop up).

For extremely low volume, use Super to do the translation offline on a 
PC and just upload Flash videos.

Hello,

Good points.

I've gotten ffmpeg to work on the .avi's, but I've yet to try it on .mpeg's.

I'll take a look into the credit based conversion.
I haven't noticed problems w/the sample video, but I've only done a few.
I won't start seeing problems until other people are using it. = ]

I don't seem to be having that problem w/the converted videos.
We have a flash player we've developed ourselves.

Wish I knew what a problem it was before I fell into the trap of deliverying
a working application.

I knew what a problem it was and so set the rate quite high - so they 
had someone else do it and when they ran into problems than had to deal 
with hourly charges for troubleshooting.

The sad thing was they were uploading maybe a dozen videos over the 
course of a week - ie it would take next to nothing to convert the 
videos manually and ensure they work perfectly.  But they got stuck in 
the mindset that they paid hundreds of dollars for automatic conversion, 
so they wanted automatic conversion if it costs thousands more in 
troubleshooting problems.  :-(

The audio rate needs to be resampled to 44100Hz in order to work with
the mp3 encoder. Use the command line switch -ar 44100

ffmpeg development frequently exceeds the ability of documentation to
keep up--remember that it is an interface to a ton of different
libraries and codecs, many of which are in constant flux themselves.

The developers tend to reorganize command line switches between
versions, too. C'est la vie, it's such a useful tool that you complain
a bit and move on.

This seems to have been fixed in recent versions of ffmpeg. Hmm, it
seems I'm using the latest snapshot, so it might not be in any
releases.

The only problem I still experience with flv encoding under ffmpeg is
an audio pop at the end of some videos. Otherwise it works great, and
is impressively (even scarily) fast.

Hello Chris,

I got the sampling to work with -ar 22050, which I'm guessing I could change 
to 44100 without any trouble.

Yah, ffmpeg is a great tool. Really powerful and yes, REALLY fast.

I'm having trouble w/mpegs, but I've gotten the thumbnail's working as well.

CentOS (rhel) is a better choice.

Why not use CentOS, as it has the php versions you need.

PHP is not hard to build from source (though on Solaris its a bitch 
because the Solaris build system is old and retarded). It really 
depends on what extensions you want enabled. The libraries those 
extensions depend on need to be installed first before you configure and 
build PHP. So basically you will have to do the dependency checking first.

I used to do this on older-no-longer-supported RH boxes.

What was your (bad?) experiences? I've used it without issues...

Cliff, you should be able to use a fedora core source RPM on a RHEL  
system. I've done this on a RHEL3 system before, but not for PHP.

It might be easier to get it done from source. If you don't fancy  
doing it, I'm sure there are people on this list and others who could  
assist.

IMO there is no such problem compile php in a fedora box. You may just
choose the right directives carefully :)

Good idea. I?ll have to try the Fedora rpm idea. If not, I might as well try
installing myself. Good exercise for the future....

CentOS is probably fine for PHP.

Not so good for Ruby/Rails - I had to rebuild Ruby from source to be able 
to use Capistrano2 (in case you're wondering about the relevancy, Im using 
Capistrano to deploy PHP apps ;-)

Hi Cliff,

Once you install something from source, you bypass the automated
update capability of your distro. That package and all of it's
dependencies suddenly become much less predictable. For these reasons
I almost never build anything from source. And when I do, I use
rpmbuild to build from .src.rpm (on RPM based systems anyway).

I recommend that you get a distro specifically suited to your needs. I
agree with the other poster that CentOS is a good choice. Specifically
you want CentOS 5 Server w/o X (although the .0 release looks like it
has some SELinux issues - you might want to install w/ SELinux
disabled and then enabled it later when you have everything dialed
in).

I do not recommend Fedora or Ubuntu or any other desktop oriented
systems (even if it's a "server" version). RH's core business is Linux
*servers* so stick with CentOS (for those who may not be aware, CentOS
is basically RHEL with all the logos and stuff stripped out). That
also makes it easy to upgrade to RHEL if you're business takes off an
you want better support.

No worries. Just do:

  # yum list | grep php
  # yum install php-ldap
  # yum install php-imap
  # ...

Yum will figure out all the deps and get and install the right
packages. It's not the fastest thing in the world but it does the job
and works out of the box.

Message-ID: <043522D9-17C5-43C8-BD7B-8EBE61E64FAE@jonbaer.com>

Im taking Zend Neon for a spin + am not sure if all the templates  
being created for a framework project are actually working correctly.

It looks like the index.php file is out of place and creating new  
Zend controllers + Zend views dont seem to place them properly unless  
you explicitly specify the path (as oppose to the project folder  
itself).

All in all it's not bad but it seems some of the templates are  
incomplete(?), has anyone tried it out yet + have feedback and / or  
having same issues?

Hello All, 

I'm sure this has been done a bunch of times and answered even more.

I looked around google and I just want to the most basic implementation
I can find. Something in PEAR would be nice, but I'd like the "user friendly"
wrapping of calls to already be done.

I want to allow users to upload images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, gif, etc) to use
as an avatar for an online application.

What's the best 3rd party lib for doing this. It will need to resize to approriate
sizes (maybe even convert to a common format) and I need it to be secure,
no "file.gif.php" or #> cat "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > img.php hacks.

Thanks for the ideas!!!!!

Hello Jon, 

A gravatar, or globally recognized avatar, is quite simply an 80?80 pixel avatar image that follows you from weblog to weblog appearing beside your name when you comment on gravatar enabled sites. Avatars help identify your posts on web forums, so why not on weblogs?

Not exactly what Im looking for. In fact, this has external dependencies on the gravatar.com site.

Thanks anyways.

http://pear.php.net/package/Image_Transform

or

http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick or use the GD Library - it's  
really not that hard...

Check for the file's mimetype via:

http://pecl.php.net/package/Fileinfo (some docs on this: http:// 
www.jellyandcustard.com/2006/01/19/php-mime-types-and-fileinfo/ )

Or via the command line:

/usr/bin/file -i filename.ext (your location of the file program may  
vary)

Ben:

What's the difference between an avatar and any other 80 x 80 pixels graphic?

If there is no difference, then why not do it yourself? It's a fairly 
simple thing to upload a graphic and scale it to 80 x 80 pixels.

Cheers,

tedd

Well I was not suggesting to fully use the gravatar site itself  
(although you can scale to whatever size you wish for your avatar  
using &size=n), I think they recognize anything > 80px to not be an  
"avatar" ... your question dealt w/ the security of such images + the  
technique w/ the MD5 hash of email address link to an image path was  
more the idea.

There actually is an excellent library if you want to roll your  
own ... http://phpthumb.sourceforge.net.  It includes this hashing  
mechanism already.

Message-ID: <c7c53eda0710121000yc91623ate757acc952c056ad@mail.gmail.com>

I can't find where I read it originally, but somewhere I've been told
or read that "using $_REQUEST is bad form." I understand that in cases
where you want to force a $_POST request, but if you might receive
$_GET or $_POST then isn't is better than doing if/elses?

The only related thing I could find on Google was this guy (
http://mypetprogrammer.com/blog/?p=15 ) but he seems to erroneously
believe that using $_POST somehow saves you from a SQL injection
attack.

I'm also thinking that some servers don't use the $_REQUEST array.

Can you define why it's bad form? When is it considered acceptable to use?

Thanks!

What is the difference between let us say: unset($result); and
mysql_free_result($result);?

 

I noticed that unset's documentation doesn't include any information about
memory being returned.

I recall that this was discussed several weeks ago on this mailing list, so 
you may want to look through the archives.
I never came across the situation where I didn't know if the incoming data 
comes fro a GET or a POST. In any case, I do want to know as I'd trust a GET 
even less than a POST to deliver some sane and safe data (not that I wouldn't 
check / prepare it anyway).
IIRC the matter is not using or not using REQUEST, but what one does with the 
stuff that is returned.

You're saying it doesn't? But it still saves one from parse errors and 404s....

That is possible. Server provided arrays are something that really baffles me, 
especially the wild variations between the various $_SERVER implementations.


> Can you define why it's bad form? When is it considered acceptable to use?

As mentioned above, I don't think it is "bad", but more dangerous in the sense 
that you may not get anything when the server does not craft this array. It is 
more that you need to know what to do with the data. I do wonder if there ever 
is a situation where it is unknown if date comes from POST or GET. Since you 
know what the variables are called and are supposed to contain, isn't it 
reasonable to assume that  one also knows how the data gets submitted?

It's bad form because you should know whether data is being passed to
you from a form or via the url. You can post a form to a url that
contains parameters, in which case some data will be in the $_GET
array and some in the $_POST array. What happens if you have a
parameter in the url with the same name as a form field? One of them
will be missing in the $_REQUEST array.
If you don't know which way a piece of data will be coming in, then
you probably have a poorly designed site.
The other thing to remember is that a url (meaning what's in the
$_GET), gets recorded in the web server log. An unencrypted, plain
text file. Nothing private she get recorded there.

The rule to follow is that $_GET should be used to retrieve data from
the server, $_POST should be used to pass data to the server.

If you setup an function to be called by multiple scripts(For example, 
pulling a list of matching auction lots based on search criteria) and 
you want to allow anyone to view your data or embed it on their site.

You might PREFER to demand a POST, but since your goal is to advertise 
the data demanding it would be a stupid thing to do - let the other 
people pull the data for display any way they want.

If your dealing with a large, complex application and your only changing 
one small part of it and have to complete it in a few hours.  You may 
have a GET coming from one section of the site, but you can't guarantee 
some other page isn't doing a POST.

All that said, though, it is remember that REQUEST is not just GET/POST, 
it's also COOKIE.  So if your logic counts on certain variables being 
empty if their not passed to the script, Than your better off using 
conditional logic to retrieve JUST the GET and the POST.

Mainly, the issue comes into play when you don't get to design/dictate 
the entire site OR you count on external web developers to call your app 
for some reason.

The difference, I think, lies in the fact that unset($result) unsets
the "value" for a variable, whereas mysql_free_result actually free's
the result identifier associated with $result (try echoing $result out
before freeing it to see what I mean).

Basically, mysql_free_result() is database aware, and unset() is not.

unset will free the memory from php's memory, mysql_free_result will
free the memory from the database's memory. mysql_free_result really
has little effect on php memory usage.

As others have mentioned, it is harder to debug and/or more open to
confusion because it combines inputs, and that can sometimes lead to
surprising results.

It's not that you shouldn't use it, but you should be aware of the
potential consequences (POSTed values overwriting GET, COOKIE values
overwriting GET and POST) when you do.

The semantics of the get and post HTTP methods is different. Get
requests are always supposed to be "safe," not making changes to
server-side resources. There is no expectation that post requests
_must_ be unsafe, but it's kind of implied.

Based on that, I think it is good form to pick either get or post for
your interface, depending on whether a resource is being updated or
not.

Hello Again,

No, I don't want to roll my own at all. I want the quickest way possible
to do this.

The code I have *should* work, but doesn't....

            $imageObject =& Image_Transform::factory('');
            $imageObject->load($fileName);
            if ( PEAR::isError($imageObject) )
            {
                error_log("imageObject->load( ) error");
            }
            $imageObject->fit(90, 110);
            if ( PEAR::isError($imageObject) )
            {
                error_log("imageObject->fit( ) error");
            }
            $newFileName  = substr($fileName, 0, strrpos($fileName,"."));
            $newFileName .= '.png';
            $imageObject->save(USER_IMAGES_PATH . $newFileName);
            if ( PEAR::isError($imageObject) )
            {
                error_log("imageObject->save( ) error");
            }
            print_r($imageObject);

I can't figure it out. No PEAR errors are getting thrown,
but the image is never being saved.

Any ideas? The file is getting uploaded to the server, I can see that.

Thanks!

Well I was not suggesting to fully use the gravatar site itself
(although you can scale to whatever size you wish for your avatar
using &size=n), I think they recognize anything > 80px to not be an
"avatar" ... your question dealt w/ the security of such images + the
technique w/ the MD5 hash of email address link to an image path was
more the idea.

There actually is an excellent library if you want to roll your
own ... http://phpthumb.sourceforge.net.  It includes this hashing
mechanism already.

Others have already pointed out that for reliability sake, $_POST and 
$_GET give you direct access to user supplied data before some other 
process has interfered with it.

Originally GET and POST were intended for different purposes.  The one 
to "get" data from the server and the other to "post" data to the 
server.   In real life this means that a GET querystring is limited, 
depending on the browser, to about 2000-8000 bytes.  A POST query on the 
other hand is expected to upload files, possibly post large text fields 
and so forth and so the size of a POST is allowed to be much more than a 
GET.

But if you take large uploads out of the picture, the simple fact is 
that a GET and POST are functionally identical once the PHP script is 
executing.  Each arrives as an associative array.  If you treat them 
differently then you are doing so out of respect for conventions that 
have no direct impact on your program.   In cases like this I go back 
and forth. I will do whatever produces the most reliable code, even if 
it defies convention, but if there is nothing to be gained by defying 
convention I will try to go along so as to avoid all the free advice you 
get from the code police.

One difference not pointed out is that GET is usually transmitted in plain 
sight via URL, whereas POST is not. That hasn't anything to do with what 
happens on the server side. I generally dislike GET just for that reason, but 
sometimes it comes in handy.

The most direct answer to my original question was from Brent: "It's
bad form because you should know whether data is being passed to
you from a form or via the url."

While this is partially correct, I believe that you could run into
situations that you want to accept both (e.g., a record ID via a
hidden field or via a GET). I'm aware of the differences between POST
and GET, I just wasn't sure why using the $_REQUEST array was
considered bad form.

Another good point that was made:
"Mainly, the issue comes into play when you don't get to
design/dictate the entire site OR you count on external web developers
to call your app for some reason."

As far as I can tell there's nothing fundamentally wrong with using
$_REQUEST, but if you can control how the data is passed, more power
to you.

One last question, David, you said in reference to $_POST saving one
from SQL injections:
"You're saying it doesn't? But it still saves one from parse errors
and 404s...."

Using $_POST over $_REQUEST makes no difference in what you receive -
you'll still have to escape data that you put into a SQL query either
way. How does using $_POST save one from parse errors and 404s?

Thanks for all of the feedback.

A few things to try:
- It might seem obvious, but first I'd confirm that the error_log is
acting as expected.
- After you first initialize the factory() object, check to see if
that creates an error.
- When calling "save" you're only passing the filename. I don't know
if you're perhaps using an older version of this, but according to the
documentation a 'type' parameter is also required. See docs here:
http://pear.php.net/package/Image_Transform/docs/latest/Image_Transform/Image_Transform.html#methodsave

Just a couple of other things that I noticed:
- The blank string in the factory() call isn't necessary (it defaults
to that anyway).
- If it does turn out to the be second parameter in save() causing
your problem, you might want to check your php.ini file to make sure
the E_WARNINGs are being displayed or handled somehow.

    The most effective PHP code doesn't use $_GET,  $_POST,  $_REQUEST 
or any of those superglobals except inside a few subroutines.

    $_GET,  $_POST and $_REQUEST are not reliable across PHP hosting 
environments because some have "magic_quotes_gpc"on and other have it 
off.  There's also the problem that some PHP environments have strict 
variable checking on and others don't.  If you want "value not set" to 
evaluate false without errors and warnings,  you need to write something 
like:

if(isset($_GET["myvar"])) {
    $myvar=$_GET["myvar"];
} else {
    $myvar="";
}

This gets tedious if you need to write it hundreds of times in your 
app,  so write something like

function get($name,$default_value="") {
    if(!isset($_GET[$name])) {
       return $default_value
    };

    if (get_magic_quotes_gpc()) {
       return stripslashes($_GET[$name]);
    } else {
       return $_GET[$name];
    }
}

Now you can forget about magic_quotes_gpc and other runtime 
configuration and go ahead writing reliable apps.  In real life you 
might pick a name that's a little less prone to namespace conflict.

Hello Brian,

Thanks, I fixed it though (by using another library.) heh.

- Ben

            $imageObject = new ImageTransform( );
            $imageObject->sourceFile = USER_IMAGES_PATH . $fileName;

            $newFileName  = substr($fileName, 0, strrpos($fileName,"."));
            $newFileName .= '.png';

            $imageObject->targetFile = USER_IMAGES_PATH . $newFileName;

            $imageObject->resizeToHeight = 90;
            $imageObject->resizeToWidth  = 110;

            if ( !$imageObject->resize( ) )

The comments perhaps are more informative than the article was, as he
barely explained anything in any meaningful detail. Other than "I
tried to do a PHP site in Rails the PHP way, and it sucked." there's
*very* little information in this article.

Perhaps the most amusing was the vi-vs-emacs style debate that raged
for about a week. Personally I see each with their own strengths, and
prefer to make software with the right tool for the job (the old
hammer/drill saying applies here).

However, I can agree with one sentiment that the author has - working
in Rails has made me a better PHP developer, with better application
design and semantics. And PHP has the flexibility for me to go beyond
that world, whether that is good or bad is up for debate though
*laugh*

But that's not exclusive to Rails... I think being versed in multiple
languages causes this inherently.  I came to PHP from a long history
with Java and Struts, so I tend to approach things in an OO-manner
with a heavy focus on Unit Testing and MVC.

Stealing... er.. sharing good ideas and lessons learned only helps.

Hello,

Hopefully, this is not off-topic. I have a couple of html image tags
such as <img src="/path/to/file.php" /> on a single web page, and each
such tag points to an image creating php file that sends out image
headers and image data after receiving certain data parameters through
POST. I am unable to figure out how to send POST data to a URL path that
is embedded inside an img tag (...and not even sure if that is indeed
the right way to do it). 

I need to use POST since there is a limitation on the length of the GET
vars. I tried using curl (never used it before and just learnt about it)
to replace the entire img tag...something like this:

$imgurl = curl_init();
curl_setopt($imgurl, CURLOPT_URL, '/path/to/file.php');
curl_setopt($imgurl, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($imgurl, CURLOPT_POST,'datastuff='.$datastuff);
curl_exec($imgurl);
curl_close($imgurl);

Nothing much happens if I do that. I know I can avoid this approach by
simply using session variables but I am curious if there is an
alternative approach to this. Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Best Regards,
Nefertitian.

No post data is being sent, It should be ...

curl_setopt($imgurl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, 'datastuff='.$datastuff);

Definitely an interesting article, but a little short-sighted.

For the vast majority of PHP applications, the biggest speed
improvements are made by reducing the size of the pages generated (to
minimize the time in transit) and optimizing the database (efficient
layout, proper indexes and optimized queries).

Every little bit helps, but the impact of most of those tweaks is
marginal compared to the gains to be found in those 2 areas for most
systems.

Looks to be a summary of a bunch of other php optimization articles.  
I've seen most of these tips in one form or another in the past.  Though 
a lot of these will give you minimally incremental speed increases, 
optimization tends to be application specific.  Nothing beats profiling 
an entire application and speeding up the slowest areas.

Besides caching, following all of these points, you might shave a few ms 
off of every request, but if you rewrite a slow database layer or slow 
template engine or properly index your database and optimize your 
queries (as Dan mentioned), you may very well notice speed increases in 
multiples of 10 and 100.

Message-ID: <003301c80ff2$01fba370$05f2ea50$@com>

$_REQUEST provides an opportunity of some degree for a hack and/or an
attack against a script or application.  

Worst case secenario is the you as new programmer on a complex legacy
application that incorporates $_REQUEST has actually taken over a script
product that has willful backdoor hacks integrated into the programming,
such as that deep in some large class object or buried in a benign PHP
include file there could plausably be functionality that is expecting
and operating on variables that can at anytime be forced into the script
logic stream by simply adding them to the URL GET or POST data.

The above noted is clearly a very bad worst case, but has a higher
probability of occurring that you might first consider becasue
statistically more black hat attacks and breakins occur from inside
people inside the company rather that external attackers.

Now if you employ sanitizing techniques on all your variables that not
only cleans up the expected varibales but additionally proactively
destroys or denies all other unexpected variables than you might be
Okay. 

For example, in my last sanitizing scheme, I maintained a white list
array of expected variable names and all REQUEST data was first compared
against the white list before it was operated on. All other variable
names not on the white list were not only ignored but explicitly
destroyed. Additionally, in a script when I was expecting POST data, I
explicitly destroyed the GET data. 

The additional rub of dealing with GET, POST and COOKIE data with the
same variable names is also a potential downside that might not affect
you but might trip up a future programmer who works on your code later. 

I think the case against using $_REQUEST is fairly solid and if an
existing script is allowing other users and applications from anywhere
in the world to essentially submit any kind of variables by any method
they please, then we might have a 'situation' of some sort on our hands
that likely needs careful review and re-review.

Warmest regards, 
?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] $_REQUEST: Bad Form?

I can't find where I read it originally, but somewhere I've been told
or read that "using $_REQUEST is bad form." I understand that in cases
where you want to force a $_POST request, but if you might receive
$_GET or $_POST then isn't is better than doing if/elses?

The only related thing I could find on Google was this guy (
http://mypetprogrammer.com/blog/?p=15 ) but he seems to erroneously
believe that using $_POST somehow saves you from a SQL injection
attack.

I'm also thinking that some servers don't use the $_REQUEST array.

Can you define why it's bad form? When is it considered acceptable to
use?

Thanks!

I would say incomplete, or perhaps cart-before-horse.

As many have pointed out, the big two are database optimization and size 
of return payload.  Everything else is single-digit percentages after that.

Once you've got the db stuff down though, it seems it can't hurt to 
develop habits to use code known to be slightly faster, like the 
single-quote vs. double-quote thing.

Absolutely there are tips in there which are valuable, but by the same
token there are many which are of marginal value.

For example, the 'tip' regarding checking the length of a string (33).
While the method advocated may save a couple of cycles, it adds another
level of obscurity to the code which will make it that much less
readable and maintainable in the future, especially if you are not the
one doing the maintaining.

The tips I would consider worthwhile are:

5.  Unset your variables to free memory, especially large arrays.

This is a good practice and can help out greatly if you are operating on
large data sets.

15. Turn on apache's mod_deflate
42. mod_gzip which is available as an Apache module compresses your data
on the fly and can reduce the data to transfer up to 80%

These are really the same tip, compressing output can increase speed if
your pages are large or your clients are on slow connections.

16. Close your database connections when you're done with them

If you are using non-persistent connections this is a good idea and will
help you to avoid having old connections hanging around on the db
server.  If you're running on a dedicated machine persistent connections
are even better (don't use persistent connections on a machine hosting
multiple different applications).

17. $row['id'] is 7 times faster than $row[id]

This is elementary, and if you are developing with error_reporting E_ALL
(as you should) you would know that php will try to resolve id as a
constant if it is not quoted.

28. Surrounding your string by ' instead of " will make things interpret
a little faster since php looks for variables inside "..." but not
inside '...'. Of course you can only do this when you don't need to have
variables in the string.

I subscribe to the single quotes school of thought, mostly because I
find it much easier to locate variables when reading the code.  Also, if
the string you are building is destined for html, sql or a url the
variables should be escaped anyway.  Using single-quotes and escaping
inline makes it trivial to spot where this isn't being done.

$name = $_GET['name'];
// 10 lines of code
echo 'Your Name: '. htmlentities($name);

vs

$name = htmlentities($_GET['name']);
// 10 lines of code
echo "Your Name: $name";

If you get into the habit of using the first format (I define a function
h() as a shortcut for htmlentities()) you will be able to spot instantly
any place you forget to properly escape $name.  With the second format I
guarantee you won't.

31. Your PHP scripts are recompiled every time unless the scripts are
cached. Install a PHP caching product to typically increase performance
by 25-100% by removing compile times.
32. Cache as much as possible. Use memcached - memcached is a
high-performance memory object caching system intended to speed up
dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. OP code caches
are useful so that your script does not have to be compiled on every request

Good advice, and can definitely provide huge speed increases.

41. Profile your code. A profiler shows you, which parts of your code
consumes how many time. The Xdebug debugger already contains a profiler.
Profiling shows you the bottlenecks in overview

This is the kicker, and will tell you where YOU can make gains with YOUR
 code.  If you want more speed, start by profiling your code and you
will be able to tell exactly where to focus your efforts for maximum
results.

But that's not exclusive to Rails... I think being versed in multiple
languages causes this inherently.  I came to PHP from a long history
with Java and Struts, so I tend to approach things in an OO-manner
with a heavy focus on Unit Testing and MVC.

Stealing... er.. sharing good ideas and lessons learned only helps.

For the php, html, css, image, & javascript files in a web application, who
should be the owner and group? (assume a dedicated server).

Should the owner be a user, Apache, a username that is specific to the
application? Should the group be apache?

What is the best permission level? 644, 640?

Thanks,

I'd say it really depends (you must have seen that one coming haha).  
If your web application needs to write to files then those files need  
to be writable to someone, and it's better imho to be writable by a  
specific user than "the world". In that case having the files owned  
by the user that php will run as is usually safe. Alternatively you  
can use group writable permissions. If you don't have to write to the  
file system the owner of the files is not so important so long as the  
files that you want the world to read are world readable.

> _______________________________________________

well if apache is running as nobody, php is running as nobody (most  
likely) and that's a case where I'd say you might want to reconfigure  
things so that apache/php run as a different user. Most of the time  
when I've seen nobody, there are lots of daemons running as nobody  
and it might not be a good idea to have so much running as nobody (in  
case someone manages to hijack something else that's running as  
nobody). Creating a user like www might work, but as you know it all  
depends. Also, keep in mind that if you chown stuff to a user that is  
not a login user and you have shell users that need to edit those  
files you will run into a problem (but that's where group perms  
really do come in handy).

My shared host chowns files that they want me to be able to edit to  
my shell user, with the group being a special group they have created  
for process segregation. For files they don't want me to edit (some  
special log files mostly), they chown those files to the segregated  
"apache user". On the servers at my office anyone who needs to edit  
files is also trusted with sudo rights (very few of us) so we can  
edit any file on the system regardless of who owns the file. If you  
are the only user you might not need to worry about that as much but  
(last time I promise...) it depends ;)

Again it's really only a problem if your PHP has to write to files on  
the system and not strictly to some mysql db, for example. As long as  
the php interpreter and apache (and of course, the world, that is -  
web browsers) can see the files you should be alright.

Hope it helps!

Setting up apache in a chrooted environment puts you in the driver's
seat regarding security options, and makes it possible for much more
granular control over the security aspects of your webserver.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [ANNOUNCE] Various Andromeda Announcements
Message-ID: <471510EA.7010008@secdat.com>

Hello everybody,

I have a handful of announcements about Andromeda, the database 
application framework for PHP.

First, I have created an alpha version of a very exciting new user 
interface design and concept.  Heavily ajax-based, it aims to beat the 
desktop for usability.   The main thrust is heavy use of the keyboard, 
and having events happen in realtime.  So if a user is on the "First 
Name" box and hits "F", it pulls the first 15 rows where the name starts 
with "F", no need to click "Search" or anything like that.  We put in 
things that desktop users expect, like arrow keys!  Hit SHIFT-UPARROW 
and it sorts on the column you are on, stuff like that.


The new UI is in alpha, I believe there is enough there to see what it 
is about.  We are looking for volunteers to help get it going in IE 
(Right now only firefox) and to round out the design ideas and finish it 
up.

The live demo is at: http://dhost2.secdat.com/develop.  If you just 
login, then go to the "new x4 version" link and hit the number 0, it 
should be self-explanatory from there.

Next, I've modified the main Andromeda page to get the long-overdue news 
articles features.  So bookmark the Andromeda page 
http://www.andromeda-project.org and check back at least once/week, 
there will be a lot of announcements coming out.

Third, I've added HELP WANTED postings over at the sourceforge site: 
http://sourceforge.net/people/?group_id=188856.  If you want to help but 
don't know what to do, that will get you started.

Fourth, we have our first unofficial code contributor down here on Long 
Island who has been working with Andromeda and giving me tweaks.  More 
on that once he gets back from vacation and "goes public" as it were.

More later!

Many thanks. This was really helpful. My strategy is already formulating. A

I agree with kc,  I think its pretty interesting how all these people that
are into rails act like MVC and ORM where invented there.  I too have worked
with Struts, Hibernate and other J2EE tools but I realize that MVC was not
invented there either.  MVC and other design patterns are just that, Design
Patterns, they can be implemented in a number of development environments.

On my laptop this works out just fine.  But on the production server you

Yeah, looks like you're using a character set that isn't one used 
commonly on web browsers. You maybe have it installed on your computer so 
it works there.

In Firefox on my machine, I see the following header sent with the HTTP 
request:

Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7

So Im guessing that you need to use this encoding.

When that page is sent, the web server is telling my browser that it's in 
ISO-8859-1.  It isn't.  It's UTF-8.  For Firefox, choose View, Character 
Encoding, UTF-8, and suddenly the page will be rendered correctly, because 
you told your browser to ignore what the webserver told it and render the 
page in UTF-8.

If I look at the headers that the webserver sent with the page, I see:
-------------------------------
Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2007 20:07:32 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.2-pl1-gentoo
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: private
Pragma: no-cache
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

200 OK
--------------------------------
See that second to last line?  That's wrong (as in, it doesn't match the 
page you're serving).

So either you need to write your app in ISO-8859-1, or you need to tell your 
webserver to serve the proper header.  You can do it in Apache or in PHP.  
Here's a page of useful info:

http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset

Probably the server on your laptop is configured slightly differently than 
the production server.

What *I* would do to solve this problem is get rid of the fancy curly quotes 
altogether.  They are nothing but trouble.  While curly quotes in books 
(dialogue) are nice for readability, where you're using them they're 
definitely wrong.  That is, if you write:

<A HREF= curly quote http://yahoo.com curly quote >

this is not correct HTML.  HTML calls for the double-tick mark, not whatever 
the curly quote character is, so if you cut-and-paste that into an HTML 
document, it won't parse.  You can turn off the curly quotes in 
OpenOffice's options, so that it won't auto-convert the double-tick mark 
for you anymore.

Keep in mind, the primary purpose of Kannel is to allow a linux box to 
send SMS messages either through a cell phone, or through another SMS 
provider.

As such, your not going to find a lot directly on Kannel and PHP, it's 
not relevant.

The codeword to search for is:
SMPP, MM1 and MM7 .  I will note that a brief google search doesn't show 
much good info.  Mainly, I believe, because the protocols themselves are 
so simple and trivial, that once you implement it most people don't even 
see it being worth their time to document.  There does seem to be a PEAR 
library for SMPP, http://pear.php.net/package/Net_SMPP_Client
That one seems to be targetted for communicating with your own PHP built 
SMPP server using the SMPP Server pear module.  However, assuming the 
protocol calls follow the standards, you should be able to use it with 
Kannels as well.

There is also one for "SMS" http://pear.php.net/package/Net_SMS
Browsing that package, it looks like a generic set of interfaces to 
either clickatell, vodafone, a generic smtp to SMS gateway, and a 
generic http gateway.



I'd attack the solution in stages.

Stage 1:
Download and setup your PHP script to use the ClickATell PHP libary. 
Spend a few bucks on buying credits from them, and get your PHP 
programming working first.


Stage 2a:
Get your kannel server configured and working correctly.  IIRC it comes 
with a simply web interface for sending SMS messages.  Since this is a 
simple post/get to a URL, you can adapt your PHP program to post the 
message data through the web interface.

OR
Stage 2b:
Give the Pear SMPP module a try with ClickATell, since they do support 
the SMPP protocol.  If you can get it working with a generic set of 
function calls, than in stage 3 try Kannel with SMPP.

Stage 3:
Look into MM7, MM1, or SMPP and work out the protocols and then adapt 
your ClickATell script for Kannel(make new functions to replace the 
ClickATell ones that implement the SMS protocol you choose)

One thing I'd recommend is hunting around for C SDK's for SMS messages 
and compiling their samples to give you a command line interface for 
testing against the various protocols.  IE if you can get a stock SMPP 
based command line program sending messages, than you know you aren't 
dealing with problems in your protocols.

Another alternative is to give NowSMS a try, as their forums are a bit 
more well trafficed for integration solutions, and then switch to Kannel 
once you have NowSMS funcitoning(NowSMS is a *shudder* windows program 
that provides the same functionality as Kannel+Mbuni ie SMS and MMS 
messages.  IIRC the lowest license for it was 500-1000, with a 60 day 
demo.  Worth giving it a try to jumpstart development, and then 
determining once you have everything working if it is more cost 
effective to buy the license or fiddle with Kannel, and then Mbuni if 
your looking for MMS messages)

As a last alternative, my memory also prods me that Kannel comes with a 
a sample program for processing email messages and converting them to 
SMS messages.  So for purely sending messages, you can give that a try.


Hmmmm, so...after all of that, I guess my first question should have 
been: What is it you want to do with PHP regarding cell phone messaging? 
  Send text messages?  Send text and multimedia messages(ClickATell 
can't send multimedia without hoops)?  Receive text messages(ClickATell 
falls flat there).  Receive text and multimedia messages?  And do you 
want to do this with an attached cell phone, or through a text message 
service?(Kannel supports both).

(I've looked into and played with SMS on a number of occassions, but the 
either the projects never materialized so I didn't take it to the 
implementation level, or I found a commercial interface such as 
ClickATell, which worked out to be more cost effective).


Lastly, now that I've given you all the various bits and pieces, here is 
my advice: For pure text messages, assuming you were considering Kannel, 
forget EVERYTHING I said above.  Your wasting time on a single solution.

If you can run a Kannel server, than you can run an AIM message bot.  So 
you can send text messages by AIM.  And AIM will send text messages to 
most cell phone carriers - for free and without sticking advertising on 
them.

So if you implement a PHP to AIM gateway instead, you will have 2 way 
functionality, the ability to send messages to instant message clients 
AND cell phones, and if your smart and use a multi-system connector like 
your own jabber server, you can send messages to most other major 
instant message applications.

Every time I implement paging for search results I end up using  
different approaches, but I'm never happy with any of them. Am I  
missing a simpler, more "correct" solution here? Here's what I've tried:


1) TWO-QUERY APPROACH

on every page view:

- step 1: execute search query with a "SELECT count(*) " to get the  
total record count

- step 2: run the search again with the appropriate LIMIT clause to  
retrieve the records I need for the current page



2) ONE QUERY, SEEK TO RESULTS

on every page view:

- step 1: execute search query

- step 2: use *_data_seek() to move to the right slice of results for  
the current page



3) ONE QUERY, CACHE EVERYTHING

on the first page view:

- execute search query, fetch all results, and cache them

on every other page view:

- retrieve the right slice of results from the cache

What if the count changes between pages view? What if there are millions of
records -- awfully big fetch. What if you change the application down the
road, which creates the potential for changes in row count between views?
Lot's of state info to think about....

My two cents...

Hello,

I've been struggling w/this issue lately. I looked into the PEAR library,
and started writing a wrapper for it.

Does anyone have some good open source code or know of  a 3rd party lib
that does pagination?

You don't need to do an extra count query. If you are using MySQL,
just add SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS to your select query.
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM ...

You can then run SELECT FOUND_ROWS() to get the total rows without any
limits. It's still 2 queries, but the second one is essentially free.

You hardly need a library for figuring out pagination. A very simple
formula tells you how many "pages" you have.
$itemsPerPage = 10;
$totalRecords = 52; //Result of SELECT FOUND_ROWS()
$pages = ceil($totalRecords/$itemsPerPage);

Based on those numbers, you know you have 6 pages of data. You can
then create a loop to generate the links with the proper parameter(s),
however you want to format them.
For example:
link.php?page=3&itemsperpage=10

Would make the following query:
SELECT * FROM table LIMIT ($_GET['page']-1)*10,10

I may be off by 1 on that. Hope that helps.

Hello Brent,

Sure, I guess that's a fine way to do it.
I'll just toss it into a class for reuseability.

Here's my version of such a class:
http://dev.dellsala.com/source/Pager.phps

An example of how it might be used:

$pager = new Pager();
$pager->setItemsPerPage(10);
$pager->setCurrentPage(2);	// from $_POST or $_GET

// generate your query LIMIT
$sqlLimit = "LIMIT {$pager->getItemOffset()}, {$pager->getItemsPerPage 
()}";

$pager->setItemCount(125);	// from SELECT FOUND_ROWS(). thanks brent!

// output the paging interface
?>
<p>Page <?php echo $pager->getCurrentPage(); ?> of <? echo $pager- 
 >getPageCount(); ?></p>
<a href="search.php?page=<?php echo $pager->getPreviousPage(); ? 
 >">Previous</a>
<a href="search.php?page=<?php echo $pager->getNextPage(); ?>">Next</a>

Totally agree.

But when time = money, and time is short, I've found Pear::Pager to  
be a good starting place. The actual HTML output is horrible, but it  
works, and you can have a sliding or jumping number set, and set a  
delta for the links as well:

Two sources of code:

1. EZSql (if you are using that library) has a library for paging.
2. PHP Cookbook has some code you can use. There's lots of other good stuff
in there too.

Every time I implement paging for search results I end up using
different approaches, but I'm never happy with any of them. Am I
missing a simpler, more "correct" solution here? Here's what I've tried:


1) TWO-QUERY APPROACH

on every page view:

- step 1: execute search query with a "SELECT count(*) " to get the
total record count

- step 2: run the search again with the appropriate LIMIT clause to
retrieve the records I need for the current page



2) ONE QUERY, SEEK TO RESULTS

on every page view:

- step 1: execute search query

- step 2: use *_data_seek() to move to the right slice of results for
the current page



3) ONE QUERY, CACHE EVERYTHING

on the first page view:

- execute search query, fetch all results, and cache them

on every other page view:

- retrieve the right slice of results from the cache

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Character set issues revisited
Message-ID: <C33E63FA.90E5%cliff@pinestream.com>

There was recently a thread about some character set problem. I just found a
similar issue. I just transferred a site from a Windows XP dev. platform to
rhel. Everything looks fine except for a few special characters.

Windows   -> rhel
it?s           -> it?s
?            -> ? (should be the long dash, an em I think)
?blahblah? -> ?blahblah?
?                  -> ?

In phpMyAdmin I see: can?t
In my app, I see: can?t
So phpMyAdmin is displaying things correctly on either platform.

Page Headers:
My page: <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;
charset=iso-8859-1"> (on both windows & rhel)
phpMyadmin: <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"  content="text/html;
charset=utf-8" />

The charset headers are the same on both machine. I might have mistakenly
imported some of the database files with the wrong collation setting, but I
change it to be the same on both platforms. And these errors appear on
pages/code that was brought in via subversion, not the database.

Where should I start looking? What is the best charset to use anyway?
Iso-8859-1 or utf-8?

Thanks,
Cliff

Hey Cliff,

That's actually not a character encoding issue. The '?' or an empty
box is commonly displayed whenever a glyph associated with a character
value is not available. Meaning the client doesn't have the necessary
font. Also meaning, whatever editor was used to input those single
quotes didn't input the more common ASCII single quote character value
of 0x27. If you hexdump that content you'll see it's something else
(it will probably be a multibyte UTF-8 secquence which when decoded
will give you a Unicode value that you can lookup in Adobe's glyph
tables).

This is the sort of thing that happends when you create some content
with a word processor and then copy and paste it into the web page.

The way to fix this problem is to just seek and destory all of those
characters and replace them with their more common equivalent values
(e.g. the single quote 0x27 ASCII value).

Or you could install whatever wacked out font that has that character
on every client that will ever visit the page but that's probably not
the more desirable solution.

>  In phpMyAdmin I see: can't

That's odd. Maybe phpMyAdmin is doing some transliteration.

>  Where should I start looking? What is the best charset to use anyway?
> Iso-8859-1 or utf-8?

Look at the page with hexdump to see verify what the encoding is and
what the unicode value of one of the errant characters really is. Then
you can start to figure out where things went wrong.

Most of these frameworks have their own lists which are more useful for 
asking questions on than here. That said, its always useful to discuss 
those here with developers NOT using your framework of choice, if only to 
have another prespective to bounce ideas off.

Oh, and Im all for adding things to the Subject: headers to easier filter 
stuff.

I like the subject idea and will do it anyway in the hopes others find
it helpful.

Another idea - why not have one NYPHP meet centered around frameworks,
and have a framework-fest of sorts? I'd love to see a handful of
people talk about their experiences, compare notes with others and see
what some of the advantages/disadvantages are between them.

Mike:

Thanks. This is helpful. Here's another interesting puzzle. Why does the
page info in FireFox say encoding: UTF-8 while the Content-Type is
charset=iso-8859-1.

Ah, I think I see it. The encoding is how the page was saved. And as usual,
Microsoft butchers everything.

But this is php -- the page is dynamically generated. So is the encoding
picked up from my php script, index.php, or the template file index.tpl?

Boston PHP was going to do this and ultimately decided against it.  
Maybe Mark Withington will chime in here and tell us something about why.

I think it came down to logistics.  You really need a few hours for 
this, with refreshments, because people are going to be settling in and 
coding.  Restaurants and bars are out of the question, the venue has to 
allow us to stay into the late hours if people get really involved.

Note that even if you set the content-type header to ISO-8859-1 it's
still very possible generate page content in some other encoding. For
example, databases are pretty much put out what you put in so if you
have an "admin.php" putting data in in UTF-8 and all your other pages
are doing ISO-8859-1 w/ data from the DB the data from the DB will be
in UTF-8 and non-ASCII characters will not be encoded properly.

> Ah, I think I see it. The encoding is how the page was saved. And as usual,
> Microsoft butchers everything.

Actually if you right click on the page in FF and select "page info" I
think it should tell you the real encoding emitted by the server (the
content-type header).

Note that the META content-type tag in a page is basically ignored
unless the page is read from disk.

Also, note that if you're serving static content, the web server has a
default Content-Type encoding which is usually UTF-8. So if you have
some pages that are encoded in ISO-8859-1 and the web server is UTF-8
the web server will send Content-Type UTF-8 but the page will actually
still be encoded in ISO-8859-1 and the page will not be rendered
properly.

The browser will interpret the page based on the Content-Type
encoding. Period. But it's up to *you* to make sure the page is really
encoded in that encoding. It sounds like the script files are actually
the wrong encoding or contain funky characters. The easiest way to
determin if that is the case is to run hexdump or a hex editor and
look at one of the script files with a non-ASCII character in it. If
that character is encoded with one byte, then the encoding is
ISO-8850-x. If the character is encoded with two or more bytes, it's
probably UTF-8.

Note that if you have a lot of pages in the wrong encoding you might
want to look into the iconv utility found on *nix machines.

I think people are trying to diagnose a problem with incomplete
information.  There are a bunch of places where things can go wrong
with character encoding, and without the details it is impossible to
know what is going on.

What is the collation of the column in the database? (available in phpmyadmin)

What is the value of the "Content-Type" header? (use firebug to determine)

Which mysql drivers are you using? mysql,mysqli, pdo

Are you calling mysql('set names ...') anywhere?

Do you have a <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" ..> tag?

And by '?' do you mean '?' or '?' ... there is a big difference.

My guess is that you are using utf8 as the database collation, and you
need to remove your meta tag, call mysql_query("set names utf-8") as
soon as you create a connection to the database, and add a
header("Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8"); to all scripts.

But again, that is a guess since I only have about 20% of the relevant info.

Hope that helps.

John Campbell

Message-ID: <1822385224.20071020104734@qualityadvantages.com>

Greetings and Hello,

I am converting a script to use SMTP if php mail() is not available
for the users of this script. I have all the active calls working so
that if my smtp flag is set it automatically switches to smtp and
sends the message with the appropriate headers etc. but part of the script is run by a
cron job and I see a php mail call but don't quite understand the syntax.
Anyone care to take a guess at translating what it does?

It is part of a while loop and I think its combining two conditions
into one statement but would like confirmation.

here is the code fragment:

if ( !mail( $row['Email'], $row[Subj], $row[Body], "From: $site[email_notify]", "-f$site[email_notify]") )
++$err;


I thinks this is the equivalent of:

if ( !mail( $row['Email'], $row[Subj], $row[Body], "From: $site[email_notify]", "-f$site[email_notify]") )
{
++$err;  //update the error queue
}
else
{
mail( $row['Email'], $row[Subj], $row[Body], "From: $site[email_notify]", "-f$site[email_notify]");
}


Has anyone seen or used this technique before? This is the first time
I have seen it used, though this script has a lot of short cuts that
make the code difficult to debug sometimes, like this one.

Thanks in advance for your comments,

I believe you are correct except for the else.? The if statement can be written that way, but it will not do the else statement you put in your example, you would include that...

http://us.php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php#control-structures.if

This is a good link to learn how to write the shorter version of the if statement.? However, I like writing it out... old school.




I thinks this is the equivalent of:

if ( !mail( $row['Email'], $row[Subj], $row[Body], "From: $site[email_notify]", 
"-f$site[email_notify]") )
{
++$err;  //update the error queue
}
else
{
mail( $row['Email'], $row[Subj], $row[Body], "From: $site[email_notify]", 
"-f$site[email_notify]");
}

The "equivalent" you wrote should generally result in sending either  
zero or two emails ... which is probably not what you want.

The code you're trying to grok is simply "send mail and if there's an  
error, increment the error counter".  A slightly more obvious way for  
writing it would be:

$result = mail(...);
if (! $result){
	++$err;
}

The way you re-wrote it, it says "send mail and if there's an error  
increment the error counter.  If there isn't an error, send the mail  
a second time".

You are reinventing the wheel by writing your own smtp code. I use  
swiftmailer (http://www.swiftmailer.org/) when I need a script that  
is going to send out emails on a regular basis. Another option is  
phpmailer (http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/), but that's not really  
being updated anymore. Both are free and handle SMTP extremely well.

John, Michael:

What is the difference? I have seen both?

If anyone else is struggling with this, John and Michael have great points.
There are some great articles on Wikepedia and Sitepoint regarding this
issue. Essentially, you need to look at the entire "publishing" chain --
from text editors, to database to php to Apache to the browser....

In my case, this narrowed down to a few problem areas.

1. I conveniently "grabbed" some special characters from a windows editor.
When, where? Who knows. But it's obvious. Lord knows I couldn't figure out
how to get that special squiggle thing any other way.

2. ISO-8859 and Windows-1252 char set are very, very similar. Naturally,
it's all those lovely special characters that are the difference. From
Wikepedia: "It is very common to mislabel text data with the charset label
ISO-8859-1, even though the data is really Windows-1252 encoded."

3. My pages were encoded as utf-8 -- the Apache default. Sure, I set the
meta tag to 8859. Not enough -- use:
 header('Content-type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1');

4. I still have some of those special characters, and I know they are not in
the 8859 char set, yet things are look'n fine. Puzzling, eh. Why? From
Wikepedia:

"Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control
codes as Windows-1252 characters in order to accommodate such mislabeling
but it is not a standard behaviour and care should be taken to avoid
generating these characters in ISO-8859-1 labeled content."

5. And this is big!!!
I use the Firefox html validator plug-in to validate my pages. It uses Tidy.
My pages came up as perfect -- till this problem hit when I switched
platforms. Yet, when I ran them through the W3c validator, it barfed all
over them.

Use http://validator.w3.org to validate your pages.

Cliff

If there's interest in this, we could probably provide space.  Noteably, we
could have the back room at Suspenders where we can code, eat and drink
until they close.

It's most relevant to PHP IMHO.

'?' is typically caused by storing the data in Mysql as UTF-8, and
then a magical undocumented feature in the php mysql drivers auto
converts it to 8859-1.  Thus if you have a character that is not in
8859-1 (e.g. a korean character) mysql will convert it to a '?'.  A
'?' is generated by the browser when the browser is trying to render
as UTF-8 and it comes across an invalid byte sequence.

The first thing to understand about character encoding is the overlap
between UTF-8 and 8859-1.  Below is a sample
a - lower case a (Same in 8859-1 & UTF-8)
? - a acute (Available in 8859-1 & UTF8 but different values..)
? - Chinese character (Not in 8859-1, in UTF-8)

These days, you should really do everything in UTF-8.  There was a lot
of talk about PHP not being UTF-8 safe, but it is largely nonsense and
primarily because developers don't think about other languages.  I
personally never see the need for functions like substr, and I don't
use regular expressions like [a-zA-Z0-9].

One other piece of advice, is don't ever use that stupid meta tag to
specify the content encoding.  It makes no sense to specify the
encoding of the content in the content itself.  The content encoding
should be specified in the header and only in the header.

John Campbell

Message-ID: <e065b8610710220645y219280b0qcb2d462b7d84b606@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All:

We currently have PHP 5.2.4 installed on our web server. It was
compiled and installed with PHP MySQL library version 4.1.22 and our
MySQL Server version is 5.0.45. Until yesterday this hadn't caused us
any problems, but I believe it is now the source of the following
error:

Unable to bind arguments to query: Using unsupported buffer type: 0
(parameter: 1)

My question is, How should I go about recompiling our PHP install with
a newer MySQL library? Do I need to make any changes to Apache once
this is done? If anyone could point me to a step by step guide I'd be
much obliged.

Thanks,
- jake

Do you have the original files used to build your PHP and Apache?

If you do, it should be a simple matter of just rebuilding PHP and then 
rebuilding Apache afterwards.

If you dont have the sources used to build it, then you will need to 
figure out the configuration of your exiting PHP install (phpinfo() is 
your friend) and use that to figure out the flags to give to thwe 
configure script to build it.

Same for Apache.

Hello All, 

I still used table based layouts. I try to remove all my style attributes and place them in .css files.
However, I still haven't made the jump from table to div based layouts.

I've looked at a few books, but haven't found one that really drove the point home.
I have no formal HTML experiance, I just write it to get stuff done. So, can anyone
recommend a great book for div/css? 

Good websites are fine too, but the lack of depth in most online articles/whitepapers
about the topic leaves me wanting more.

Thanks,

I have only checked out a couple of CSS books, but they were both really
helpful. Bulletproof Web Design, and CSS Mastery. I'd recommend both of
them. Bulletproof does some simple things, but the ideas are good to
have. CSS Mastery covers more complicated layouts and such.

Ben,

 

This is list of articles that I have read in learning how to implement div
elements into what would have been a table layout.

Hope it helps.

First thing Id do is grab php-5.2.4 and mysql 5.0.45 sources and  
untar to /usr/local/src so you have them in case they are not there  
or outdated.

Run "php -i | grep configure" and copy that to a handy file  
somewhere, it shows how your current php bin was built.  Look for the  
mysql directives ...

./configure --help | grep mysql
   --with-mysql[=DIR]      Include MySQL support. DIR is the MySQL  
base directory
   --with-mysql-sock[=DIR]   MySQL: Location of the MySQL unix socket  
pointer.
   --with-mysqli[=FILE]    Include MySQLi support.  FILE is the  
optional pathname
                           to mysql_config [mysql_config]
   --enable-embedded-mysqli  MYSQLi: Enable embedded support
   --with-pdo-mysql[=DIR]    PDO: MySQL support. DIR is the MySQL  
base directory

Your configure should already point to apxs for your apache setup so  
you don't need to do anything w/ apache except restart when the  
recompile is done.

When I did this before I learned my lesson of symlinking up versions  
of mysql (and php) so I could easily rollback.

BTW, was mysql compiled in or is it shared?  From what I recall if it  
is shared you can also jump into /ext/mysql and run phpize,  
configure, make and swap out the extension in php.ini.  This would of  
course be a possibly less secure method.

Ben,

If you're productive and just looking to move over to div layouts, I 
suggest you query the "CSS Box model" and study that concept first. It's 
the math behind page layout using divs, and IMHO you need it first in 
order to be productive no matter how you approach CSS for layout. There 
are two "box models" described on the web: the CSS box model for HTML 
elements, and the concept of page layout as a series of nested "boxes".

Layout the page box model properly, and everything else seems to flow 
logically and comfortably. Not completely clear on the box model, and 
everything can seem like a P.I.T.A.

This is a very good article on the box model behind CSS, but scan all 
the pages  http://www.brainjar.com/css/positioning/
Visual people like this simple demo for the HTML element box model 
concept. http://redmelon.net/tstme/box_model/
and I like to go here for page layouts according to box model (page 
level) http://glish.com/css/
but they are not the latest. For the latest, as always you go to the CSS 
lists.

Hope that helps.

Rebuilding PHP by itself doesn't rebuild mod_php right?

Mike, thanks for a very thorough reply.  I did as you suggested, turned 
off that option in OO.org, did a search-and-replace on existing docs, 
and for the moment this allows me to ignore the mismatched encodings.

I am testing my production site, and something seems to be very wrong. I
just loaded my homepage and it took 53.46 seconds. Clearly unacceptable for
a production web site. And there should be zero load on the site, since
no-one knows about it. One 775 byte image took 23 seconds. A 51byte image
took 6 seconds. The main script took 28 seconds. Pulling in a 60K javascript
file took 10 seconds.

When accessing the page a second time, where the images and Javascript are
pulled from the browser cache, the load time is typically a more respectable
250msec ? about what I would expect.

I know the script is fast ? for the homepage there is barely any load at
all. The site seems to be choking on the static content. There are a lot of
static images to download... Sure, I expect the static content to take a bit
of time to pull in, but 56 seconds?!

Are there setting in Apache (or elsewhere) that would stall the download of
multiple image files? Number of simultaneous connections, etc. Any idea for
how to debug this? I can debug php, for a slow static image? I?m clueless...

Thanks,
Cliff

As usual, answering my own question in real-time.

Item #1: KeepAlive is Off ? looks like this could be one potential problem
so far

Sounds like your server is sick.  If downloading a single sub-1k  
image is taking seconds upon seconds, something is seriously wrong.   
Do you have full control of the server, or is there someone at a  
hosting company that can look at this?  I wouldn't start worrying  
about apache settings (which are pretty reasonable out of the box)  
until you're sure that there's not some runaway process on the box  
chewing up all sorts of resources, or (probably more likely) some  
local network issue near the server.

Hi Cliff,

Are you doing remote access of DB, images, or scripts? Recently DNS resolution
with a freshly created site caused me 7-10 second access times to a
remote database.

Big-fat, honking dedicated, but was ready to switch to $3.95 shared.

KeepAlive was off -- turning it on appears to have solved the problem.

Have a look at the site with the YSlow plugin for Firefox.   It tests your 
site agains list of best practices from the performance guys at Yahoo:
http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/

You may also experience better performance if you offload your static 
files to a different hostname, e.g., www.example.org and img.example.org.  
This gets around maximum simultaneous connections to one server in the 
visitor's browser.

No remote access -- everything is coming from the server.

Hi

I was wondering if anybody knows? I am sure that others must have 
encountered this in the past. What I am trying to accomplish is a 
conditional exit from the current script,  go to and execute another script 
without any manual intervention. Using the following pseudo code, I am fully 
aware it is not elegant but it serves to explain what I want to accomplish.

If $Cost  <  100 goto and execute script-a.php
    else
          if $Cost  >  1000 goto and execute script-b.php
             else
                   carry on;

Normally I would be happy to supply real PHP coding but unfortunately I do 
not know how to execute what I want to.

The simplest way I can think of is:

if($Cost < 100)
{
   include('script-a.php');
   exit();
}
else if($Cost > 1000)
{
   include('script-b.php');
   exit();
}
// if the above two "exit's" didn't get invoked, rest of the script will be
processed.
.
.

You can use the HTML header redirect
header("location:http://www.myserver.gov/script-a.php");
and send the browser to a different script. That will work only if you haven't 
sent output to the browser yet.

Another option ...

switch(TRUE) {
   case($cost < 100): include("a.php"); break;
   case($cost > 1000): include("b.php");  break;
   default: break;
}

A small clarification -- it's not really overlap, 
but rather UTF-8 is a super-set containing 8859-1 
like both contain ASCII.

Other than that minor clarification, you've been spot-on with your advice.

Well if you want to be pedantic about it, "overlap" is more accurate.
UTF-8 is a multibyte encoding of the Unicode charset. ISO-8859-1 is a
single byte encoding of the ISO-8859-1 charset. So yes, Unicode is a
superset of ISO-8859-1 but the UTF-8 encoding of values above 0x7f are
not the same.

Yes it does, if you passed the right arguments to configure. Remember
that there are two different ways to build mod_php based on whether
you're using Apache 1.x or Apache 2.x...

Based on your pseudo code, I am probably assuming you want to terminate
the rest of the current script when it conditionally branches to one of
your branch scripts. If so, make sure it does. 

Your pseudo code should more closely resemble the below statements if
what I presumed is correct. 

=======================================================================
//script begin
//script code common to all conditions...
If ($cost < 100) {
    //execute branch script-a.php (could be with a header statement)
    //exit current script
} else if ($cost > 1000) {
    //execute branch script-b.php (could be with a header statement)
    //exit current script
} else {
    //carry on with the rest of the script. 
}
...
//script code only applicable to the third 'default' case if any
//script end
========================================================================

You can also consider an alternative approach based on Jon's solution
that obviates the need for specific exit statements with header()
redirections (and the additional work that may be involved with pushing
potential GET/POST data you want to send to that redirected script if
you are not or decide not to pass the data via session variables).

//script begin
//common script code applicable to all three cases...
Switch (true) {
  Case ($cost < 100):
      include 'script-a.php';
      break;
  Case ($cost > 1000)
      include 'script-b.php';
      Break;
  Default:
      //Put in all specific statements that need to be executed
      //when $cost fails to meet above two conditions
}
//common script code applicable to all three cases
//end of script

Ali Mohammed.

Yes, I want to second that and congratulate Elliotte on a very well
put-together demonstration.

I believe the slides can be found here:
http://www.cafeconleche.org/slides/nyphp/xquery/01.html

I work in the medical industry, and I've seen a lot of
not-so-rectangular data stuffed into rectangular holes (see the NYPHP
thread on "Flexible Forms" back in May, for example) and XML seems as
if it would provide a nice alternative.

The only thing that makes me hesitate is the relative infancy of the
open source DB's available. I would have to be convinced that they are
stable, long-term solutions, and so far I'm not seeing that. Some of
the hybrid solutions out there, however, look quite viable.

Again, thanks for the talk, Elliotte.

If it's a relatively simple query that makes use of indexes, then  
it's going to be faster to do a separate count(0) query instead of  
SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS.  I confirmed with some gurus at the recent mysql  
camp that SQL_CAL_FOUND_ROWS is faster than count(0) if it's a  
complex search query (i.e. where clauses/joins on non-indexed columns).

My guess is that two queries would be faster if only the indexes
needed to be accessed. Meaning it would not need to read from the main
data file to determine the result set, just the index file. This would
be especially true of InnoDB based tables.

Message-ID: <471FBAD6.5000701@npgroup.net>

This is a little bit off topic, but I'm wondering how the group feels 
about running servers off of VMWare.  I have a social networking site 
currently with about 1M+ uniques/mo.  Runs on php5/MySQL.  I've been 
toying with moving to servers hosted on VMWare and load balanced.  
Anyone have any experiences, pros, cons of installing such an architecture?

Thanks,

What kind of hardware will you be running on? I presume you're talking about
ESX INfrastructure, and not VMware Server, yes?

What hosted OS do you want to use?

There have been recent issues running Linux on VMWare--you have to
configure 2.6 kernels not to hit the clock so hard, a fairly easy fix
in recent versions. I still saw above average clock skew on mine
(30-40 seconds over 24 hours), but ymmv. I've never tried to put one
under production load.

I like virtualization a lot for simple things like proxys and mirrors,
which I'm happy to let somebody else host. There are a lot of folks
doing VPS. My advice is to find a host that allows you to build your
own images, and stay away from the "web control panel" unless you have
time to audit it. Check out Amazon's EC2, also.

At my office we run some FreeBSD virtual machines in VMWare and serve  
some PHP web applications including Plesk and some custom apps. As  
long as you have decent hardware for it it's not really a problem,  
but be careful with your clock - there are some tweaks you need to  
perform to keep the virtual server clock in sync with the real clock.  
NTP helps but if you don't adjust some RTC settings the clock will be  
horribly skewed (this is with 6.1, not sure about more recent  
versions). In terms of PHP performance I haven't noticed any  
significant issues.

Im using linode.com to host a vitual mail/webmail server (they use UML for 
virtualization). Their control panel allows you to build a disk image from 
among 10 Linux distributions and then boot it as a VPS. You can then ssh 
into it and build your server software as normal.

You also have console access by ssh'ing into the host server for your VPS 
where you're connected to the virtual console via a screen session.

Disk space, memory and IP address upgrades are managed through software 
that upgrades your VPS (which you can then reboot through the control 
panel).

I thought this is a nice way to run your own server without the hardware 
worries. Just passing on my positive experience.

You are free to call it what you want.

True, the code-points for the ISO-8859-1 charset 
above 0x7F (the M$ spin) are not the same as 
UTF-* et al, but the glyphs are still included in 
UFT-8 regardless of encoding differences -- is 
that not true?

If this is true, then the term "overlap" would be 
less correct than "super-set" because the two 
sets do not overlap with respect to all 
code-points -- but the larger one still contain 
all the glyphs that the smaller one does (for the 
exception of Apple's spin on that set, which 
included adding their logo).

That's the reason I'm free to call one a super-set of the the other.

I believe it's easier to explain char-sets and 
code-points in terms of current Unicode standards 
than it is to point out historical differences 
that are diminishing in importance as more people 
convert.

Cheers,

tedd

You'd need to provide some code samples for us to give you some advice. Also, 
what do you consider the difference between "creating a source image" and "go 
to the location where all of the images are and display them"? I'd establish a 
place where all images are (as appears to be given in your case), then write a 
script that creates pages with <img> tags that point to the image in the 
specific location.

I created and still work on a very similar system with a database backend that 
allows for quite complex searches and a bunch of other stuff.

Basically, you need to tell us what you did so that we can tell you what you 
did wrong.

Just adding on David's answer -- put the name/path of the image in a variable in your database.  I've done it because the name of the image matches the name of the record entry so it's easy to locate the correct image to display through a query.  Let's say the business is Susan so my logo for the business is named susan.jpg which I can easily locate in a query.

Putting image paths in a database would only work if you know beforehand
the path and name of all the images you want displayed (not to mention
the unreasonable overhead of updating that database for additional
images added or existing image files renamed later on). What you would
want, if David's assumption is correct, is to automatically read the
names of all image files contained in a given path location at the time
of script execution , and then loop through each of the names and
display the appropriate html img tag for each of these images.

 

IMHO, you could adopt for a simpler approach by using the concept of
<google_for_more_info>directory browsing in php</google_for_more_info>.
The pseudo code of one possible way (among several others) would be
something like this (hopefully assuming you are not stuck in a chrooted
web jail). 

 

function displayallimages($imagepathlocation) {

    $listoffiles = system("ls " . $imagepathlocation); 

     //filter $listoffiles to contain an array list of only valid image
files based on allowable image file extensions

    foreach($listoffiles as $imgfile) 

        echo '<img src='.$imgepathlocation.'/'.$imgfile.'/>'; //make
sure the image path here is relative to the document root of the web
server

}

 

Or at least I think that is one way to do it.

Just adding on David's answer -- put the name/path of the image in a
variable in your database.  I've done it because the name of the image
matches the name of the record entry so it's easy to locate the correct
image to display through a query.  Let's say the business is Susan so my
logo for the business is named susan.jpg which I can easily locate in a
query.

You'd need to provide some code samples for us to give you some advice.
Also, 
what do you consider the difference between "creating a source image"
and "go 
to the location where all of the images are and display them"? I'd
establish a 
place where all images are (as appears to be given in your case), then
write a 
script that creates pages with <img> tags that point to the image in the

specific location.

I created and still work on a very similar system with a database
backend that 
allows for quite complex searches and a bunch of other stuff.

Basically, you need to tell us what you did so that we can tell you what
you 
did wrong.

The one does not exclude the other. What I used to do in my picture viewer is 
go through the dirs, get the paths, and write those to the db (although "new 
guy" did not specify if he/she even uses a database, being new to PHP I doubt 
it a bit). You can then look at each file and check if you can extract exif 
information, at least the image size so that the page build is a bit faster.
I later dropped parsing dir listings as I do not see why I want to dump just a 
bunch of files into some spot, I rather have then roughly sorted by year and 
month. I now upload a ZIP archive, read the file names into an array, unpack 
the archive to a temporary location, then go through the pile of files, 
determine if it is indeed an image (oh, still have to write that part), get 
some of the exif info, and dump it into the db with a marker set so that I can 
later find these images and properly title them, set the rotation, add tags, 
and fix the creation date if it wasn't available through exif.

I believe the simple way would to be to store a path in a database.  Here is
an example of an upload procedure to add files to the directory (must be
world writeable though and does not provide for mime types, just extension
checks since mime_content_type() and PEAR extensions might not be an option
on shared hosting).

<?php
/*
 * Created on Oct 14, 2007
 *
 * This application uploads a photo to be used for the profile.  The image
 * will be no larger than 250 x 250 pixels.  If the image is not of type
gif/jpeg/png
 * the user will be asked to upload a new photo that meets the requirements,
additionally
 * the max file size for a picture upload is two megabytes.
 */
// pre: cookie is set for user id, source image is uploaded and mime type is
checked
// post: db is updated with link to profile photo
function buildImage($userId, $srcImage, $extension)
{
	$uploadDir = './images/profilePhotos/';
	// try to make sure no one has a collision of profile files
	$uploadFile = $uploadDir . md5($_SESSION['id']);

	// get our image dimensions so we can calculate a resize/aspect
ratio
	list($width,$height) = getimagesize($srcImage);
	
	// check what axis we are going to calculate our resize ratio from
	if($width > $height)
	{
		$ratio = 250/$width;
		$newWidth = 250;
		$newHeight = $height * $ratio;
	}
	else
	{
		$ratio = 250/$height;
		$newWidth = $width * $ratio;
		$newHeight = 250;
	}
	
	// create an image resource from the temp uploaded file
	if($extension == 'jpeg')
	{
		$image = imagecreatefromjpeg($srcImage);
	}
	elseif($extension == 'gif')
	{
		$image = imagecreatefromgif($srcImage);
	}
	elseif($extension == 'png')
	{
		$image = imagecreatefrompng($srcImage);
	}
	else
	{
		//output an error for extensions checks and die()
	}

	
	// create an image resource with the new dimensions
	$resizedImage = imagecreatetruecolor($newWidth, $newHeight);
	// copy the image with resampling
	imagecopyresampled($resizedImage, $image, 0, 0, 0, 0, $newWidth,
$newHeight, $width, $height);
	// save the resized image resource to a file
	
	// create an image resource from the temp uploaded file
	if($extension == 'jpeg')
	{
		imagejpeg($resizedImage, $uploadFile.".".$extension, 100);
	}
	elseif($extension == 'gif')
	{
		imagegif($resizedImage, $uploadFile.".".$extension);
	}
	else
	{
		imagepng($resizedImage, $uploadFile.".".$extension);
	}

	// update the database with the new image link
	// query data from the database for use in building the page
	$dbh = mysql_connect("localhostorIPofhost", "putyourusernamehere",
"putyourpasswordhere");
	// select the database
 	mysql_select_db("anthonyw_mystory");
	$query = sprintf("UPDATE `anthonyw_mystory`.`users` SET
`profilePhoto` = '%s' WHERE `users`.`id` ='%s' LIMIT
1",$uploadFile.".".$extension,$userId);
 	// make change in database
 	$results = mysql_query($query);
 	// close the database connection
 	mysql_close($dbh);
	// return them back to the lobby;
	include './lobby.php';
}
 
	// the only way we can get to this script is when someone submits
	// a form submission to this script
	
	// copy their userID
	session_start();
	$userId = $_SESSION['id'];
	
	// since mime_content_type or fileinfo are not available we must
rely on the browser
	// and see if it has uploaded the mime type of the file
	$mimeString = $_FILES['userfile']['type'];
	
	// now test the mime string for varying different types
	if(strpos($mimeString,"jpeg") || strpos($mimeString,"jpg"))
	{
		$mimeType = 'jpeg';
	}
	elseif(strpos($mimeString,"gif"))
	{
		$mimeType = 'gif';
	}
	elseif(strpos($mimeString,"png"))
	{
		$mimeType = 'png';
	}
	else
	{
		$mimeType = 'invalid';
	}
	
	buildImage($userId, $_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $mimeType);
?>

And this is how I pull the file out for an image wrapped in an 'img' tag:

"<img src=\"".$row['profilePhoto']."\">"

But this assumes that $row is a successful mysql_query.  There are
additional functions if you know that the extension they can display images
or image resources: imagejpeg(), imagegif(), imagepng().  I did not include
the actual HTML form as I am assuming you can google that or look it up on
PHP.net

Hello,

Here's some code I'm using to store user's avatars. I have the paths' mapped 
to
defines. It removes the original image and converts to png (which is 
hardwired)
and then saves JUST the filename to the database (since I know the path, 
DEFINE).

I use the PEAR FileUpload( ) Class to take care of moving the files.
and the ImageTransform( ) (which is some kinda derivation of the PEAR 
Image_Transform() class)
to resize the image.

Thatttsss it!

        if ( $stateObject->Get('do_avatar') == TRUE )
        {
            $uploadObject = new FileUpload(0666);
            $fileName = $uploadObject->MoveFile(USER_IMAGES_PATH, 
'uploadImage');

            if ( $fileName == PROC_FAILURE )
            {   /* There has been an unrecoverable error. */
                error_log(USER_IMAGES_PATH . ' directory does not exist');
            }

            $imageObject = new ImageTransform( );
            $imageObject->sourceFile = USER_IMAGES_PATH . $fileName;

            $newFileName  = substr($fileName, 0, strrpos($fileName,"."));
            $newFileName .= '.png';

            $imageObject->targetFile = USER_IMAGES_PATH . $newFileName;

            $imageObject->resizeToHeight = 90;
            $imageObject->resizeToWidth  = 110;

            if ( !$imageObject->resize( ) )
            {
                error_log($imageObject->error);
            }

            /* Remove the uploaded image. */
            unlink(USER_IMAGES_PATH . $fileName);

            /* Update the users thumbnail in the database. */
            $dbObject->DatabaseQuery('UPDATE ' . DATABASE_TABLE_USERS
                . ' SET thumbnail = ' . $dbObject->Safe($newFileName)
                . ' WHERE username = '
                . $dbObject->Safe($sessionObject->Get(SESSION_USER))
                . ' AND email = '
                . $dbObject->Safe($sessionObject->Get(SESSION_EMAIL))
                . ' AND id = '
                . $dbObject->Safe($sessionObject->Get(SESSION_DBID)),
                RETURN_NONE, LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG);

            $avatarImage = $newFileName;
        }
        .....keeps going.....

Thanks everybody for all your suggestions. Sorry it has taken so long for me to reply, but I ran into another one of those mysterious error codes which for some odd reason spontaneously appeared where everything was previously working.

 

Now that that is out of the way I can once again concentrate the automatic redirection of PHP scripts. Once again thanks for your help.

I don't agree with that for a couple of reasons. One) redundant data; 
Two) what path? The path you're using today or the one you change to 
later?

I think it is far better practice to just store the names in the dB 
and then to provide the path as needed. That way you can move your dB 
and files anywhere you want without having to rewrite the paths in 
your dB -- and you don't have that redundant path to the file name 
appearing throughout your data.

Cheers,

tedd

Message-ID: <001301c81976$c424f1d0$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello all,


#1 Thanks for the ideas on CSS (my last question). I still haven't been able to invest the type of time
I would like to play around with the code, but I will. I got the CSS Mastery book and I've got an APress
book on HTML/CSS design patterns. Both look promising.

I started off doing db deployment code in a seperate file, say createdb.php that I would run from
the URL.

include ('PROS.php');
    include ('../LIBRARY/DBAS.php');

    DBAS_InitDBHandle(PROS_SQLInfo( ), 'PROS.php', $db);
    DBAS_MySQLUseDB(constPROSDBStr, $db);
    
    $tableSet = DBAS_FetchTables(constPROSDBStr, $db);
    if ( @ !$tableSet[constContentStr]) 
    {
        error_log("createdb.php: creating 'content' table");
        $sqlStr = "CREATE TABLE content "

                . " page_img_1    varchar(64)   default '',"
                . " page_img_2    varchar(64)   default '',"
                . " img_1_caption  varchar(64)   default '',"
                . " img_2_caption  varchar(64)   default '',"
                . " img_1_alt      varchar(64)   default '',"

                . " link          varchar(64)   default '',"
                . " primary key(id)"
                . ')';
        DBAS_MySQLQuery($sqlStr, $db);
    }

After a while, that was kinda of a pain and I moved to something internal to the index.php?action=create_database file
and cleaned up my database object code.

        /* Comments table. */
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateTable(DATABASE_TABLE_COMMENTS);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField('comment_id', 'int(11)', 'NOT NULL',
                                       'auto_increment');
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField('video_id',    'int(11)',     DEF_0);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField('posted_time', 'varchar(32)', DEF_0);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField('posted_by',   $v64,          $defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField('comment',     'varchar(512)',$defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField('primary', 'key(comment_id)');
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateCommit(LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG);   

Which I used for a while and I liked it. Except its a lot to type for larger databases.
So I started messing with YAML and I've got my code down to this:

emails:
    id:
        type:    int(11)
        default: not null
        extra:   auto_increment
    email:
        type:    varchar(255)
        default: default 0
        extra:
    contacted:
        type:    tinyint(1)
        default: default 0
        extra:
    primary:
        type:    key(id, email)
        default: ""
        extra: 

Which I just feed into a method that creates the table. I have this code only execute 
when I pass a command line switch in, say php index.php -f db.yaml. If I don't have
CL access then I'd have to move it to the URL.

Do you all think agree this is a better direction ? What are some pitfalls I could run into 
doing db's this way?

Thanks so much!

Hi Ben,

Is it a requirement that you use PHP? MySQL database
creation/modification can be scripted by running mysql with the -e
switch and passing it a file containing SQL commands. I also add -vvv
to give me verbose output.

Hello PJ,

It is, only because I may not have CL access to certain hosts.

I've thought about using a sql file and a few people have mentioned
that too me as well.

I guess I need to have flexiblity.

It's the only way to fly!

The next enhancement would be conditional building.  Before the system 
builds a table, have it examine the server to see if the table exists, 
and then it should be smart enough to only add columns that need to be 
added.  From there you get into more complex issues like changes to 
column widths, changes to column types.  Then there are backfills....

In Andromeda this entire process is handled by "AndroBuild.php", which 
runs down the entire process, plus lots of other security and 
automation-related stuff.

None. 

Every computer program in the universe is meant to be moved from machine 
to machine.  When you move a database app you've got to have a mechanism 
to ensure the structures are correct.

IMHO it is the lack of these types of tools that is the main reason many 
people try to avoid getting rigorous with their database structures --

Rusty et al,

I had a great time at the XML database talk, it was very informative.  I 
have a few comments, questions, and suggestions.

First, I think after seeing the talk that I would have liked in the 
beginning to get a more complete description of the problem domain that 
XML databases are trying to solve.  Specific examples here would be very 
productive.  We know that publishing looms large here, what are some 
specific issues?  This would have made the code example more meaningful 
to me.

Second, there were ideas that came out during Q & A that might be 
expanded on to good purpose.  Things that we might not know or take for 
granted, like the philosophy regarding types and structures.  The 
audience seemed to be focusing on the need for structure, while the tool 
did not seem to want to do that.  A couple of slides outlined the 
philosophy of types and structures might have been useful here.

Finally, I would have liked to hear more of Rusty's ideas about the 
relationship between the file system, the web server, and the database.  
Rusty, do you want to expand on that here?

Hi,

While I have not had the opportunity to listen in person to this great
talk about XML database, I did have the good fortune of going through
the slides after somebody recently posted the online links for the
slides. 

At the risk of slightly sounding off topic (but it does base on
Kenneth's question on specific examples), I would like anybody's views
on the applicability of XML database to clinical databases where the
information that needs to be stored comes from a domain that is largely
undefined or unpredictable in advance (maybe the more precise term is
unstructured data but I am not too sure as I am amateur programmer
myself). I did have in the past developed clinical databases (data
captured from clinical trials) using the EAV model out of relational
tables. The queries turned out to be terribly slow so I was forced to
used a combination of true relational tables and EAV tables out of
hacked up relational tables. Even then, the performance levels sucked. 

I would appreciate it if you can throw light on what would be ideal
alternatives (instead of just relational databases) to storing such
disparate information items. Can object oriented database such as the
commercial Cache be a solution? Or XML databases perhaps?

Thanks in advance,
Ali Mohammed.

That made me wonder if most people completely missed the point. The
application of XML databases is, I think, in situations where
structure is either not applicable or not possible. Trying to stamp a
structure on an XML database (from what I can gather) destroys one of
the primary reasons for employing the technology. XML is flexible.
That's what makes it different. If you shoehorn an XML database into
what Rusty called a "rectangular" format, why not just continue using
relational databases?

As far as uses go, I was nodding the entire time that Rusty was
talking about the usefulness of structure-free systems in the medical
industry. I've worked in the medical industry almost exclusively for
seven years and there have been several times that I have had to force
data (documents, specifically) into relational formats that obviously
didn't work well. As Rusty pointed out, it makes a developer feel
dirty. I've seen "documents" tables with over two hundred columns, and
it took all sorts of work-arounds to fix the performance problems that
it caused. I've also seen the EAV format that Ali M. mentions in his
email. None of these solutions seem to fit the problem very well.

Rusty's presentation interested me because it seems to hold the best
answer I've seen yet to the free-flowing/constantly-changing data that
medical software has to deal with. I still don't feel that the (open
source, anyway) XML databases are a *mature* solution, but they
certainly hold a lot of promise for an industry afflicted with poor
containers to hold our data. The hybrid solutions hold the most
possibility, I think, because it meets the need for both structural
and non-structural data. I will be watching the maturation of the
available software with much more attention than I have before.

I don't think so. Rusty was a very engaged speaker - he was all over
the room. It would have been difficult to get an audio copy of the
talk.

XML documents are structured.
Look up well-formed XML and valid XML.

No need to 'stamp' a structure on XML records --
they've already got one (see above)

XML documents (and hence XML Databases) are not inherently
less structured or more capable of handling unstructured
data than a relational data model.
(Consider, for example, a database with a text field which
can be text-indexed like you can create in MySQL.
That sort of a text field doesn't impose much structure
on the data.)

A relational schema can be as structured or unstructured
as you create it to be -- same goes for DTD's and XSD's.
What degree of structure you need, I would venture to say,
is determined by your retrieval needs.

If you really want even less structure -- throw all
your data into text files and 'grep' for your
information.

Tim, I don't think I was clear.

We're differing on semantics here, but by "structure" I mean set
fields, e.g., an "employees" table would have:

first name
last name
hired date
etc.

An XML document doesn't have a field definition (unless you tell it
to, of course, using any of the methods you described).

I'm aware that XML has "structure" (in the sense it is well-formed).

A flat text file paired with grep doesn't have the same power because
fields would not be defined. XML, at least, conveys information about
the data contained in the field, whereas a completely unstructured
text document lacks that.

Just got a chance to check it out... I'm using the build dated 20071001.

Definitely some things to be worked out with the templates.  For  
example, the first thing I saw was the index.phtml view which has a  
line break before the doctype.  I'm pretty sure that immediately  
sends IE (at least IE6) into quirks mode.

> It looks like the index.php file is out of place
Actually... I think it's in the right place... the docroot for the  
webserver would be set to the html directory which correctly  
separates the main application code from public access... but the  
include path is incorrect:

Change:
set_include_path('.' . PATH_SEPARATOR . './library' .  
PATH_SEPARATOR . './application/models/' . PATH_SEPARATOR .  
get_include_path());
To:
set_include_path('..' . PATH_SEPARATOR . '../library' .  
PATH_SEPARATOR . '../application/models/' . PATH_SEPARATOR .  
get_include_path());

Right?

Yeah... when I do new controller/view/etc... it places it in whatever  
folder I initiated it from -- or makes me enter a path if I do it  
from the main menu.

The Zend View and Zend Model don't seem to be any different than a  
new regular php file as far as I can tell.  I could be doing it  
wrong... but the files it created for me were empty.

I'm trying to figure out what you really get here that the (free) PDT  
doesn't do?  Obviously if you're using other Zend products -  
especially Zend Platform - this is well worth it.  But I kept  
encountering stuff that didn't fully work without Zend Platform (BIRT  
reports seem to need the Platform's java bridge and some of the  
debugging features need it too, for example).  PHPUnit and PHPDoc  
integration seems pretty cool... I wonder if those will make it into  
PDT at some point though.  Also, there seems to be extra refactoring  
tools and overall it seems more focused on PHP than PDT on its own.   
I see a server tunneling feature too which could be great for when a  
quick fix is needed but would be faster to do in a gui editor than in  
vim.

Hmm... I'm on the fence I guess... need to watch how this develops  
and figure out how much easier it will make my life than Eclipse with  
PDT/Web Tools/Subclipse before shelling out $254 (current 15% off  
price).

I would argue that you should use the term 'attribute' and not
fields. An relational attribute is generally accepted to be an ordered
tuple like [ 'first name', 'varchar 20' ].
Now one of the key concepts of the relational model is that
a table(relation) is an *unordered* collection of attributes --
that is there is no need for a given attribute to be
conceptually next to another.

Different 'relational' database management systems get this
right to different degrees.

But when it comes time to exchange data from one table in a

Valid XML documents must adhere to their DTD/Schema and to that
degree they have fields -- called 'elements'.
like
<customer>
   <first_name>Alfred</first_name>
   <last_name>Wilson</last_name>
   ...
</customer>

Of course you can get fancier and use 'XML attributes' like
<first_name nickname="Freddy">Alfred</first_name>

My point exactly (see above about) XML elements.

But in XML, elements do not have to be ordered because
each element can carry with it its own semantics.
That is to say, each element in XML can carry with it
the same meaning which is conveyed in a relational model
by a 'relational attribute'.
(Of course you can require elements to be ordered in
XML if you want to)

Thus XML frees you from the confines of having to carefully
order your data when you want to exchange it.

Now if during the exchange of XML data it has to
stop on a system and be stored, it certainly makes sense
to put it into an XML database.

Or perhaps you want to avoid hitting and re-hitting some
data store in order to exchange data. There again it
would be a good idea to select a large amount of
data and put it in an XML database and parcel it
out later.

Now I am not suggesting that the value of XML is
confined to solely to exchanging data (though it
might be possible to defend such a position) --
I'm just trying to describe the difference between
XML 'structuring' and relational 'structuring' -- and to
highlight (at least one case) when XML can be the
superior choice.

But I stick by what I said earlier that XML documents
(and hence XML Databases) are not inherently
less structured or more capable of handling unstructured
data than a relational data model.

What I mean is that it doesn't matter (unless you enforce it) whether
you call it:
<firstname></firstname>
or
<first_name></first_name>
or
<froo></froo>

What you put into the XML DB is irrelevant, unless you want it to be.
Of course, it has be valid XML, but, as you pointed out, the
flexibility allows you to carry the semantics along with the data.
That's the point I think a lot of the questions at the presentation
last Tuesday missed.

I've never run into this issue.  I've run into the "if you don't specify 
the order, the database will use it's own default ordering" - and a lot 
of depending on "select *" to give things in the "correct" order.

But one can hardly blame databases for having different defaults if you 
fail to specify one.

This statement prompted my reason for replying.  Is there a standalone 
set of tools for updating/editing an XML database?

I'm thinking of something along the lines of Microsoft Access, where you 
have 1 tool which has forms, program logic, and a database and all the 
data ends up "together" from a user standpoint.  So I can give someone a 
couple of access files and they have a complete application they can run 
locally?

(In case one is curious, my father was demonstrating a little MSAccess 
app he is putting together for tracking/monitoring environmental data. 
Something along the lines of the life cycle of animals in an 
environment, the number of particular animals seen, yadda yadda yadda.

I don't pretend to understand what it is he is doing, it's just his 
current crusade to organize his own data and give other people the 
ability to track the same data and share it with each other in an 
organized fashion.

He was motivated to do so after he discovered how useful having such 
data organized and handy is when disputing the environmental impact 
statements of company paid environmental surveyors doing a 1 day study)

Something non-Access based would be better, but since this basically is 
a tool for non-techies, it has to be simple and not dependent on a 
centralized server for the data to be housed.

I should also point out, ssh access is a major plus (if anyone still

Exactly -- ordering matters.
It is possible that you can always get lucky
and have the ordering match as it
*might* between say Sybase and SQL Server.
(their code base was the same a few years back)

But just because it doesn't blow up, doesn't
mean that ordering doesn't matter.

I blame DBMS's for a lot of things -- but not that.

I think the free edition of SQL Server (the express edition)
supports the Microsoft XML extensions.

What does "not too expensive" mean?  Is $150/mo too much?  or are you
looking for closer to $15?

What does "reliable" mean?  good support, or survives the front page
of digg/slashdot?

Just to clarify my earlier request (thanks for all the suggestions BTW, 
some look really really good).

I have a client that I need to move off my server onto a third-party 
server (mainly because Im too busy to deal with it). So Im looking for a 
package that allows at least 5 or more domains. (So maybe a reseller 
account would be good?)

How cheap? Well, anything under $30/month that allows several domains is 
just fine. (A little over is OK if it has more features - there's some 
wiggle room).

I need PHP5, MySQL (4.x or 5,x). I need to run Joomla, symfony and some 
static sites. Access via ssh would be nice but is not a deal-breaker (Im 
quite comfortable using a command-line but I can deal with a "control" 
panel if I must ;-). Need mailboxes for these domains too.


Cheers,

there's always dreamhost... though as I always say - check out their http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/ 
  page, where their downtime is listed. If you see the frequency of  
issues and can handle it then it might be worth it? I like their  
choice of PHP 4 or 5, fast_cgi support, ruby on rails... (yes I said  
it! haha)

I like Media Temple's gs service for $20 a month.  You get SSH,
unlimited domains, performance under load, and a clean control panel.
No root access.  Support is ticket/email based. No phone number to
call, but they are pretty responsive to email.

I'm just now leaving Dreamhost. If you're going the shared server
route, I highly advise against them. I've had nothing but bad
experiences with random slowdowns and whatnot. I guess it depends on
how important it is to you that your website is up.

(I'm moving to a different company but since the move isn't complete
and I've not been on the new server long enough to tell, I can't
recommend them yet with any authority.)

thats why every time I mention dreamhost I mention http://www.dreamhoststatus.com 
  ;) As for PHP related things I haven't had problems yet (been 2-3  
years now). Though it seems I'm a lucky one in that regard? Joomla and  
wordpress have been running on a few domains I host with no issues,  
also phpBB and gallery. I'm looking forward to seeing some other  
viable alternatives in this thread as well... always good to have some  
references for hosts...

1and1 is OK.  I wasn't too happy with Dreamhost.  I have been with 
Nomanix (http://www.nomanix.com/) for several years now, and am 
extremely satisfied with them.  Any time I have a question, I get a 
quick reply from David, usually within an hour.  I like dealing with the 
same person who knows me.  ssh, CPanel (including phpMyAdmin , PEAR 
configuration, ...), reseller accounts, SSL certificates, etc.  My site 
is running PHP 4.4.7, but I believe they offer php 5 as well.  Uptime is 
never a problem.  I can highly recommend them.

I've been with www.hostdime.com for a few years now and they're a little
pricey with their domain registrations, but their hosting is pretty cheap.
I'm not entirely sure about the number of domains, but I believe I pay 6
dollars a month for my plan hosting.

I also have a few accounts with dreamhost and I have noticed a bit of
downtime with them.

Check out 10for10.com - that's where my personal account is - "Host  
ten websites with 1GB disk space and 25GB data transfer for $10/month"

The numbers might seem low (disk space / bandwidth) - but they don't  
oversell at all so the QoS is very high.  All of our corporate stuff  
is done with the parent company Empowering Media and I know the owner  
quite well... so I can definitely vouch for them.

Currently though... the php5 on 10for10 accounts is done through  
fastcgi/suphp -- which has worked out fine for me.  It might require  
config changes on your end but that's about it.

I used www.1and1.com before but http://www.bluehost.com/ has better and
quicker 24/7 customer service. With bluehost.com you will have to fax a
photo ID over to them if you want SSH access. This isn't the case with
1and1.com . Also, with 1and1, you have to pay 3 months at a time. I don't
believe bluehost has this option yet. I bought the two year hosting plan up
front. I recommend bluehost.com.

Yeah very good point ... in fact it's probably a good idea to remain a  
little (or super) skeptical of really *any* shared hosting type of  
setup.  Your paranoia level around your app + business requirements  
usually dictates (or should) how you are going to initially setup.   
You do get what you pay for.  Cheap hosting == cheap security (opinion).

I would find it extremely hard to believe they would release an  
initial IDE w/ a broken template like that.  Either way I guess it's  
assumed that project structure is the recommend way of building your  
skeleton app ... @ least according to

http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.html#zend.controller.quickstart.go

It seems in line.  Everything else seems ok, only annoying thing is  
my .eclipse_keyring keeps popping up every time I start.  It should be  
possible to use one Eclipse for Java work and one for PHP / Web, does  
having J2EE / Neon / Aptana all conflict in someway?  I also keep  
getting the update dialog box telling me updates are available w/o  
anything to download ...
