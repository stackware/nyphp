Subject: [nycphp-talk] Seeking A Remote Developer Position
Message-ID: <CABActuATRgRriJAhojYkV2WH17+zjVwmKvs9d1ozAGmDp2U-Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have over 14 years of experience with PHP/MySQL and I am looking for a
position at a company which would allow for remote work.
If you know of any companies which work with remote employees please let me
know so that I can find out if they have any positions available.

I am currently employed full-time in Boston however I am looking to
relocate away from the city to western mass and there are no php developer
jobs in that area.

Any assistance would be appreciated, you can also see my resume on my site
in both PDF and Word formats

+1 for Stack Overflow Careers.

I don't have any direct experience with a placement from them but
http://www.CyberCoders.com/<http://www.CyberCoders.com/qb.aspx?posId=JRJ-SRFEeng-NY&ad=CSJason.Rodrigues>seems
to have tons of listings for remote work.

Also, www.artlogic.com/careers are almost exclusively staffed by contract,
remote developers.

Best of luck with the relocation.

Try adding this to the top of your code:

error_reporting(E_ALL);

That should show you more details.

Where is the code that generates your Send Message button?  I suspect 
that you have an absolute reference to a file that's where the reference 
says it is on your laptop but not on the server, so you're sending the 
user to some blank page, not back to this page.

If you were to run this somewhere where error reporting was turned on,  
you would immediately find out that you have a parse error in line 100.

Most of the times when someting like that happens, it is because the server
has display_errors OFF.

a simple test for that is to just generate and an obvious error (e.g. just
a line with aaa) and see if you get an error.

Also many setups doesn't allow you to change php setting on the fly but you
must use .htaccess, your own php.ini or some other way.

To test that try changing the error reporting level as you were adviced too
and then write phpinfo() to see if the setting is changed.

If you were to run this somewhere where error reporting was turned on, you would immediately find out that you have a parse error in line 100.

Also add ini_set('display_errors', 1); in the same place you put
error_reporting

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Domain Name Compression Tables
Message-ID: <11000867.13478813.20120927171917.50648a951fed00.03769050@mail18.us4.mandrillapp.com>

     Got an oddball question and since it tracks back to programming for
websites, figured this would be the place to ask: 

  I was wondering if anyone here knows of some standardized lookup tables
for Domain Name Compression. I'm storing a tuple of information to be used
to generate a TOTP token[TOTP key is stored/indexed by Domain Name and
Username it applies to]. Storage limit is, for practical purposes, 64
bytes. 

  If I SHA-1 the data, it comes out nicely at 20 bytes each, which leaves
me 4 bytes to play with. 

  So I've added a format byte for each bit of data...and will think of
something to use that last byte for[probably a rough running counter of the
number of times the data has been accessed/used] 

  For formatting, I'm currently using: x01: SHA-1 x02: Raw Ascii, left
justified x03: Packed Ascii, left justified x04: raw UTF8 x05: reserved to
for some way of packing UTF8 

  With the above format, it means that when possible the data can be stored
in a format where it can be retrieved and reviewed...but if the data is too
long then it sha-1 is the backup so the data can still be USED even if it
can't be queried. 

  Now, I'd like to expand the ability to maintain data in a useful format.
For domains, for example, there are only 316 top level domains at the
moment: http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=c9a52257db59455f9b94984fbad0f83b&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.iana.org%2FTLD%2Ftlds-alpha-by-domain.txt&url_id=765925821&tags=252069,1108865 so some pseodo
code in PHP to handle it could be: 

 $myTLD='com'; if in_array($myTLD, $domains) {
$tldIndex=array_search($myTLD, $domains); // 55 if using the IANA file as
of today // a tld label which is 16 bits long, starting with 1 always uses
table lookup $tldLabel=0xb1000000000000000; // convert the index to a
binary number, as the index does not go above 512 this is limited to at
most 10 bits $tldIndexB=decbin($tldIndex); $tldLabel= $tldLabel| $tldIndexB
} else { // assuming ASCII TLD's here, highest binary value is lowercase z,
decimal 122 // binary 01111010 - ie first bit is ALWAYS 0 $tldLabel =
pack("c*", $myTLD);} }  Note: I'm not actually going through the pain of
decoding/encoding this on the PHP side...it just helps me to think to plot
out the function in PHP and then translate it Javascript and C.  So using
DNS Name Notation
<%0Ahttp://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_DNSNameNotationandMessageCompressionTechnique-3.htm>
for compression this leads to being able to at encode some longer domains
in a manner which can be reversed for user display. 

  It strikes me that this should be a process done frequently enough that
there is a standard lookup table for common domain label entrees so that
all applications can share it. 

  I realize that the dictionary can be included in with the data, but for
this purpose it doesn't make a lot of since. I can only store and update 3
64 byte chunks, wheras I have available 2k of program space on the chip
<http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/msp430g2231.pdf>...which should give me
over 1k of space for static lookup storage since the TOTP calculation
function isn't too memory intensive. 

  For the curious, I'm implementing a very simply TOTP keytool on a
Launchpad. Chrome has a nice experimental feature to access the com port on
the computer - so it's child's play to take the existing code snippets and
create a PHP plugin to allow TOTP logons and a supporting Chrome extension
to do auto-detection and entering of the stored passwords. 

  Plus it's a lot of fun figuring out how to merge my love of Website
Engineering with my love of electronics. I'm currently working on a
Javascript and PHP library to fiddle with the IOIO
<https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10585> which is a hell of lot harder
because there I have to figure out his existing protocol and actually
convert the commands into packed byte arrays inside Javascript and PHP. So
far I did some coding at last weeks JoomlaDay and I was only able to get
some one off's done in order to access the thing remotely and toggle the
LED <https://github.com/garyamort/ioioWebsockets/tree/master/oneoffs>.  
For the curious, my actually line count of written code is rather low since
pySerial and pyWebsockets already had most of what I needed.   Now I need
to generate some Javascript and PHP classes to actually use as a library
and use the protocol.  

  Thanks for your time. -Gary
