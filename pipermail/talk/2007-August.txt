As someone who has been on both sides on the fence, a few helpful
comments based on my experience:
(I'm brainstorming here, so this is in no particular order)

- It's totally acceptable to try to get a better understanding of a
candidates "true" technical capabilities during an interview. Of
course you need to let them know in advance that you'll be asking
technical stuff.

 - A written test is *not* the best way to gauge a person's knowledge.
What works best for me is a conversation between myself and the
candidate.
This is for a couple of reasons -
(1) Many people just aren't good at written tests regardless of their
knowledge (it makes them nervous, etc).
(2) Ultimately, you shouldn't really care about a person's specific
knowledge at a specific point in time (ie the interview) You should
care about their ability to make the right decision at the right time,
and in timely fashion.
For me, this means that if the candidate doesn't know something, they
at least know enough to fully understand the question and it's
implications, and know where to find the correct answer quickly (and
understand the answer as well).

- I usually ask the candidate to describe a project they were recently
involved with and then interweave my questions into the conversation.
I'll ask why certain decisions were made and what other options they
were considering.

- It's also very revealing to see what questions the interviewer asks back.
I'll ask something purposely vague (like "you're told to build a new
web app - what language would u use?")

Hope that helps.

Ophir,
I greatly agree with your statement regarding the un-usefulness of written
technical exams.  A recruiter asked me to complete an online one recently, I
felt lost and disoriented.  Even though that being a developer for almost 3
years using PHP, I have never come ac crossed a problem that I
couldn't FINDan answer for.  But on this exam, I couldn't answer at
least half of the
questions.

Ophir:

I think your method is excellent, more hr people should practice it.

The only problem is that the interviewer has to know what they are 
talking about, in many of the interviews I have taken, that's sadly 
not true.

Cheers,

tedd

Hi!

The current edition of Computerworld has an article about interesting 
questions asked during interviews. Indeed, the managers came up with 
quite some interesting ones and they explain why they ask them.

Message-ID: <78c525cd0708050621i4c016a3bk2367085f23cdc056@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Friends,

I have installed Windows 2003 sever and then installed PHP 4.3.4 on it.
I have a problem that file is not uploading to the specified directory on
the server ( locally windows 2003 ). I am using the file upload code in php
like :

<? if ($_FILES['filefield']['name'] != ""){

@copy($_FILES['filefield']['tmp_name'],"../dir1/".$_FILES['filefield'
]['name']);

}
?>


The settings in the php.ini files are correct.

Can anyone guide me what should be the problem, so that the files are not
uploading to the server.

Looking forward to here from you soon.
Thanks
Wdw.

Do you have the correct permissions setup for the directory you are
uploading to?

Hi,
Try to strip off the `@' before the `copy' function and see the error
that PHP raises. If your php.ini configuration does not allow you to
see PHP warnings or errors, make sure the PHP errors are logged into
the Apache's error_log (or whatever) file and take a look at that.

You might check out:
http://us.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php

It looks like their directory is an absolute path.  I don't know how
that might work in a chrooted environment, but I don't think your
'../dir1' makes sense if it is expecting an absolute path.  The copy
doc doesn't state explicitly.  But, it's probably better to use the
uploaded file functions -- copy doesn't save you anything as the temp
file ought to be automatically deleted at the end of the script
anyway.

Here's my suggestion:

<?php

if ( isset( $FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'] ) && is_uploaded_file(
$FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'] ) ) {
    move_uploaded_file( $FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $dir .
$FILES['userfile']['name'] );
}

?>

Good luck,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Many pages: one script
Message-ID: <46B60C11.2090904@metalab.unc.edu>

I'm considering a simple site that I may design in PHP. PHP is probably 
the simplest solution except for one thing: it carries a very strong 
coupling between pages and scripts. As far as I've ever been able to 
tell PHP really, really, really wants there to be a single primary .php 
file for each URL that does not contain a query string (though that file 
may of course invoke others).

For the system I'm designing that simply won't work. In Java servlet 
environments it's relatively trivial to map one servlet to an entire 
directory structure, so that it handles all requests for all pages 
within that hierarchy.

Is there any *reasonable* way to do this in PHP? The only way I've ever 
seen is what WordPress does: use mod_rewrite to redirect all requests 
within the hierarchy to a custom dispatcher script that converts actual 
hierarchy components into query string variables. I am impressed by this 
hack, but it's way too kludgy for me to be comfortable with. For one 
thing, I don't want to depend on mod_rewrite if I don't have to.

Surely by now there's a better way? How do I overcome the one file per 
URL assumption that PHP makes?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PDO and Prepared Statements in MySQL when using LIKE

Message-ID: <46B60D6F.7040209@gmail.com>

hey!

I have some query with a LIKE expression e.g. "SELECT * FROM table WHERE 
column LIKE "$phpvar%", but I would like to use prepared statements 
instead of writing the variable directly into the query. So I write:

$sth = $this->conn->prepare ("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE 
\":phpvar%\"");
$sth->bindParam (":phpvar", $phpvar);
$sth->execute();
var_dump ($sth->fetchAll());

Here I get an empty result set when using prepared statements. However 
when just using string concatenation and putting the variable directly 
into the query it works fine.

Is this expected or a bug?

Cheers,
Jakob

hmmmm, I have never found this to be a problem.  Using includes, you
can pull in .php code from anywhere, even pages with a .php extension
may be 99.99% html, with a  just a single include('foo.php') in it.
Keeps things super streamlined, and your pages are very readable.

You've got it backwards. I want one script to service many URLs, not 
many scripts to service one URL.

You have to think of the whole file-serving hierarchy here.  Apache gets a 
request for an URL.  What will Apache do with it?  Apache will find a file 
somewhere that matches that URL, and then Apache will either send that file 
off for further processing (if the file is registered as such within 
Apache) or Apache will just send that file off to the browser as-is.  PHP 
doesn't even enter into the picture until the decision you're talking about 
has already been made by Apache.

I don't know much about java servlets, but I strongly suspect it's the 
same - the Sun web server or whatever you're using is making that decision.  
It may appear to be "simpler" than the PHP/Apache combination but it really 
isn't.  Perhaps it is better integrated because both the web server and the 
programming language are products of one company, but it's not any simpler 
when it executes.

In any case the correct answer is just to tell Apache to serve file X for 
every URL that looks like Y or Z or W.  Mod_rewrite.  That's what it's 
there for, and it does its job well, and it can be as simple as a couple 
lines in an .htaccess file.

No doubt one could partly handle this with PHP files:

foo.com/index.php - lots of code
foo.com/dir1/index.php - PHP file sends everything to foo.com/index.php
foo.com/dir2/index.php - PHP file sends everything to foo.com/index.php
foo.com/dir1/dir3/index.php - PHP file sends everything to foo.com/index.php

but telling Apache to use foo.com/index.php for all requests is simpler and 
less error-prone.  It can be quite simple:

Contents of foo.com/yourdir/.htaccess file:
-------------------------------------------------------
RewriteEngine On
RewriteOptions inherit

RewriteBase /yourdir

RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)/([0-9A-Za-z]+)/ index.php?var1=$1&var2=$2
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)/([0-9A-Za-z]+) index.php?var1=$1&var2=$2
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)/ index.php?var1=$1
--------------------------------------------------------

Now, any request for foo.com/yourdir/anything/anythingatall will be sent to 
foo.com/yourdir/index.php, which will see the extra "directories" as URL 
variables.  The user will not know what's happening - they'll continue to 
see the "directories" in their browser status bar.

Here's an example of how to do it without using mod_rewrite. The  
basic idea is to build a front-controller that parses the $_SERVER 
['PATH_INFO'] variable, and delegates the request appropriately for  
your application.

http://www.zend.com/zend/trick/tricks-apr-2003-urls.php

* gotcha: I've had problems getting this to work when php is  
installed as a CGI.

I agree, I'm not fond of the mod_rewrite solution. However, I've  
found that to be the only reliable method when php is running as a CGI.

We actually do this at my work.  I don't have the details to hand, but 
it basically involves setting the apache document root to be your actual 
script, ie. index.php.  That way no matter what url you request you will 
always hit that page.

The script then examines the url that was requested to determine exactly 
what page it should be rendered.

Sorry to not have details - but it is possible.

PHP doesn't actually care, but...

It has to do with the way PHP reaches into the request processing stack in
Apache (assuming Apache).  Basically PHP doesn't reach as far up the request
stack as other things do, like mod_perl, Java, etc, which of course could be
argued as a good or bad thing.

A lot of people use mod_rewrite, but I never was a big fan either.  However,
you can implement this "fuse-box" style processing quite elegantly in pure
Apache.  There are a number of ways, most of which are covered in these
results:

http://www.google.com/search?q=mediawiki+url+rewrite

There are other options as well, including the ErrorDocument hack and
playing with ForceType, but I'm not much of a fan of those either.  I find
the following to be the most elegant:

    Alias /support/ "/var/www/www.something.com/support/"
    Alias /Test/ "/var/www/www.something.com/Test/"
    AliasMatch /(.*) "/var/www/www.something.com/index.php"

/support becomes a nice place to throw static stuff, like images, CSS, etc.

/Test can be used as a test bed, to test PHP scripts outside of the
fuse-box.

And then index.php is where the action is, getting called on every request.
Of course, the above can be adjusted as needed to have an unlimited number
of fuse-boxes at different URLs, etc.  Combined with things like Apache's
AddType, the possibilities are endless.  I think you can even use AddType
for a directory (or maybe it's ForceType).

I actually leave index.php empty, and use auto_prepend_file to call a PHP
file that handles the heavy lifting.  This typically allows for better
delegation of responsbility and keeping PHP code outside of the
DocumentRoot.

And all of the above can be combined with various combinations of
<Directory> and <Location> directives in Apache, making it really flexible
and dizzying.

But, I generally keep it simple and use something like the above, and then
have a request processor in PHP do the URL mapping in a style akin to the
Java world.  Straightforward, none of the PATH_INFO confusions, and
setup-and-forget.

Hi,

Every once in a while I run into this and it takes a few hours to

required to wriggle out of it:

Notice: [...] The script tried to execute a method or access a
property of an incomplete object. Please ensure that the class
definition "Foo" of the object you are trying to operate on was loaded
_before_ unserialize() gets called or provide a __autoload() function
to load the class definition in [...]

Can someone explain to me what I need to know about how class
definitions are loaded so that I can make some sense of these errors?

It's not simply a matter of including the necessary file in the right
spot. Clearly there are other forces at work and I'd like to know what
they are.

Not everyone cares about search engines indexing unique URLs, but if you 
do, you have to consider how the server response codes are generated for 
various URLs. Aliasing content under different URLs is akin to asking 
the search engines not to index it properly, and/or not to rank it 
highly for relevant searches.

If you are using Apache, Micahel Sims has it correct. Apache is making 
the decisions about URL dispatching, and since mod_rewrite is Apache's 
extension for mapping URLs to dispatch, then that's the logical tool for 
the job. As far as search engines go, you always need to be aware of 
(and work around) how the default dispatching is handled (trailing 
slashes, file not found, etc).

If you want cross-platform (server) scripts written in PHP, I'm not sure 
you can ever break free of the web server completely and still stay in 
complaince with search engine indexing best practices. Of course once 
you are at that level of analysis, I think some of the PHP gurus can 
highlight other problems you'll encounter that are more difficult than 
how to properly manage the URL dispatch.

I think the Zend Framework is one case where they really really really 
would like to avoid needing apache mod rewrite. As it has evolved, they 
have added several rewrite routers to manage the same infrastructure 
issues that mod-rwrite is typically used for. The best and only one I 
like (for SEO purposes) is a full blown regex rewrite router, certainly 
no "simpler" than mod rewrite.

And that is exactly how Edward described it. You include the one script 
into the many URLs you want to make use of the script.
I guess that isn't what you are after, it just reads that way.

The other posts indicate to use a gateway script, something that I 
thought about using at some point as well. My home server can be 
accessed through different URLs and although it is the same server I 
want a php script to pick up the request and redirect to the designated 
location. This way my wife can do whatever she wants on her portion and 
I can do whatever I want on my portion. Since we don't have time to even 
start with a decent web site this is a moot point.

Coming back to what you want to accomplish, maybe defining exactly what 
you need and giving some examples may be helpful in reducing confusion.

I've never seen that error message before, but I think I understand  
what it is saying. It sounds like you are employing a technique that  
is generally frowned upon because of it's dependencies and  
complexity. Did you inherit this code from someone else?
Since it's complaining about objects loading before unserialize, I'm  
guessing you are passing serialized objects either through a session  
or directly through to other objects. An object is an instance of a  
class, you need to load the base class definition in order to create  
an instance of that class. What you are doing is passing an instance  
of a class without having the class loaded. The only way I know of  
doing this is by passing a serialized instance through a session.  
When it is unserialized, it doesn't have the base class available to  
restore the class object.
So, you must load (include) the class file before you try to  
unserialize the instance of the class. Alternatively, you can create  
an __autoload function that will determine what file needs to be  
loaded in order to create an instance of the class to be created.  
This can generally be done by mapping the class name be called to the  
file that needs to be loaded. __autoload is generally used for  
dynamically loading classes so you don't load anything that you don't  
need.

You may connect to the database 90% of the time, but why load the  
database class before you need to, since you may not need to.

Hope that helps

And there's the potential problem.  The people doing the tech hiring may 
not be technical enough to maintain a meaningful discussion about the 
finer points of OOP and stored procedures.  Of course, they could pull 
an overworked senior developer off the line and into the conference room 
to tech the candidate.  But my experience here is that too many bit 
jockeys lack the personal skills to interview an applicant.

Anecdote: at a former job (an agency) the CTO was confounded about why 
promising applicants would make it all the way through the process only 
to turn the job offer down.  The package and working conditions were, 
after all, competitive.  She brought me in to handle the tech management 
side of her job.  For my first gig, she wanted me to sit in on the 
engineering interviews happening that morning.  She always left this to 
the most senior developer in the company, who had been there Forever.

He started by asking a couple of standard "how would you do this" 
questions.  Then he suddenly got obnoxious and defensive in a sort of 
Comic Book Guy way.  After watching several of these interviews over the 
next few days I saw a common MO.  The techie was paranoid about losing 
his stature as top dog.  The better the applicant the more contentious 
the interview became, even to the point where he'd ask the applicant 
arcane Java architecture questions when the job was for a Perl 
developer.  No wonder the company was only finding junior developers 
willing to work there.

Job interviews are information sharing events.  The applicant is selling 
himself to you but you're also selling the company to him.  In a 
seller's market like this, the better the applicant, the more the onus 
falls on the interviewer to make the candidate want to work there. 
After all, a really good developer usually knows he's really good and 
s/he probably won't have much patience with an interviewing process that 
feels like a grilling by homicide detectives.

Relevant to nothing, I used to work for a company founded by the former 
head of HR at Cisco.  One of his favorite interview ice-breaker 
questions was, "do you like dogs?"

Hi Brent,

Well I figured out what the problem was. I was putting an 'Auth'
object in the session. I made  some changes to something that
invalidated the class definition of that object. As soon as I logged
out the Auth object in the session was reinstantiated and the error
went away. No big deal.

Thanks,
Mike

Actually I've pinpointed the problem a little more. It seems you must
require_once the class of the object stored in the session before
calling session_start. I guess session_start is deserializing things
and if the class definition isn't available it defaults to an
incomplete type.

Hi there,

you can try for $$phpvar in the query. It might work.
e.g

$sth = $this->conn->prepare ("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Oracle PHP Install Issue

     
  Hi Everyone,
I am working on Windows 2000 test and production boxes.  The production was very out of date, so I began building the test box up.  On the test box I have Instant Client, Apache 2.0.39, and PHP 5.2.2.  It works fine.  On the production I just attempted to update it to the same.  It had on it, Oracle Client 9 and Webserv 1.1.3 (it is a package that has Apache, MySql, and PHP).  I removed both Oracle Client 9 and Webserv.  I installed Apache, PHP, and Instant Client.  I could not connect to the database.  I used the same tnsnames, the same httpdconf, the same php.ini from the test.  I had the msvcr71.dll and oci8.dll in sys32.  Couldn't connect.  In frustration, and that its a production box, I tried to rollback to client 9.  Then I got a PHP error, unable to load php_oci8.dll.  I did not get this error when instant client is called.  I can use a db utility and connect to the Oracle Database. 

Facts:  

Both boxes have Windows 2000.
Production is real server hardware, test is a desktop.
Database to connect to is Oracle 9i.
Test box was a fresh install of OS, production was not.
Production was running PHP 4, upgraded to PHP 5. 

If anyone would be able to provide assistance, it would be extremely appreciated.

I just need pointing in the right direction. Does anybody know where I 
should be looking for in information on secure login/logon (using PHP 5 and 
DOES NOT USE COOKIES) with coding examples?

Here is what I am trying to accomplish. I have a website where anybody may 
enter, except certain restricted areas where access codes are required.

I suppose the nearest "real life" example would be a shopping mall where 
customers are able to shop ect.; But are not allowed into restricted areas 
without valid access codes which must be verified before before access is 
granted, for example the shopping mall management area.

My apologies up front for the example; But this is precisely what I want to 
do, except on the web.

I think there is a distinction to make here, however.

There are two parts to the URL
routing/handling/SEO-friendly-URL-of-the-month/etc game:

1: getting the web server to relax it's by-default strict mapping of the URL
space to the filesystem, and then passing whatever the request was down to
the processing language

2: programming mechanisms in the processing language to intelligently deal
with whatever URL it gets from the web server

In PHP at least, these are two different things.  At some point there was
interest in apache_hooks, but it unfortunately never matured.

In other technologies, #1 equates more to the processing language reaching
up and grabbing what it needs from the server, and then taking over.  In
PHP, however, it's certainly a "top-down" approach.

For #1, most frameworks, and the two mentioned above, prefer the use
mod_rewrite.  Then they each have their own mechanism to handle #2, with
some arguably being worse than others.

There's also fundamental differences in the way #1 can be handled.
Rewriting is a very different thing than aliasing a handler or set of URLs
to a single URL or processor.

The later is more elegant - and more flexible - avoiding mucking with obtuse
rewrite conditions and rules that require a testing cycle and often depend
on a fixed set of extensions to ignore.

When you say "secure login", do you mean changing over to https? Do you 
want to use a database?
Typically, you would keep track of user's logins in a session, but that 
means using a cookie. One way that I thought of without using a database 
and cookies is checking on page access against the password file of 
Apache, which on top forces a user name / password entry on the first 
access. There may be a way to get the valid user state from Apache 
through $_SERVER, but I don't know. In any case, you would need to reset 
the logged in state for a user as soon as they leave the page (means as 
soon as your php/html is finsihed), same as entering the secure mall 
area and leaving it.
That is far away from ideal as I can think instantly of a whole bunch of 
scenarios where this falls apart, but it would be as safe or unsafe as 
electronic access control in a mall building. In that case, as soon as 
you leave the secured area and want to enter again, you have to use the 
credentials again. A finished page is to be considered leaving the 
secured area. Otherwise it will be like propping the door open. In 
regards to the web app, if cou do not amndate reauthentication on each 
page load one can login once and then leave the web browser open for 
everyone else to use. Using a timer comes to mind that after finishing 
redirects to a unsecure page or at least requires reauthentication (this 
  is like the security guard who asks for your credentials and in case 
you don't have them kicks you out), but I have no idea how timers behave 
in connection to any links or forms on the page.

Hmmm, no real answer, but maybe I just put enough crazy ideas on the 
table that allow you to steer into the right direction. Is this for some 
demo? Would be kewl if you get one of these cheap keyboard wedges that 
translate magcard swipes into typed characters. Then you can mimic a 
real access control system with card swipe plus PIN.

If you need any further details on the "real" access control part let me 
know, I worked in the industry for almost seven years.

This may be implied by examples, but it is simply not true.  PHP, like 
any other generalized language, allows you to easily create any kind of 
structure for your code that you want and map it URLs and databases web 
services any way you want.

A common pattern is called the "universal dispatcher", where one file, 
typically index.php, accepts all queries and parses the request 
parameters and dispatches the request to some other program.

Not true.  I think that if you go this impression, the rest of your 
questions may not be valid, as they may take this false assumption as 
true.  What do you think?

I don't think I can parse this statement without knowing what is in 
those "pages", why there is a servlet handling them, and what kind of 
content they are, media? interactive database table maintenance?

>

Again, I'm not clear on what you are trying to serve.  We probably have 
to back up to the beginning and erase the assumption that PHP has a 
one-to-one correspondence between a URL (or page) and a PHP file.  
Having erased that, we have to ask what kind of content you are trying 
to serve, then we have to look at PHP examples.

Then it would probably make sense to talk about whether to use 
mod_rewrite, talk about how PHP do its own kind of mod_rewrite, how to 
build libraries in PHP and so forth.

The hardest part is not to relate it to what you already know, such as 
Java.  That will really slow you down.

I was recently playing around with the memcache extension to see what  
happens if you get something that hasn't been defined and got this  
error (using php 4.4.6)"

  "The script tried to execute a method or access a property of an  
incomplete object. Please ensure that the class definition user of  
the object you are trying to operate on was loaded _before_ the  
session was started in [filename] on [line number]"

So that version of the error probably would have helped you more.  In  
5.2.3, I don't get any error, but when I print_r on the object, it  
shows this type:  __PHP_Incomplete_Class Object

I wonder why the major php frameworks don't mention this as an  
option?  It seems from the documentation that it can't go  
in .htaccess - so that may be why.  The frameworks are assuming most  
of their users are on shared servers and can't modify their httpd  
config.

If there was an existing file... say favicon.ico... would AliasMatch  
know to just serve that up instead of sending through index.php?   
That's one thing I like about the following mod_rewrite rule - if the  
file or directory exists, it won't pass it to the index.php front  
controller:
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1

I've tried at least four different ways around this over the years,
and I use mod_rewrite for everything but trivial apps.

Here are the ways I'm aware of:

1) Use ErrorDocument directive to pass 404s to a php script
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#errordocument

2) Use Action and AddHandler directives
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_actions.html#action

3) Use Multiviews option so that
/index.php/path/to/some/virtual/resource resolves to index.php
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/content-negotiation.html#multiviews

4) Use mod_rewrite to send all requests to the same script

The only one I _wouldn't ever_ try again is the ErrorDocument method,
because the $_SERVER environment that you end up with (and which is
crucial to determining what was actually requested) is not what you'd
expect.

Mutliviews is always tricky for me, for some reason. I have a hard
time getting it to work with my base server config. Also, I don't like
to have the script name in every request.

Rewrite has proven to be the most flexible and (long-term) easiest
solution for me. But the Action/Handler method doesn't require any
extra extensions. I see it used by other projects, notably Trac.

Perhaps you are confused re: cookies. Session cookies (not stored
cookies!) are considered the best (most secure) way to handle
authentication from request to request. See PHP's session functions
for details and examples.

You should use HTTPS for login and for all subsequent requests to
avoid transmitting the session id in plaintext.

Download is the responsibility of the client. This isn't in PHP's domain.

Well, if you're passing the file through a script, it helps to tell  
the client some things by setting proper headers.  Content-type,  
Content-disposition and Content-length, for starters.

What you are proposing is not one script to service N URLs. It is N+1 
scripts to service N URLs. It is still necessary to create N separate 
loader scripts and place them at the right locations. That doesn't 
scale, and it's an extraordinary waste of resources when a small 
percentage of the possible URLs will ever be reached.

The goal here is to avoid having to manually create and maintain 
separate files for each URL. One file: many URLs. That's the goal.

Imagine, for example, a site with a separate URL structure for each 
user, or a separate URL for each date in history.

The point about this being an Apache problem rather than a PHP problem 
is understood, except that Java/Tomcat/mod_jk does seem able to 
accomplish what I'm looking for, so the real lack may not be in Apache 
but in now PHP connects to Apache.

Overall, though, I suspect all parties (Apache, PHP, Tomcat, Rails. 
etc.) are still too mired in circa-1994 models of web servers serving 
file systems. For example, once you map /foo to a servlet you can't then 
map /foo/bar to something else.

I'm curious if they're any web servers out there that do not start with 
the assumption that each URL maps to a file somewhere. What if a web 
server were designed to allow all URLs to be delegated to specific 
handlers? A file system handler need be only special case, no different 
from a database handler or a PHP handler.

RESTful API *design* is fairly easy to do. RESTful API *implementation* 
is fairly hard because no servers I've seen provide sufficient 
flexibility. Coming up on the Web's 20th anniversary, we still haven't 
learned how to take HTTP on its own terms rather than by pretending its 
something else we're more familiar with. Revolutions take time. :-)

I follow you, Hans, but then what about URLs as resource locators? Your 
elegant "aliasing a handler or set of URLs to a single URL or processor" 
means URLs don't equate to (unique) information resources. Doesn't that 
"break" the web?

Here's a simple example: a news site backed by a database. URLs like

http://www.example.com/news/2007/07/05
http://www.example.com/news/2007/07/06
http://www.example.com/news/2007/07/07
http://www.example.com/news/2007/07/08
...

return pages which contain that day's headlines extracted from the 
database.

One script, no more, must handle all dates. (I don't really care if 
there are 2 or 3 scripts, but I do not want to have to write a separate 
page for each URL. The number of PHP scripts must be finite and fixed. 
It should not increase with the number of URLs the script services.)

The only way I've ever seen this done in PHP is by using mod_rewrite, 
though they're a couple of other interesting suggestions in the thread I 
need to explore further. Do you have a suggestion?

I sincerely apologize for helping out. I am convinced that my proposal 
would be a suitable solution (you need one script, not more), but 
apparently confusion and misunderstanding takes precedence. If I could 
I'd eradicate my posts to save you from the disgust that I must have 
generated. In any case, I am deeply sorry to have caused you discomfort.

> Overall, though, I suspect all parties (Apache, PHP, Tomcat, Rails. etc.) are still too mired in circa-1994 models of web servers serving file systems. For example, once you map /foo to a servlet you can't then map /foo/bar to something else.

Well, then use IIS and ASP if that is a better solution. As you pointed 
out, these are "circa-1994" models that apparently work very well in 
2007. So much so that almost 2/3 of all internet sites use exactly this 
technology. Those folks must all be idiots for using something that so 
obviously doesn't work! There isn't much technology around that was 
created in the 90s and that still works well for today's needs. I don't 
see the big deal if a web server mirrors a file system structure, the 
problem is on how to get to the desired file - which can be done with an 
arbiter script that gets hit on each access and then redirects to the 
desired location.
Since the server just has to know what to serve up it will be quite easy 
to structure the site based on unique IDs and use a database table to 
retrieve the corresponding paths.
Calling mysite.gov/1234 directs to mysite.gov/foo/bar/index.php and
calling mysite.gov/4321 directs to mysite.gov/bar/foo/index.php. Of 
course, you need to add that information to a table or a simple ini file 
if no db is available. With a table you got one db connection, one 
select query, a few lines error output in case the resource doesn't 
exist, and one line for the redirect. Similar approach when using some 
authentication. And for the case that each resource is supposed to use 
the same code, instrument each resource with an include. I'd use two 
independent script files for that, but I guess one could smush that into 
one file as well. And with include I mean using the PHP code word 
"include()", not copying the code into each resource. And even that 
could be automated. I have written self-replicating scripts that worked 
out OK unless I wanted to make changes.

I apologize upfront if my comments yet again generated an intellectual 
distaste. In that case, I give up and you are on your own.

Have a nice day,

David

Are those dates consecutive? Means, is there a newspage for each day? If 
yes, then this is trivial. Still trivial if they are excluding sundays 
or such.

Yes, a db table and header("Location:  ") redirects that get stuffed 
from what the table query returns, plus one redirect for the case the 
required resource isn't found.

Unless I am entirely dense, this is what the other posts point to the 
whole time.

Typical MVC front controller. A "news" script like /news/index.php gets 
passed 2007 07 and 05 as params via the front controller, so one script 
handles all news/year/month/day URLs. Most frameworks provide an MVC 
front controller.

For me (a search engine optimizer) the core questions come later... how 
does that MVC front controller handle "exceptions" like:

/news/2007 (missing params) -> should 301 to default URL like 
/news/2007/01/01/ or throw a 404
/news/dfsrdf/07/06 (invalid year) -> 404 error
/news/ -> either 301 to default URL like /news/2007/01/01/ or throw a 404
/news -> 301 redirect to /news/ ? Too much redirection... either 301 to 
default URL like /news/2007/01/01/ or throw a 404
/news/2007/07/07 (no trailing slash) -> 301 to trailing slash version 
/news/2007/07/07/
/news/2007/06/07/whatever (excess params) -> 404

Admittedly, not many PHP coders care about such things. Some actually 
think flexible dispatching is a feature! Imagine that! ;-)

The way I actually did it in Andromeda was to use an .htaccess (though 
you could put in Apache's config of course) with these lines given to me 
by somebody on this list:

<FilesMatch "^news$">
 ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>


Now a file named "news" (a php file w/o the extension) is your universal 
dispatcher.  The "news" file splits the query string on slash and 
determines which row to pull from the database.

The "news" file can also make sure subscribers are paid up, stuff like 
that.  In fact, it can load your entire framework and do anything you want.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Repeating events script
Message-ID: <C2DD3975.6970%cliff@pinestream.com>

I need a script for repeating events. I need the ability to add repeating
events to a database and to retrieve repeating events for a specific day --
that?s it. No fancy day/week/month views. No multi-user groups. No  alarms,
approval cycles, etc. Just add/edit event & list event for a specific day.

Does anyone have suggestions? Perhaps there?s some fancy sql that can pull
repeating events from a db in one swoop. The closest I?ve scene is
webcalendar and Horde Kronolith. But both will take a bit of work to cut
down to my requirements. Using one of these as a ?front-end? to add events
might be ok. But it would be nice to have a lightweight script for
retrieving events to pull into my app.

Thanks in advance.
Cliff

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Friendly URLS...  The easy way!
Message-ID: <46B7C886.8080508@devonianfarm.com>

There's an easy way to get 'friendly' URLs in PHP.  There are two tricks 
involved:

(1) It seems to be a bit obscure that if you have a PHP script at

http://somewhere.com/myscript.php

the same script is called if you visit

http://somewhere.com/myscript.php/some/subdirectories.gif
http://somewhere.com/myscript.php/article/2007/07/07/hello-world

Try it!  You can make your script display something different based on 
the path
you enter by checking the superglobal $_SERVER["PATH_INFO"].  From simple
if-then-else ladders to advanced frameworks,  you can take it from there 
as you wish.

(2) You can remove the ".php" from your scripts by putting the following 
in your
.htaccess or apache configuration:

DefaultType application/x-httpd-php

Now if you have a script without an extension (say,  "myscript") you can 
write

http://somewhere.com/myscript/some/subdirectories.gif
http://somewhere.com/myscript/article/2007/07/07/hello-world

Unless you have a separate virtual resource that shows an archive of  
news for 2007 and not the january 1 entries, right?

> /news/2007/07/07 (no trailing slash) -> 301 to trailing slash

John, how important is this?  I think a former discussion on the list  
mentioned that most search engines are ok with the trailing slash vs.  
no trailing slash going to the same resource.

Thanks a lot,
Rob

You would still need an end time of course but this is doable if you  
adjust the 2nd param to strtotime (ie every Wednesday, etc)

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php

What you really do is iterate over the call w/ your db and of course  
this is better to do w/ a transaction or stored proc (if you have  
MySQL 5+) and do some type of caching if its a public query.  I would  
have thought this would be possible w/ PEAR Calendar but it is not.

Bare minimum w/ CakePHP (4 files/scripts: model, controller, view,  
route) + provided you have a db with a table called "articles":

1) /models/article.php
public class Article extends AppModel {}

2) /controllers/news_controller.php
public class NewsController extends AppController {
   function index($year, $month, $day) {
     $created = $year . "-" . $month . "-" . $day;
     $this->set('articles', $this->Article->findAllByCreated($date);
   }
}

3) /config/routes.php
$Route->connect ('/news', array('controller'=>'News',  
'action'=>'index'));

4) /app/views/news/index.php
<?php foreach($articles as $article): ?>
<?= $article['Article']['title'] ?>
<?php endforeach; ?>

mod_rewrite will push everything to index.php which will call a  
"Dispatcher" to handle the URL + follow what has been declared in the  
routes file.  I believe this would be almost the exact mechanism  
found in items like DispatchServlet in Spring, etc.  (although I  
think you can abstract more items).

	discussion)
Message-ID: <78c6bd860708061846t20773276y51af14d499ba804@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

It so happens I'm working on a CMS component and the 'Many pages one
script' discussion has inspired me to add mod_rewrite capability. I
have a catch-all RewriteRule that just sends everything through
index.php at the top of which I have a "handler table" that maps the
REQUEST_URI to a handler class. I'm using preg_match to do the match
and collect the parameters.

So an example regex looks like:

  '@/news/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)@'

This works fine with REQUEST_URIs like:

  /news/2007/10/31

but it does not match any of the following:

  /news/2007/10
  /news/2007
  /news

I would like to match these. For example, if the day parameter is not
provided the match array returned by preg_match should simply have one
fewer elements.

So how does one designate parts of a preg_match expression as optional?

Mike

If you are consistent on your site, so you always use trailing slash or 
not, Google says it will handle things properly.

But what if you have great indexing on /news/, and people linking to you 
on /news/, but /news returns the same content? Now what if I link to 
/news from a high power web site. Will Google decide to "value" the 
/news over the /news/ version? Will it drop the "duplicate" at /news/ 
even though it has your backlinks?

Another consideration - what if half the world links to your /news/ and 
the other half to /news. Is your incoming "link juice" being split 
across the two unique URLs? Would you benefit more if the /news was a 
301 redirect to /news/ (where a 301 redirect is followed by Google, 
including the flow of link juice?)

I believe it is best to leave these matters up to the webmaster, not the 
webmaster's competitors nor the Google engineers.

Would be something like:

@/news/([0-9]+)?/([0-9]+)?/([0-9]+)?@

But I think it should either be a completely valid date or now by  
default.

Also isn't there a mode to preg_match or a version in which you can  
get named parameters?

How optional? Why use preg_match at all?

list( $app, $year, $month, $day ) = explode( '/', $uri );

Amazing! I did just try it and that actually works. You can use a PHP 
script to replace a directory. I thought there had to be something that 
easy, but I've never seen it done that way.

I think what Ken last suggested amounts to the same thing, but I 
couldn't quite see how his example actually worked.

It is indeed pretty obscure. I wonder if this is documented anywhere?

Ahh ... named patterns, how extremely ugly :-)

$date = "/2007/08/06";
preg_match("/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})\/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})\/(?P<day>[0-9] 
{2})/", $date, $match);
print_r($match);

Hi Jon,

That works great. Thanks.

> But I think it should either be a completely valid date or now by default.

Perhaps. I think it could make sense to have some parameters optional.
I really just wanted to make sure I know how to make URL parameters
optional.

> named parameters?

That's no problem. I have the parameter names in a parallel array so I
just loop through the matches and build a new array. Then my get_param
and set_param functions get or set params from or to $_POST, $_GET and
$url_params in that order of precedence. That abstraction also assists
with building URLs (e.g. if a parameter came from the URL you can
build a URL with URL parameters).

Thanks,
Mike

Hi there:

I've noticed a lot of web sites using this technique.  I know this  
stuff always changes, but one potential caveat:  the last I knew,  
search engines were either ignoring or ranking down anything after  
the xxxx.php in the URL when people use this structure.

Meaning, essentially,

http://www.something.com/script.php/some/other/thing

is not as good as

http://www.something.com/script/some/other/thing

from Google's point of view.

So, easier, yes, but it might give you some unwanted side effects.   
Again, this information might have changed, or even might have been  
wrong in the first place, but since mod_rewrite is so dead simple to  
use, IMO it's not worth the risk.

Maybe someone else can either clarify or refute my claim.

Cheers,

Marc

Well, if you're passing the file through a script, it helps to tell 
the client some things by setting proper headers. Content-type, 
Content-disposition and Content-length, for starters.

Download is the responsibility of the client. This isn't in PHP's domain.

Yes, they amount to the same thing, but one has the .php extension and 
one does not.

It was weird to me when pointed out at first.  What the .htaccess 
setting is doing is telling Apache to process an entry that looks like 
'news' as a php script.  Also, "entries" here means a file or a 
directory segment.  The key is knowing that apache parses from left to 
right, not the other way around.  So as soon as it finds 'news', it 
passes control to that file as a php script and apache itself is now 
finished.

Methinks its a basic apache thing.

Save yourself time + use this package (or something equivalent):

Quite true - mod_perl can do more, but as far as I know, still not as much
as Tomcat since they're linked at the hip.

While it seems like a good idea, it'd probably cause more grief... think of
all those poor images, CSS, PDFs, JS, static HTML, etc. files out there that
we assume get served directly, correctly, statically - and quickly - right
from the filesystem.

Well that essentially exists with AddHandler and friends in Apache, and is
essentially the crux of many of the techniques described in this thread.

Agreed - I'm still waiting for XSLT to take us by storm.  And I keep that
Javascript turned off in my browser, since no web site should depend on it
being available... right?

The aliasing is happening within the web server to get around direct
filesystem/URL mapping - it's up to the business logic of the application to
serve different resources, which is the flexibility we're after.  This
determination can happen in the application, dynamically and during request
time, rather than being dictated by the filesystem.

Both true. XSLT is indeed an awesome technology. The reason why it 
doesn't catch on is that XML and XSLT is designed for machines to read 
and not for humans. Just see how difficult it is for many to create 
proper HTML!

> Web's 20 ?= Web 2.0  It's just a decimal point away...

With broadband being very expensive and about anything Web 2.0 being 
created only for profit there will be a long time to go. And also, what 
is wrong out of a sudden with fat clients and desktop apps?

But that's what caching proxies are for!

You're totally right, though, being able to mix and match gets a lot
more out of a single server instance.

There may not be a lot of XSLT on the web yet, but there's more than 
you'd think; especially if you get to look behind the curtains. Many 
more sites are using it internally than are exposing it publicly.

And in some fields such as publishing XSLT has been an absolute godsend. 
It's much less heralded than PHP or Rails, but to me it's a far more 
powerful and productive language for the uses for which it's intended. 
That is, XSLT improves my productivity when doing XMLish things more 
than PHP improves my productivity when doing Webish things. I'm not 
saying XSLT is a general purpose web development language like PHP. It's 
definitely true that the use cases for XSLT are somewhat more 
specialized than the use cases for PHP. I.e. more people want to do 
webby things than XML things.

Of course, if you really want to rock, try combining 
XQuery+XQueryP+APP+a native XML database. Once the tooling matures a 
bit, that's a stack that's going to make all previous web dev frameworks 
look like PowerBuilder. Hmm, need a good acronym for that one: LAXQE 
perhaps? (Linux+Atom Publishing Protocol+XQuery+eXist) Have to work on 
that a bit. :-)

The headers I mentioned earlier are easy to send using PHP's header() 
function.

If I'm creating a large CSV file that I want the user to save to disk, 
and I want the browser to display meaningful download status, I'd do 
something like:

<?PHP
// $data contains a big string of comma-separated-value text
header('Content-type: text/csv');
header('Content-length: ' . strlen($data)); // if I was passing through 
some file on disk, i'd use filesize($someFile)
header('Content-disposition: attachment;filename="data.csv"');
echo $data
?>

For upload progress bars, swfupload, mentioned by Jon, works very well 
(usually).  There's a fork of it that does some extra useful stuff.  
Read about it here: http://linebyline.blogspot.com/index.html?rn=1150

That's really something very different, and something I'm very skeptical of.

Not a chance.  There is no such thing as a native XML database and there 
never will be because XML is a file format (oops, data format), and an 
extremely inefficient one at that.  To have a native database you need a 
data model.  XML uses the hierarchical model and if you're going to 
build a native hierarchical database you sure wouldn't use the wasteful 
XML format internally to store the data.

And if you insist on using XML just because its so wonderful to use 17 
characters to store the state <STATE>NY</STATE>, it will never be able 
to compete with even the most immature relational engines for pure 
speed.  Maybe on example and toy sites, but never for anything that 
needs to scale.

If I'm wrong, dinner's on me.

Don't worry! Finally someone who sees XML as what it is and that it is 
by far not as glorious and the key to world peace as many claim. In the 
end XML is an ini file on steroids. And XML without DTD is only half of 
the pie....so much for self-defining.

I worked on projects where the project manager insisted on taking all 
SQL queries, converting them to XML just so that the database layer can 
convert them from XML back to SQL. I asked why not talk SQL directly to 
the database. The answer was that we have to have XML in it, just so 
that we can be open to third parties. Huh? That was for an embedded 
system and there aren't many (any?) db engines around that don't 
understand at least some SQL.

I think XML sucks. So now let's see what we can do with XML.

If all you do is INI files, then all you'll use XML for is INI files. 
Some of us do a little more than that though.

Roughly 80% of the world's data cannot plausibly be stored in a 
relational database. The 20% that does fit there is important enough 
that we've spent the last 20 years stuffing it into relational databases 
and doing interesting things with it. I'm still doing a lot of that.

But there's a lot more data out there that doesn't look like tables than 
does. Much of this data fits very nicely in a native XML database like 
Mark Logic or eXist. There's also data that has some tabular parts and 
some non-tabular parts. This may work well in a hybrid XML-relational 
database like DB2 9.

If your only place to put pegs is a table with square holes, then you're 
going to try pound every peg you find into a square hole. However, some 
of us have noticed that a lot of the pegs we encounter aren't shaped 
like squares, and sometimes we need to buy a different table with 
different shaped holes. :-)

Relational databases didn't take the world by storm overnight. XML 
databases won't either. But they will be adopted because they do let 
people solve problems they have today that they cannot solve with any 
other tools.

Which part do you have to be wrong about for me to get a free dinner? I 
can already give you several existence proofs demonstrating that there 
is such a thing as a native XML database:

My problem is that I don't get paid 500k/year for working 10 hours a 
week with full benefits and 8 weeks paid vacation. Now, show me how to 
fix that with XML databases and dinner is on me, twice even. ;)

The best thing about XML is that it is really is just a flat file and 
everything in it has a beginning and an end. I cannot think of anything 
that one would want to store in XML that cannot be stored in a db and 
that also cannot be stored in a text file with way less overhead. 
Examples are welcome.

A sourceforge project does not a phenomenon make.  I guess when the 
banks and airlines have our data in the XML files, and I don't mean a 
few hybrid patchwork examples, I mean the hardcore permanent long-term 
stuff as well as the transactional support for the reservations we're 
making all day.  When that happens, we'll start picking the restaurants.

I think XML is the cleanest method to abstract not only content from  
design, but from code as well.  If you take a look at this sample  
site, you can see a simple implementation.  I'm working up a generic  
framework or CMS that will use this approach.

http://jmcentire.ath.cx:8080/

If you have any suggestions, I'm happy to hear them.  But most of my  
current websites are many pages, one script sorts of websites.  I  
don't like Smarty or other similar solutions; but, in using XSLT, I  
can generate any sort of output I need -- like RSS or XHTML... or CSV.

Maybe you can implement a similar solution?

There are a number of things which are a much better fit for XML
rather than a database or a flat file... such as arbitrary depth/width
tree structures.

For example, when I worked at the Library of Congress answering the
Ultimate Geek Question, we were working with such trees in the
digitization process.  Handling arbitrary width in a database is basic
but handling arbitrary depth quickly gets you into a table structure
that looks like:

tableName - id, displayOrder, parent_id

While that seems simple, it gets to be quite nasty quite quickly
because of the recursive database queries to pull everything back...
and you need to convert it to the actual tree before you can do much
with it.  Using a Lazy Loader improves things a bit, but you're just
spreading out the work.

Alternatively, with the XML, it's already in the tree.  Add in a
simple recursive template and storing it as XML (in a db or native
XML) and you can render it in html/whatever in one fell swoop.  It's
really kind of nifty when it's done right.

The same applies to work breakdown structures...  *cough*dotProject*cough*.

One disclaimer... when I was at the LoC, Elliote's XML Bible was one
of our core resources.

Json will be standard from php5.2 onwards. But for those of us that are a
bit behind, what json library do you recommend for development, knowing that
it will be phased out as we switch to the native php5.2 json extension?

I've never said native XML databases will replace the old-school apps 
like banking accounts that fit relational databases very well. What they 
will do is enable new applications that simply cannot be built on top of 
a relational database, applications like Safari (the book site, not the 
web browser):

http://safari.oreilly.com/

There are others, mostly in publishing because that's the first area 
where there's a large backlog of information and applications that 
relational database vendors have been unable to serve. However other 
companies will come online as they begin to realize they can manage all 
their data with these tools, not just the the 20% of it that fits neatly 
into rectangles. Expect to see more uptake in law firms, advertising, 
media, education, government, and other sectors that have large numbers 
of critical documents where order matters, duplication is a fact of 
life, and normalization is not just a bad idea out outright impossible.

The relational model is a very powerful model, but it achieves its power 
at the cost of restricting what it's possible to store. Other models are 
needed for other applications.

You need to remember we're talking about XML databases that store 
collections of XML documents, not simply a single XML document. A single 
relational record can be easily stored in a tab-delimited text file with 
way less overhead too. But when you have millions of these things that 
you have to sort, search, update, backup, specify access permissions, 
and so forth, then the database begins to show its worth.

With that in mind, consider:

The Encyclopedia Britannica
The collected publications of O'Reilly Media
The complete work product of Skadden-Arps
The New York Times
The collected works of William Shakespeare and other Elizaebthan dramatists

Then consider that you want to be able to make queries like, "Find all 
the paragraphs containing both the words 'Bush' and 'incompetent'" so 
you can't just shove everything into a BLOB.

By that argument, the current RDBMS use 7 characters to store a state:
StateNY.

Of course, we'd use the same for an XML-based DBMS for storage with  
logic that constructs:
<STATE>NY</STATE> upon request.  Since, we all know that the state  
code requires some extra characters so that the DBMS could organize  
it.  A file with no meta-data that said: NYMONJOKTXAZCA wouldn't make  
much sense, would it?

Just answered my own question. Installing the json pecl extension (which is
what?s used in PHP5.2+) is trivial. It?s in xampp or avail as a dll
elsewhere, and you just need to add the extension to your php.ini file.

Test:
$arr = array('dog'=>1,2,3=>array(1,2,3));
echo '{"sample":'.json_encode($arr).'}';

Result:
"sample":{"dog":1,"0":2,"3":[1,2,3]}}

I have been trying to learn php development by installing xampp on my pc. The problem i am having is that i am able to save my php scripts and run them successfully but when i started trying to write programs that have to connect to the mysql database it started giving me all kinds of errors.
 
So my guess is that i am not being able to connect to the mysql db even though phpmyadmin seems to be connecting to it. I tried reading all these php forum tips on pinging mysql, etc but i dont seem to be making any clear headway.
 
Can anyone please HELP me by giving me some good tips on pinging and troubleshooting my problem. Please find below a list of my environment info ;

For starters, seeing the exact errors you are getting would be helpful. Also
helpful will be the snippets of code where those errors are pointing to.

Your best bet is to download the tools from MySQL's website. PHPMyAdmin 
is a nice tool, but I am sure anyone will hit its limits after...ohhh, 
about five minutes. Since you can do whatever you want with your MySQL 
server create a database schema first, then create a user name and 
password, and for the time being assign that user full rights to that 
schema. Schemas are also called catalogs, MySQL Administrator isn't very 
consistent with that. Of course, adding at least one table to that 
schema will help a lot, otherwise you cannot do more than connect.

Hope this helps,

	David

Yeah... that's a funny little class.  I'm pretty sure I remember  
people on the Zend Framework arguing that it should have been taken  
out.  It does abstract json encoding/decoding though so that you  
don't have to rely on the extension.

Not to mention that the utility of XML is not simply inherent in it's  
being small.  No one is claiming that it is small.  But, there is  
utility there that makes it worth the size.  There is always a  
tradeoff.  To complain about XML because it takes more characters to  
store data or lays it out in a manner that isn't the same old RDBM  
isn't valid.  I'd entertain it if I thought you wrote code in a  
binary format the machine understands natively.  I don't think you  
do.  All that wasted white-space... for shame.

*Grin*  Seriously.  With any abstraction comes overhead and a loss of  
flexibility or power.  XML doesn't do everything perfectly.  But, it  
fits a lot of things well-enough.  *Shudder*  I sound like an  
engineer now rather than a mathematician.  Yet, it is a valid  
argument, I suppose.  I've heard it enough times now to repeat it.

Jeremy I'm not sure if you're serious.  You do know that the entire 
response is, as we say, "not even wrong", it's so incorrect that it 
can't be corrected.

I think the scary reality is that those banks and CC companies are
generally managing all their database  needs with some abstracted
Cobol.  It does the job.  Everyone's afraid to touch it. And the folks
that built it died years ago.  yipes!

Of course, one advantage of an XML database is that there are no rules 
about what the actual disk format looks like. What matters is what goes 
ion and what comes out. Databases are free to make optimizations for 
both storage space and speed, and in practice most do. The disk format 
is no more relevant to the XQuery data model than it is to the SQL data 
model. Storing a million documents in an XML database may well take a 
lot less space than storing them in individual files.

Nope, not the same thing at all.

Index engines like FAST and Lucene can do part of this (though they 
can't really take advantage of the structure of the documents they 
index). However those are *non-relational* systems. Of course if you 
want to search web-size collections, relational databases just can't 
handle it. Index engines are the only proven technology that can.

Mark Logic claims their native XML database can search web size 
collections too, but I remain to be convinced of that point.

Some relational databases have added non-relational, fulltext search 
extensions to their products just as some have added non-relational XML 
extensions. These are adequate for simple uses, if you don't push them 
too hard. However they are completely incapable of carrying out queries 
like, "Give me the title and first paragraph of every chapter of this 
book" (something Safari routinely does) because they don't see the 
structure of a document, only the text.

Hi Again,

I'm working on a site and I'd like to give the user a little more
control over the font size throughout the site. Something like those
"AAAAA" controls on sites that allow the user to select x-large,
large, regular, small, or x-small. How is that best done?

So far I've just been using <small> and CSS small and x-small.
Relative values are nice because the user can still change font size
using their browser (ctrl-+ ctrl-- in FF). But that leaves me somewhat
at a loss as to how to globally affect the font size. Is there a CSS
property that can globally increase and decrease the font size
throughout the entire page? What is the basis for good font size
control?

Mike

If you want good font size control, set the font size of your body to 62.5%
This should effectively give you a starting size of 10px. Then you can
use the magic of ems to scale your fonts with pixel perfection.
1.6em gives you 16px font.
1.2em gives you 12px font and so on.

Even though you have font sizing to the pixel, it's still able to be
changed by the browser as desired.

As far as the AAA controls, the easiest way I've seen to do this is to
have alternate style sheets for each font size, then use javascript to
switch between them. I'm hoping you have a few sites to refer to and
figure out the logistics of it all, but that's the basic concept.

Changing the font-size of the body has no effect on text within td
elements. Changing the font-size on td elements has no effect on form
input elements like buttons. Etc, etc, etc. This problem can't be
*that* hard. Is there really no better way to control font-size of all
page elements simultaneously?

To control font size at a global CSS level, try:

* { font-size : XX; }

For a JavaScript way of changing font size (using the above), I use
something like (note that n is populated by clicking buttons corresponding
to values 10, 12, and 14):

function adjustText (n) {
  for (var i = 0; i < document.styleSheets.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < document.styleSheets [i].rules.length; j++) {
      if (document.styleSheets [i].rules [j].selectorText == "*" ||
document.styleSheets [i].rules [j].selectorText == "") {
        // Set new size
        document.styleSheets [i].rules [j].style.fontSize = (n + "pt");

        return;
      }
    }
  }
}

This may not be exactly what you're looking for, but it's hopefully a good
start.

My personal preference is to use the following rule:

* {
  font-size: 100%;
}

to reset the size of all fonts to 100% of the parent element, then set a
size on the body tag as your baseline, eg:

body {
  font-size: small;
}

Now everything will have the same font size, and changing the font size
on the body will affect everything.

Obviously some things need to have larger or smaller fonts, so you can
set them up as well, eg:

h1 {
  font-size: 150%;
}

At this point you can set the size of everything by overriding the
font-size of the body, and everything else will scale accordingly.

HTH,

Dan

The problem has to do with serializing/unserializing objects (which 
sessions do in the background).

When you serialize an entire class, it only saves the classes 
properties, not the methods within. (open up a serialized object file to 
see what i mean).  When you unserialize it, you'll be creating a 
variable with all the properties of a class.  If you've defined that 
class (in your case, by requiring the class file before unserializing 
it), it will instantiate the class and fill in the proper properties and 
then put it into your variable.  Otherwise it will create an 
'incomplete' class that only has the same name and all the saved 
properties, but no methods.

Here's some other info on the subject as well

Just make font-size jump the table boundary using:

table { font-size: inherit; }

Tom, your tip about 62.5% is one I've never run across before. Nice!

I think the best (as in, most comprehensive) way to go about this is
to put in the work and create multiple stylesheets. For all but the
most simple and flexible of designs, increasing the font size will
crowd or break some design elements.

It's much nicer for visually-impaired users to see a properly
proportioned design at the largest size, rather than giant text
squeezed into standard-size columns. You can also replace images that
need to be larger, tweak icon sizes, etc.

I'm glad we have multiple tools to bring to bear on this kind of
problem, because I worry about the performance implications of
querying an XML database for the average price of those books, or
performing an operation that adds another field (tag?) to each book's
"record".

If it's not too much trouble, could you give us some other use cases
for an XML database? Because title and first paragraph, if that's
something a system "routinely does" could easily be stored as
relational data at the time of import.

Rusty, you appear to be arguing from ignorance, very unusual coming from 
you.

The true difference between us in this argument is that I understand 
that I have a prejudice for relational over hierarchical, based on my 
knowledge and use of both, and based on judgment calls as to how to get 
through the day.  I daresay however that you are promoting a religious 
favoring of XML w/o a working knowledge of the alternatives.

You simply cannot defend a file format as a foundation for frameworks 
and databases.  The best you can do is defend the model, such as the 
hierarchical model.

Going further, you cannot defend a file format as a foundation for 
anything based on how it handles large text (or binary) fields.  There 
are three issues here:

-> Data model, hierarchical vs. relational. 
-> File format, XML vs YAML or JSON or any other format you like
-> Handling of large text (and binary) columns.

Finally, if we can all admit that XML is just a file format, then the 
entire framework crumbles as soon as somebody comes up with a better 
one, because let's admit it, XML is just about the worst you're going to 
find.

In conclusion, the examples you provide appear to give advantage to XML 
because tools exist to handle data that has been buried in opaque 
formats and poorly defined structures.  If the data had been structured 
properly in the first place and put into formats that were not so 
opaque, using (pardon me for saying) a *real* database, designed on 
solid principles, the examples you give become child's play.

For reference I think it refers to the "CSS Reset" methodology ...

http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/

-snip-
font-size:62.5%;
Why? All popular browsers has default font size equal 16px. If we set  
font size equal 62.5% then font size is equal 10px at screen (but not  
set 10px, IE6 not resize this rule). Now we have 1em = 10px, so  
1..1em=11px etc. It is easier way to calculate font size.

++++++++++++++++++++++++
=======================

Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software
Foundation, Inc.

   This file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives
unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.)

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need
`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using
a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a
time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the
package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring
for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

will cause the specified gcc to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).

`configure' Invocation
======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.

 From what I recall most of the framework objects should already have  
a __toString() overload on them so you can just echo/dump the select  
itself.

Message-ID: <C2E0E231.6B53%cliff@pinestream.com>

My Ajax response handler uses this line, which is fairly typical:

var output = req.responseText;

>From php, I?m echoing back json. Example: {"status":1,"count":0,"data":""}

But instead of var output being an object, it is a string:
?{"status":1,"count":0,"data":""}?

How do I make this an object?

I'm not great with Javascript and I know next to nothing about Json, but I
know responseText will return a string, and PHP will output a string, so you
need to use javascript to use javascript to take the string and un-serialize
it (I don't know if this is technically un-serializing or not, but... make
an object out of a string)
So... yeah.. javascript issue for sure. Hope someone else can help you more
(and I'd like to know the answer too for my own education)

As usual, figured it out minutes after my post. Answer for the group:

From: var output = req.responseText;
To:     var output = eval('('+req.responseText+')');

Better answer ? don?tr try to reinvent the wheel. Yeah but we can?t help
ourselves. Xajax looks very cool....

Yes eval(), which always makes me a little queasy, even though I know
it's relatively safe. I wonder how many years we'll be waiting for a
true json_decode() function to make it into general circulation?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] simplexml xpath bug ? (long post)
In-Reply-To: <20070809160403.8DB26508F2@net-pollen.com>

Hi there,

I'm not sure if this is the way it?s supposing to work or if this is  
a bug. Anyway, here's the problem.

I have to parse a very complex XML document where I need to do a  
xpath query against a previous found xpath query.

I use simplexml for that.

For the sake of the discussion, I wrote a script to illustrate the  
problem (see below or the attachment). And yes, with this example, I  
could use just one xpath query to get the same result. But this is an  
example, so bare with me.

Ok let's start.

* What I want to do: *

Do a xpath query against a previous xpath query.

* What happened: *

The second xpath query is made against the whole xml tree instead of  
a subset of the tree found by the first xpath query.

* Work-around: *

You have to deference the tree.

* My question *

Clearly, what I see is not what I get when I use var_dump or print_r  
against the second xpath query. I wonder if there is a bug here.  
Also, why the fragment of XML that I get from the first xpath query  
still reference the whole tree.

Thanks!


=========================


* Example: The Script*

$xml = <<<END
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<world>
   <continent name='europe'>
     <country name='france'>paris</country>
     <country name='uk'>london</country>
   </continent>
   <continent name='africa'>
     <country name='zimbabwe'>harare</country>
     <country name='egypt'>cairo</country>
   </continent>
</world>
END;

$obj      = simplexml_load_string ($xml);
$result   = $obj->xpath ('//continent');

echo "----------------\n";
echo "result\n";
echo "----------------\n";
var_dump ($result);
echo "\n\n";

$counter = 0;
foreach ($result as $elem) {
   $counter++;
   echo "----------------\n";
   echo "Counter: $counter\n";
   echo "----------------\n";


   echo "----------------\n";
   echo "elem\n";
   echo "----------------\n";
   var_dump ($elem);
   echo "\n";

   echo "----------------\n";
   echo "elem->xpath('//country')\n";
   echo "----------------\n";
   var_dump ($elem->xpath ('//country'));

   $elem2 = simplexml_load_string ($elem->asXML ());
   echo "----------------\n";
   echo "elem2->xpath('//country')\n";
   echo "----------------\n";
   var_dump ($elem2->xpath ('//country'));
}

This is not a PHP question.

When I print my web page, the background image does not print.
What do I need to do to make sure that the background image prints?

Thanks,

I hope someone else has a better answer, but... it's browser and
operating system dependent.

In Firefox on OSX, for instance, you go to Print, select Firefox from
the unlabeled printer settings selection menu (try explaining _that_
over the phone) and check Print Background Images.

OK, that helped me Chris.
On Firefox I went to Page Setup and I click on print Background and Images

On the Internet Explorer menus of the user:
Tools, Internet options, Advanced tab, scroll down to Printing,
tick Print background images and colours

Thanks,

json.org provides a json decoder for javascript. I've always used  
this instead of eval. This will only parse the json subset, and will  
fail for other arbitrary javascript.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Bizarre PHP putenv/getenv results
Message-ID: <007301c7daca$9f7f7d90$0802a8c0@bklos>

I'm wondering if anyone has seen this behavior at all
 
The system is Unixware 7.1.1 apache 1.3.34/php 4.4.2 which uses a lot of
binary cgi in the web app. In order to pass information to the cgi apps they
are placed in the environment via putenv then calls the cgi app. 
 
Occasionally, the environment variables are corrupted, usually ending up
with a blank page since the app has no or corrupt information to work from.
 
a simple example would be:
 
putenv("QUERY_STRING=$url");
putenv("HTTP_COOKIE=$HTTP_COOKIE");
 
$pipe = popen("./SD_disp", "r");
 
the only evidence I have that the environment is getting fouled up is in
phpinfo() which displays things like:
 
<option value =	 "EMERALD POINT">Emerald Point</option> 	
 
I can reproduce this behavior with a simple script that sets and unsets an
environment variable a couple of times
 
To further confuse things: 
 
This does not happen in Unixware 7.1.4
This does not happen when the Oracle database is localhost even though the
phpinfo() environment displays corruption
 
Any ideas or seen anything remotely similar? Any help would be appreciated
 
TIA,
 
Bob Klos

I have been hooked on jQuery.  AMAZING  JS stuff.  There is an
ajax/form plug in that will handle all this.  Serialize, JSON, zillion
options.  Mixing it all up with php, and you can do pretty much
anything.

http://jquery.com/

Plug in examples:

Message-ID: <02dc01c7dae3$0cf45900$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello All, 

I've created a "Mail this section" option for a FAQ/Information Center type page I'm working on.

It enables visitors to email themselves the contents of a particular section. But I'm running into trouble
when foreign/non a-zA-Z0-9 characters are present in the code (which is being pulled from the database).


Heres' a code snippet:


            $body .= "<a href=\"mailto:?Subject=Information Center&body="
                  . html_entity_decode(strip_tags(
                    str_replace(array("&", '"', "\\"), "", $dbObject->result['body']))) . "\""
                  . " class=\"email\">Email this section</a>";

Let me reformat that, heh:
$body = "<a href=\"mailto:?Subject=Information Center&body=". $dbObject->result['body'] . "\">Email me</a>";

So, what can I use on $dbObject->result['body'] to clean/strip away the text? You can see I was messing
with a few different options..I know & will break it, as well as " ... but lets just clear out everything (HTML, and all other characters EXCEPT aA-zZ 0-9 and maybe .,-

Any help, greatly appreaciated!

For future reference, the easiest way (in postDispatch()) was:

$dbAdapter = Zend_Registry::get( 'dbAdapter' );
$profiler = $dbAdapter->getProfiler( );
$query = $profiler->getLastQueryProfile( );
echo $query->getQuery( );

Personally, I think you're probably approaching this the wrong way.

Not only are you going to be generating huge links (which will cause all
kinds of grief), but your email will be horribly formatted and the user
still has to email it to themselves manually from their own mail
client...very confusing.

Why not have the link trigger a server-side process to send the mail?

You may need an input for the user to enter their email address, but
then you can format the mail in any way you like, using whatever
character set is appropriate for the content.

For bonus marks, attach it as a nicely formatted pdf!

As an aside, when creating any kind of url, there are 2 forms of
formatting you need to consider.

1. urlencode any query strings

2. html encode the entire url to make it html-safe

for example:

echo '<a href="'. htmlspecialchars('test.php?arg1='. urlencode('val1')
.'&arg2='. urlencode('value 2 with some odd characters & +')) .'">link</a>';

I define functions h() and u() as shortcuts for htmlspecialchars and
urlencode respectively, as I use them everywhere.

If you did want to make your current approach work, you would want to do
something like:

$body = '<a href="'. h('mailto:?Subject='. u('Information Center')
.'&body='. u($dbObject->result['body'])) .'">Email me</a>';

HTH,

Dan

Hello Dan,

Good point. I like your idea, but it adds a little more processing since I'd 
need to
be handling these pages w/sessions, to thwart potential misuse/abuse.

I like the attachment as a .pdf idea as well.

I'll have to see if its something the client wants before I get too far with 
it.
The code snippet you send me works for some, but doesn't work for others. 
Some characters
are still breaking it. Or maybe, mailto has a limit for body size.

Not sure.

Thank you!

I have near-zero experience with putenv(), but my first impression on
looking at the code is that it looks like it will break if shell
metacharacters or anything other than low ascii is in the php vars.

Could there be stray newlines or some other characters in the values
that would cause breakage?

That script makes it _much_ safer to parse untrusted json, and if
there was any way to exploit it at all, someone would have found it by
now.... but it still uses eval().

I don't think that's the case because 9 times out of 10 the page loads. 
If you hit refresh a few times you'll catch the error, then refresh and
it'll work again.

Hi Dan,

Well this is pretty much what I did and I have to say it actually
worked pretty well. No need for separate CSS files or JavaScript to go
with since I can dynamically change the body tag to specify a
different class.

Thanks,

Oosh, that sucks. It's a little brain-breaking because computers don't
generally do that. But it seems like you have a lot of moving parts
there, and you mentioned something about Oracle on localhost vs.
networked... could there be a timing issue, connections not getting
set up, packets being dropped, a firewall taking matters into its own
hands?

I'm grasping at straws of course...

Wouldn't it be simpler and more reliable to pipe the information between 
the programs via STDOUT and STDIN or pass the arguments on the command 
line?

It's interesting how the value of 62.5 keeps cropping up in science, 
but that's a different topic.

For what I do (see below), using 62.5% would be a nightmare.

I agree. It's a simple matter to use a php style-switch, I even 
provide one on my web site here:

http://sperling.com/examples/styleswitch1/

 From that you can tie in any number of style sheets to adjust font 
size to anything you want.

If that doesn't ring your bell, then you can assign variables inside 
css to change font size as you want, see how here:

http://sperling.com/examples/pcss/

>It's much nicer for visually-impaired users to see a properly

That's exactly what I do and for that exact reason.

If you tie everything to em's (I don't want to argue about what's 
best) and use font-size: 100% (or 100.1% for some browser bugs), then 
it becomes a simple matter to design a site to be "zoom cooperative" 
(<-- my term).

What this means simply is that no matter what zoom level the user 
uses, the site stays in the same relative configuration. I hate it 
when giant text is squeezed as you describe above.

Now, can normal web sites be "zoom cooperative" ? But of course they 
can, it just takes a bit of css to make it so -- as's described here:

http://sperling.com/examples/zoom/

And, if you want to see real web sites that do this, try these:

http://earthstones.com
http://webbytedd.com/clients/beckyscan

There are many, many more.

IMO, it's a good way to accommodate those with vision problems and do 
so without being obvious about accommodation.

Cheers,

tedd

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Joomla meetings, your feedback needed
Message-ID: <46BE571C.5090009@beezifies.com>

As some of you may be aware, I'm trying to get Joomla meetings going in NYC.

NYPHP will be providing space for us for a monthly Thursday meeting.  
I've been running polls on my website(I have been setting it up lately 
for my independent consulting work, since I have the space there anyway, 
I figured might as well use it.)

 From the poll feedback, it looks like either the second or third week 
of the month is likely to be the week of choice.

I will be at the NYPHP event on the 23rd of this month to meet people 
interested in going to monthly meetings so we can finalize a week.

I have also setup a new poll, slightly longer this time, to get some 
feedback on what types of presentations people are interested in.  For 
the most part, I've listed things I have done, or am in the process of 
doing, so if no one else wants to present I can at least plan on 
reviewing something of interest to the people coming to the meeting(just 
don't expect a "professional" presentation - I'll try to be informative 
and not withhold "secrets" - as I've found most Joomla books seem to do.)

The polls are under NYC Joomla SIG on the menubar, and active polls are 
displayed in the right hand menubar.  My website is http://www.beezifies.com

So go ahead an give me some feedback  - the only way we can do things 
you find interesting is if you tell me what you want.

Regexps can't do that though. Regular expression are an insufficiently

Funny how you confuse different experiences with ignorance. Have you 
ever worked in publishing? Or in library science? Or on anything that 
operates at web scale like Yahoo or Google? There are many use cases 
where a couple of months of hard labor will rapidly disabuse anyone of 
the belief that relational databases are the one true solution to all 
problems. Your career just happens not to have taken you down those 
paths yet.

Ken, you know me. Do you really think I don't know the relational model 
or what it's good for? I use relational databases all the time, and I'm 
using them now. However unlike you I've hit their limits. While I'm sure 
many people can profitably spend their life doing nothing but relational 
  databases, I happen to be working on applications where neither the 
relational model nor the actual SQL databases out there can come close 
to managing my data. I've never said that all applications should use 
XML databases or other non-relational systems, You keep trying to put 
those words into my mouth. I do say that some applications, especially 
in publishing and web publishing, do not fit the relational model well 
and can better served by XML databases.

XML is not a file format. We've been down this road before. A native XML 
database is no more based ona  file format than MySQL is based on tab 
delimited text.

LOL. Seriously, try storing a book or an encyclopedia in a relational 
database with anything approximating 1NF, not even 2NF. Then try and 
make it perform adequately.

Not all data fits neatly into tables.

Average prices, or adding a field, can be done pretty fast. I don't know 
if it's as fast as oracle or MySQL. I don't much care. Sales systems are 
exactly the sort of apps that relational databases fit well. But 
actually publishing the books? That's a very different story.

Just surf around Safari sometime. Think about what it's doing. Then try 
to imagine doing that on top of a relational database.

Think about combining individual chapters, sections, and even smaller 
divisions to make new on-off books like Safari U does. Consider the 
generation of tables of contents and indexes for these books.

Closer to home, think about a blogging system or a content management 
system. Now imagine what you could do if the page structure were 
actually queryable, and not just an opaque blob in MySQL somewhere.

Storing books, web pages, and the like in a relational database has only 
two basic approaches: make it a blob or cut it into tiny little pieces. 
The first eliminates search capabilities; the second performs like a dog.

You're right that if grabbing the title and the first paragraph is all 
you need to do, then these two pieces could be stored separately (and 
normalization be damned.) Now suppose the editor comes along and tells 
you they really want to show the first two paragraphs of text to 
non-logged in users instead of just the first one. If you know the 
queries in advance, you can layout the data to optimize them, but using 
the data's own structure will give you much more flexibility for 
unexpected uses.

Here's another common use case: extract the links from a web site. Do a 
Google-like reverse index that finds all the pages linking to this one. 
The only way to make that happen in a relational DB is to chop the 
content into so many trivially small pieces that putting them back 
together again is prohibitively expensive. And even once you've done 
that, the SQL to pull the result is ungodly ugly. The XQuery is a lot 
simpler because it matches the natural structure of the documents rather 
than treating everything as a table. Some data wants to live in tables. 
Some doesn't.

Do you have any recommended reading on XML CMS? Do you know of any

This is a fascinating discussion.  I can see how an NXD might be a very 
good fit for medical information systems where a logic encounter record 
might encompass dozens of normalized relational model tables.  What are 
some of the stable, production-worthy open source servers out there?

Hello:
Is there a command that is used to open a page after performing an action?
I created a php script that will add items to a database and  would like to be able to open a view page that would show the newly added item.
I am not able to use the insertgoto command and would like to know if there is another command that can be used?
thanks

Absolutely it would.
Had the program been written after '95 it might have been done that way :)

Wouldn't it be simpler and more reliable to pipe the information between the
programs via STDOUT and STDIN or pass the arguments on the command line?

So I need to apply an upgrade, but have no idea what changes I?ve made to
the original software. Paranoia keeps me from applying the patch ? don?t
want to lose any of my changes. I?d like to have a complete printout of my
changed files before I apply the upgrade patch so I know where to look when
the inevitable problems crop up.

But hey, I use Subversion, so I?m doing something right. This is what I have
done as a start:

I used ?compare with working copy? in the Tortoise SVN log window, which
gave me a list of changed files from my current rev and the original very
dated sw install.

This produced a list of files (in a file window) in TortoiseMerge that can
be viewed individually for diffs.

But how do I print/capture this file list and associated diff? I don?t see
any way to print the changed files other than writing them by hand. And I
don?t see any way to view the changes other than file by file. Is the diff
or file list stored locally? Suggestions?

Subversion is great, and can help you with this task (and many others).

I would first suggest that you read the svn book:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

Basically, you're trying to solve a non-problem.

Because you're using svn, you can retrieve any revision of your code at
any time, so you can always pull the latest revision before you apply
the patches from upstream.

If you have any problems you can a) revert your working copy and try
again (if you haven't committed anything yet), or b) roll back the
repository to the latest un-broken revision (if you committed broken code).

You may also want to check out vendor branches:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html

I have used this strategy in the past to maintain codebases coming from
upstream authors, and it works very well.

Basically you create a branch with the upstream release you are
currently using, then apply patches from upstream to that branch to keep
it in sync with the upstream version.

At any time you can then merge those changes into your development
branch, taking advantage of svn's built-in conflict resolution system to
handle any issues, rather than just getting stuck with patches that
won't apply cleanly.

Cliff,
I haven't come across anything that does what you are trying to do. But, may
I ask why? You are trying to keep track of something that svn already keeps
track of for you. I say use the tool like it was intended. If you are that
unsure of the commit, make a note of the current revision as a baseline. You
can use the log viewer (in both CLI and Tortise) to see the diffs between
any revision, at any point in the future. If you have to, you can go back to
the baseline. Either by specific file, or the whole commit. I think of it as
"reverse merge" because you are merging the old revision changes in to a new
revision file.

The closest I can come to answering your question is the revision graph. It
will produce a hierarchical representation of all the major changes to a
file., but might not tell you what you are looking for.

I think I got the message. So this is the appropriate time to create a
branch. My current base become trunk and perhaps tag it as V1; make a V2
branch of this; make my working copy point to the new branch, apply the
vendor's upgrade, then -- when I'm ready, merge the branch into the trunk?
Is that the jist of it?

Use a repository structure like this?

I guess I need to learn more about the patch process. Here?s what I?m
thinking. The vendor?s upgrade will attempt to patch hundreds of files. Yet,
I?m only concerned about the 100 or so that I have changed. So when things
fail, where do I look? A diff post-upgrade will show hundreds of file
changes, yet I?m only concerned about  the files I previously changed.

Now I have heard that patches will fail if I have made changes. The diff
file is the diff between the vendor?s new code and the original code, not
the code with my changes. If this is the case, it will be simple to see
where the patches fail. This would make life a lot easier.

Cliff,

I would strongly recommend that you read the svn book
(http://svnbook.red-bean.com/), which will answer many of your questions.

By using the vendor branch mechanism outlined in chapter 7, you can
solve the problem you are facing the right way and avoid future
headaches.  A vendor branch is not the same thing as a 'normal' branch
used for feature development, and you will need to have a solid grasp of
svn fundamentals to avoid getting yourself into trouble.

Dan

Here's a press release put out today on a healthcare provider that appears 
to be using XML in DB9 v9 for that sort of thing.  Express-C is free (not 
open source though) and comes with the pureXML feature.

Ah, now _that's_ a great example, and something that CMS developers
often need to do after the fact (as in link-checking, or generating a
graph of sites you link to for SEO purposes).

My first instinct would be to look for XPath support in my relational
db, and indeed MySQL does this:
http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-5.1-xml.html

But if a native-XML database can do it better or much more efficiently
for large datasets, then it is certainly worth investigating.

Immediately following this conversation I stopped by B&N to pick up  
this book:

http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596006349
XQuery by Priscilla Walmsley

It mainly goes over XPath 2.0 vs. 1.0 for most of the book, but  
overall it is a *great* insight into the topic.  Also very good  
examples on FLWOR (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLWOR).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] fgetcsv and German characters
Message-ID: <5F2DACEE-5A0B-4946-B352-3FB06102A182@capellic.com>

Oh, how I love character encoding problems!  ;-)

I have a file upload utility whereby the user uploads a CSV  
document.  The file is saved to a temporary folder.  I open that  
document, use fgetcsv() to pull the values and then insert them into  
a database.

The problem is that German characters such as ? and ? are being  
translated to ? and ? respectively when I echo the values to the  
browser and when inserted into the DB.  I wrote the values to the  
error log and they come out to \x9f and \x8a respectively.

I learned that I should use the setlocale() function for German:

	$loc_de = setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE');

But that didn't do anything for me.  I even tried as shown in the  
example for setlocale() on php.net:

	$loc_de = setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE at euro', 'de_DE', 'de', 'ge');

When I echo $loc_de, both say "de_DE" as expected, but it doesn't fix  
my import problem.

I've checked the uploaded file contents and it looks fine.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Stephen

Locale wouldn't matter in this case; that's primarily useful when
generating content (such as formatted dates or gettext translations).

You need to figure out what encoding was used on the original csv
document, and then use iconv functions or similar to convert it to
utf-8 or whatever encoding is being used by your system for storage
and display.

How to do that? I would open the csv file in a web browser and play
with the character encodings until it looked right--View>Character
Encoding in Firefox--but there might be a more systematic way...

The health care industry has embraced XML probably more than any other. 
  It's virtually impossible to build EHR/EMR software without XML 
support and still be compliant.  I believe eClinicalWorks stores its 
data in XML too.

Interesting... \x9f and \x8a are not valid Latin-1/8895 characters.   My
guess is that the CSV's are UTF-8 and your database is Latin-1.  If that is
the case, try converting the csv to 8859-1 with utf8_decode().

It is a bit of a hack, but it should work if the only languages you support
are german/spanish/french/english.  If you want your code to work with all
languages, you need to change the db encoding to utf8, and make sure all
input and output is UTF8.

Let's not forget MS embracing XML all over the place, too.

I just ran across this in a vCard, which means that directory software
and crm systems would also benefit from queryable XML support...

That's odd, because they have examples in the comments in the  
documentation on php.net that it does.  However, my experience is in  
line with your statement.  ;-)

I am not on Windows, so Office documents don't open in my browser.   
Any other suggestions?

I've tried to use utf8_decode() as well as using iconv to translate  
between UTF-8 AND ISO-8859-1 with no luck.  I guess that leads me to  
believe that the file is encoded in neither of the standards?

Is there any way to tell what the encoding is from within Excel?  (I  
didn't see anything in Excel and Google didn't have anything to  
offer.)  I have the original Excel file.

I am not even at the DB layer yet.

You will never be able to figure out what is going on from within
Excel.  Microsoft uses a lot of character set conversion/autodetection
magic across their products (heuristic determination of character
set).  You need to open the csv with a text editor that let's you
change the display encoding.  Once you know what the source encoding
is, and the destination encoding you want, you can use

I did some searching and \x9f and \x8a represent ? and ? in MS-1252.

And you will want 'profiler' => true in your db config.

Yeah, that's probably why.  We only ever work in large deployments, which of
course have dedicated servers.  .htaccess is thus evil, and slower.  Neither
clients nor I ever intend to support free-hosting-of-the-month-club.com for
our applications.

Yes - Apache is already aware of the extensions of files for which to
process through PHP.  The /support/ alias in my example is really just for
convenience and to keep developers in line.  Apache already knows how to
serve files correctly because of AddType (or even ForceType) and their
extension.  Thus, a .php file will trigger the auto_prepend to fire, and
startup the application framework.

So using a rewrite rule is redundant, and a hack in my opinion.  This is the
fundamental difference between rewriting and aliasing.

Message-ID: <00a801c7dea5$8a388b00$9ea9a100$@com>

I have been staring at this for about a week and it is turning into a mind
bender.  Here is the code excerpt:

 

// pre: none

// post: displays our controls for .

function displayControls()

{

        if($_POST['editjob'])

        {

                $query = "SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id`
=".$_POST['id']."";

                $result = mysql_query($query) or die("Error editing data.");

                $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result, MYSQL_ASSOC);

 

                echo "Debug: ".$_POST['id']." - ".$row['id']."\n";

 

                // display all our form data

                echo "<fieldset style='color: #ffffff;'><legend>Edit a
job</legend>\n".

                                "<form action='".$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']."'
method='post'>\n".

                                "Recruiter: <input name='recruiter'
type='text' value='".$row['recruiter']."'></br>".

                                " Job ID: <input name='jobid' type='text'

                                " Position: <input name='position'

                                " Position Link: <input name='link'

                                " Additional Info: <input

                                " Salary: <input name='salary' type='text'

                                " Hiring Manager: <input

                                " Status: <input name='status' type='text'

                                " Postings: <input name='postings'
type='text' value='".$row['postings']."'></br>".

                                " Job Color: \n".

                                "<select name='color'>\n".

                                "<option value='#ff0000'>Red</option>\n".

                                "<option value='#ffa500'>Orange</option>\n".

                                "<option value='#ffff00'>Yellow</option>\n".

                                "<option value='#00ff7f'>Spring

                                "<option value='#32cd32'>Lime

                                "<option value='#c0c0c0'>Silver</option>\n".

                                "<option value='#0000cd'>Medium

                                "<option value='#191970'>Midnight
Blue</option>\n".

                                "<option value='#4169e1'>Royal
Blue</option>\n".

                                "<option value='#c71585'>Medium Violet
Red</option>\n".

                                "<option
value='#ff00ff'>Fuchsia</option>\n".

                                "</select>\n".

                                "<input name='saveedit' type='submit'
value='Save Edit'>".

                                "<input name='cancel' type='submit'
value='Cancel'>".

                                "</form>".

                        "</fieldset>\n";

        }

 

... Rest of application.

 

Now the big problem are the three PHP statements after the "if" statement.
When I click edit job nothing appears even in the debug statement, I am not
returning a valid id from $row['id'] nor does any of the data appear in the
form(which is just an integer).  I have scrutinized the SQL query a million
times, even tried to qualify it with the database name using
`foobar`.`jobsdb` and that still not do anything.  I know the $_POST['id']
variable is passing the right id based on the echo command.  Is this a SQL
issue or a PHP issue?  I have looked at my databases in phpMyAdmin and even
checked them using the command line on our box and they have the right
permissions for the users that can access them.  If this is  a SQL issue can
you guys point me in the right direction?  I was thinking of pulling my data
base handle code and the SQL queries and just throwing them into a bare
script to see what happens.  If anyone needs to see the HTML output I can
get that as well.

 

Any help is appreciated.

 

Thanks,

 

Anthony

Hmm, have you tried outputting the results of $_POST['editjob']?  It might
not be set to something that evaluates to true, which would cause none of
the information you're looking for to be processed.

I'm sure you'll get plenty of comments on not directly passing a posted
variable to your query, as you're app is open to sql injection, so I'll
leave it at that.

On quick inspection, function mysql_fetch_assoc only takes one parameter...
this might be a problem. mysql_fetch_assoc

If not, you can try echoing the whole query (echo $query).. that way you'll
know what command is being passed to mysql... run it on the command line
and see if it is returning anything.

It does evaluate to true every time, as I wouldn't get to the debug echo
statement in the application.  I put it in its own script and added a few
lines, here is the test script:

 

<?php

// our global database handle

// Always get a database handle

$dbh=mysql_connect ("localhost", "root", "plasticpen5") or die ('I cannot
connect to the database because: ' . mysql_error());

mysql_select_db ("jobsdb");

 

$query = 'SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id` =1';

$result = mysql_query($query) or die("Error editing data.");

$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result, MYSQL_ASSOC);

 

echo $result."</br>";

echo "Debug data</br>";

echo "id ".$row['id']."";

 

// close our database handle

mysql_close($dbh);

?>

I gave it the id of 1 because I know it does exist in the database, this is
the output:

 

Resource id #3
Debug data
id

 

Nothing in $row and since I have never echoed a raw result ($result) from
the query can anyone explain what it might possibly be?

Hmm, have you tried outputting the results of $_POST['editjob']?  It might
not be set to something that evaluates to true, which would cause none of
the information you're looking for to be processed.

        }

 

... Rest of application.

 

Now the big problem are the three PHP statements after the "if" statement.
When I click edit job nothing appears even in the debug statement, I am not
returning a valid id from $row['id'] nor does any of the data appear in the
form(which is just an integer).  I have scrutinized the SQL query a million
times, even tried to qualify it with the database name using
`foobar`.`jobsdb` and that still not do anything.  I know the $_POST['id']
variable is passing the right id based on the echo command.  Is this a SQL
issue or a PHP issue?  I have looked at my databases in phpMyAdmin and even
checked them using the command line on our box and they have the right
permissions for the users that can access them.  If this is  a SQL issue can
you guys point me in the right direction?  I was thinking of pulling my data
base handle code and the SQL queries and just throwing them into a bare
script to see what happens.  If anyone needs to see the HTML output I can
get that as well.

 

Any help is appreciated.

 

Thanks,

 

Anthony

I would take Brian O'Connor's suggestion, first... make sure you're 
getting the expected values in $_POST. Use var_dump($_POST) to get all 
of the values.

Also, I don't know if you're already checking this or not, but given the 
SQL statement you provided your application is definitely open for SQL 
injection. If I post a value where id = [1=1;DROP TABLE jobsdb] I could 
create some massive headaches for you. Make sure you're clearly defining 
datavalues by using either prepared statements or some sort of 
mysql_real_escape function (wrapping each value in slashes in the query 
itself, too, even if it's an integer).

Ran the query from the command line this was the output:

 

mysql> SELECT * FROM `jobsdb`.`jobsdb` WHERE `id` =1;

+----+-----------+---------+----------+---------+----------------+--------+-
--------------+---------+--------+----------+---------+

| id | recruiter | jobid   | position | link    | additionalinfo | salary |
hiringmanager | company | status | postings | color   |

+----+-----------+---------+----------+---------+----------------+--------+-
--------------+---------+--------+----------+---------+

|  1 | lskdfj    | lsdkjfl | lskdjf   | slkdjfl | sldkfjsl       | lskdjf |
sldkfj        | dlskfj  | lskdjf | sldkfj   | #ff0000 |

+----+-----------+---------+----------+---------+----------------+--------+-
--------------+---------+--------+----------+---------+

1 row in set (0.00 sec)

 

It is correct since I only put in garbage data to test it.  And here is the
results of the script when I echoed the $query variable:

 

SELECT * FROM `jobsdb`.`jobsdb` WHERE `id` =1;
Resource id #3
Debug data
id

 

So I will definitely in the future keep an out for direct $_POST variables
directly in a SQL query (I will just save a local copy from now on and use
that.).

It does evaluate to true every time, as I wouldn't get to the debug echo
statement in the application.  I put it in its own script and added a few
lines, here is the test script:

 

<?php

// our global database handle

// Always get a database handle

$dbh=mysql_connect ("localhost", "root", "plasticpen5") or die ('I cannot
connect to the database because: ' . mysql_error());

mysql_select_db ("jobsdb");

 

$query = 'SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id` =1;';

$result = mysql_query($query) or die("Error editing data.");

$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result, MYSQL_ASSOC);

 

echo $result."</br>";

echo "Debug data</br>";

echo "id ".$row['id']."";

 

// close our database handle

mysql_close($dbh);

?>

I gave it the id of 1 because I know it does exist in the database, this is
the output:

 

Resource id #3
Debug data
id

 

Nothing in $row and since I have never echoed a raw result ($result) from
the query can anyone explain what it might possibly be?

Hmm, have you tried outputting the results of $_POST['editjob']?  It might
not be set to something that evaluates to true, which would cause none of
the information you're looking for to be processed.

                                "<option value='#191970'>Midnight

                                "<option value='#4169e1'>Royal
Blue</option>\n".

                                "<option value='#c71585'>Medium Violet
Red</option>\n".

                                "<option
value='#ff00ff'>Fuchsia</option>\n".

                                "</select>\n".

                                "<input name='saveedit' type='submit'
value='Save Edit'>".

                                "<input name='cancel' type='submit'
value='Cancel'>".

                                "</form>".

                        "</fieldset>\n";

        }

 

... Rest of application.

 

Now the big problem are the three PHP statements after the "if" statement.
When I click edit job nothing appears even in the debug statement, I am not
returning a valid id from $row['id'] nor does any of the data appear in the
form(which is just an integer).  I have scrutinized the SQL query a million
times, even tried to qualify it with the database name using
`foobar`.`jobsdb` and that still not do anything.  I know the $_POST['id']
variable is passing the right id based on the echo command.  Is this a SQL
issue or a PHP issue?  I have looked at my databases in phpMyAdmin and even
checked them using the command line on our box and they have the right
permissions for the users that can access them.  If this is  a SQL issue can
you guys point me in the right direction?  I was thinking of pulling my data
base handle code and the SQL queries and just throwing them into a bare
script to see what happens.  If anyone needs to see the HTML output I can
get that as well.

 

Any help is appreciated.

 

Thanks,

 

Anthony

Message-ID: <30ce306c0708141307l6150fec3gcf31b361a0583732@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

  When I try to call some javascript function for the popup window, it shows
a message(popup blocked..To see this popup click here) in IE. I dont want to
do any change in the brower settings.
The problem comes while I call the function from AJAX request. When I try
with href="javascript:popup("")", it works fine. IF any one has idea please
reply ASAP..

Thanks in advance,
 Shaiju

Try Removing the second parameter from function mysql_fetch_assoc, i.e.
take out the MYSQL_ASSOC to read $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);

TADA!  We have a winner!

The function was bogging down on the second parameter.  I think I copied the
code from an earlier project and forgot to check the function syntax and now
the echo statement is returning a 1 so we know it is right on now (also made
changes in the main application and it is correctly working).  Some things I
will work on in regards to future development are this SQL injection and
correct checking before the query is ran.

Thanks everyone!

Indeed... there's so many levels where they can get messed up -- the  
way the text was originally encoded, anything that php might do to  
it, the database column character encoding, the database client  
connection encoding, anything php might do to it again, the way  
apache serves it, the encoding specified in the html, and finally the  
browser character encoding setting.

Maybe you should publicly post a stripped down file that demonstrates  
the problem so that we can pull it down and take a look.

If you create your own csv with those characters (vs. the ones your  
user(s) have uploaded), can you reproduce the problem? [tip... on  
osx, press option-u and then u to create ? and option-u and then a to  
create ?]

Do you have the mbstring extension?  If so, what does running the  
text through mb_detect_encoding <http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ 
function.mb-detect-encoding.php> give you?

When can we all agree that the extra disk space needed for every app  
to use utf8 is worth it?  :)

No, you're missing the point. It isn't direct use of the variable from
$_POST, it's that the value might contain quotes or other characters
that can cause the database to execute SQL that you don't expect.

Use the mysql_real_escape_string() function on all values before
including them in a query:

$query = "SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id`
=".mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['id'])."";

Hello,

I just did a security audit for a site. This was a huge problem they had:

doing, "...where id = $_POST['id']"

Not only can you run sql commands you could update all the records where 
id=1 or id > 1
via SQL injection.

The larger problem they had was that all the sql was being hardcoded, no use 
of a function
anywhere. We had to go back and remove all the SQL to be called from a 
function,
then have that function do the proper validation.

They had the exact same problems w/XSS, no input validation.

Chris, nice book btw, my #1 reference for PHP Security.

Can anybody help

I am not sure if this is PHP or MySQL. I query a MySQL table

for example - $sql = "SELECT * FROM school_table WHERE class = '2005' ORDER 
BY students";

and 24 records are returned. I then want to view each record individually in 
an HTML form formatted to look like the HTML form that the data was 
originally written to the table in. This is not the problem.

The problem is how do I queue the returned records and then back each record 
individually, one by one, view, get next record and so on until all the 
returned records have been read?

save what is returned in a session, along with a total count of rows. 
redirect to a display page where you can step through the records 
with a calculated pointer to current/previous/next

Input validation?  Don't you mean output escaping?  You must not allow
uber leet usernames like |<33|>.  :)

I ran a test (just added a SQL command, harmless one in a text field) to see
what happens on SQL injection, without proper slashing or escaping
(addslashes/mysql_real_escape_string).  I like mysql_real... cause it takes
the guess work out of making the data safe.  Thanks everyone for the brief
lesson on the dangers of this (now I get to go back to all my INSERT/UPDATE
queries and add this functionality, better safe than sorry).

One example that Brian Dailey gave was with your original query

$query = "SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id` =".$_POST['id']."";

Someone could supply in $_POST['id']:

1; DROP `jobsdb`;

This could easily be transferred to:

SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id` = ".$_POST['id']."";
and $_POST['id'] could still contain 1; DROP `jobsdb`

 thus the full query would result in

SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id`=1; DROP `jobsdb`

This is my understanding however, and I could be wrong.  Any clarification
on the subject would be nice.

That would be horrendous if someone did that.  Alright all my queries get
updated then.  I didn't know that a SQL query string in PHP could contain
more than one command (I am so new to PHP/MySQL) but I guess as long as
there is a delimiter (";") any number of commands could be run, malicious or
not.

So I was doing some reading on magic quotes and wrote a simple check to see
if it is on or not.  On our box magic quotes are disabled (which is the way
I would prefer it, I would rather manually add my own slashes to sequences
that need it) but my shared hosting has magic quotes enabled.  Now I know
the admin of the shared hosting is not going to turn off magic quotes
because not everyone that uses the services are diligent programmers.

 

So let us say magic quotes are on and I have a string like so.

 

$str = "You're didn't dood it.";

 

So if that is passed to a different script in say a $_POST['str']  variable
would then the string look like "You\'re didn\'t dood it."?  Now even if
magic quotes are enabled and I use mysql_real_escape_str($_POST['str'])
would the string then look like "You\\\'re didn\\\'t dood it."?  I am just
trying to find a safe practice for every time I have to use a SQL query.

All -

Thanks for your suggestions.  We ran out of time on addressing this  
issue (technically), so we decided to "Romanize" (boooo!) the  
input.    I know, I do feel like a defeatist, but it's not my  
budget!  I did not use mb_detect_encoding, but that sounds like  
something that would help.

And the chant goes up:  UTF-8!  UTF-8!  UTF-8!

See http://us3.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.disabling.php --
you can either disable it in an .htaccess file at the web root, or you
can use get_magic_quotes_gpc() to check for it and, if on, apply
stripslashes() to input values.

The standard mysql_x() functions do not allow multiple queries, so
you're not so worried about someone injecting drop table statements.
Nevertheless, plenty of damage and/or disclosure can be performed with
just a single query.

The UN website was recently compromised due to SQL injection, by the
way, very embarassing for them.

I know this issue is no longer moot, but you can of course open a csv
file in any browser, because it is just text. The excel file, not so
much... :-)

Oh, doh.  the C in GPC stands for cookie, so yeah you can strip it off 
the cookies and request variable as well.

Why not just remove the slashes from any posted variables if it's on.
IE if you know you have a list of variables, than do the following:
|
||if (get_magic_quotes_gpc())
{
//if magic quotes is off, get rid of them!
||$str = ||stripslashes($str);
|| $str2 = ||stripslashes($str2);
|| $str3 = ||stripslashes($str3);|
|||}


||Than your assured that all your variables are magic quoteless.

You could also do the following, since these are variables, at the very top:
||
||if (get_magic_quotes_gpc())
{
//if magic quotes is off, get rid of them!
|| foreach($_GET as $key => $value)
{
|| ||$_GET[$key] = ||stripslashes($_GET[$value]);|||
||| ||$_POST[$key] = ||stripslashes($_POST[$value]);|||
| }
| |||}


Unfortunately, you can't do the same thing for $_REQUEST since it
contains cookies as well, you would have to do some extra checking there.

Also, you can minimize the following by using an htaccess file, place:
||php_value magic_quotes_gpc 0
php_value magic_quotes_runtime 0
php_value magic_quotes_sybase 0|
|
in any the htaccess file and it will disable magic quotes(if the
provider's server allows it)

Just to emphasize and elaborate on Chris's point here, a query like this:

SELECT * FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id`=1; DROP `jobsdb`

when it is sent to MySQL via mysql_query() or one of the other mysql 
functions, will NOT execute the command following the semicolon. It 
will however of course work if you are submitting it in the MySQL 
Monitor or phpMyAdmin, because it is in fact a valid MySQL 
instruction (actually, two of them).

But consider a query like this:

DELETE FROM `jobsdb` WHERE `id`=1 OR 1=1

where the 1 OR 1=1 is user input (rather than the expected 1 or 2 or 
whatever). In this case, Chris's "plenty of damage" is possibly an 
understatement, since this query will in fact be executed and all 
rows will be deleted.  In a case like this, you need to be checking 
that your user is entering an expected kind of value, that is (in 
this case), an integer, with the is_int() function, or (in other 
cases) however you can.

The point is that you can't just rely on mysql_real_escape_string for 
protection.

My recommendation is to use the following lines in the .htaccess file of
your web root:

	php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
	php_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
	php_flag magic_quotes_sybase off

Then use the function shown in the relevant PHundamentals article
[http://www.nyphp.org/phundamentals/storingretrieving.php] at the
beginning of your core php file which will detect and correct the
settings if the .htaccess is accidentally mangled/deleted or if you run
the code on a server that doesn't honor the .htaccess (very rare).

I think the function arrray_walk_recursive, and array_map are very
useful for dealing with escaping.  For instance:

if(get_magic_quotes_gpc()) {
array_walk_recursive($_POST,"stripslashes");
array_walk_recursive($_GET,"stripslashes");
array_walk_recursive($_COOKIE,"stripslashes");
}

You also probably don't want to load up your code with
"mysql_real_escape_string()," so here is an alternative.  This is a
good method for fixing bad code because it can be implemented without
a major rewrite.

$sql  = prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='%s' AND
password='%s' ",$POST['username'],$POST['password']);

function prepare() {
  $args_array = func_get_args();
  for ($i=1;$i<count($args_array);$i++) {
    $args_array[$i] = mysql_real_escape_string($args_array[$i]);
  }
  return call_user_func_array("sprintf",$args_array);
}

are any number of venues you can use for this.

2. When starting a new topic please don't do so by replying to an

It seems to me that this is a new topic... at least it shows up

Some email programs dont thread properly: for example, Pine will thread by 
Subject rather than looking at messages ids. Mutt is the same unless you 
switch in strict_threads. So it depends on your mail reader...

The OT post was created by opening a reply to a message posted on
12/8/2006 by Anirudh Zala on an unrelated topic, then deleting the
subject and all content.  Sadly, this does not clear out the References
and In-Reply-To headers shown above.

While there are no doubt many clients and applications which are not
affected by these headers, the fact is that many modern mail clients (eg
Thunderbird) do use them to track conversations though the subject may
change, as well as following individual threads within a conversation.

The simple fix is to create a new message when you are creating a new
thread, rather than trying to 'recycle' an old one.

Always happy to help ;)  My apologies for the somewhat terse reply.

Hopefully this thread can now progress into a PHP-related discussion on
the use of References and In-Reply-To headers when sending mail from PHP.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Need Help Using SOAP with PHP 4...
Message-ID: <47f4c4570708151145s4eb2ffc6u6b2ef00f5d849171@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

  I am very new to the concept of SOAP. Yesterday I bought a book of Amazon
on PHP Web Services and today my ATG/JSP savvy project manger asked me to
write a SOAP request using PHP :)  The PHP program needs to grab an XML file
(generated by a JAR file on an APP servlet ) via a POST method; then the
program I need to write will pass the XML information via a post method to
another application on our server.
Since we mainly deal with JSP. I'm working with PHP 4.3 and it doesn't look
like my job will upgrade to PHP 5 anytime in the future. I'm currently
looking into NuSoap as I write this email, but any other suggestions or
tutorial links will be highly appreciated.
p.s.
     PEAR isn't an option in this particular scenario :(

Of course, Im not disagreeing with you.

Also, quoting just enough to make context clear (like here) helps - most 
people are too lazy to do that.

Oh, and bottom posting too (yes, I know Gmail top posts by default - I can 
only assume it was written by younger programmers that dont know any 
better ;-)

Chris:

Very interesting. You have a habit of pointing me in the right direction.
The log files haven't changes since the problem appeared, meaning that
Apache never started. BUT...I realize I have never looked at my log files
before and the access log was 35Mbytes! So...what do we do with log files?
How do we flush them? Cron? Probably time to learn a bit about Apache
management...or should I let my ISP worry abut that?

Digging deeper, the Xampp gui console beautifully hides the problem.
Starting Apache from the command line made the problem obvious. I simply
commented out the following lines in the httpf.conf file and everything is
fine now.

#LoadModule dav_svn_module "C:/Program Files/Subversion/bin/mod_dav_svn.so"
#LoadModule authz_svn_module "C:/Program
Files/Subversion/bin/mod_authz_svn.so"

Life is good again.... And next week this Bostonian will code in Amagansett
-- life gets better. Of course, no coding in Amagansett would be even
better.

Tom,

When you top post like this, you ruin the flow of the text, as the
thread of conversation begins somewhere in the middle,goes down, jumps
back up to somewhere else, goes down again, jumps to the top of the text
and back down again.

Your ISP should already be setup to use logrotate (a cron job for the  
purpose) ...

http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/117

BTW, on the topic, Im about to upgrade a box and have been looking if  
its possible to "merge" those logs across machines so they will show  
up in stat reports.  The new box will start w/ fresh logs, Im  
wondering if just renaming the logs w/ hostname will do ...

I use cronolog and configure Apache to pipe into it.
http://cronolog.org/

This gives me log files with datestamp in the filename (so, one log file 
per day) and no rotation needed at all.

Elliotte,

It seems your review of XML databases has picked up a lot of comments. 
It's doing well on the social bookmarking circuit too.
http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/the-state-of-native-xml-databases/

The topic in general seems to be garnering a lot of interest lately. Would 
you be willing to do a presentation this fall on the state of XML 
databases [in general|for PHP developers].   Maybe some comments on where 
the Zend Framework XML Content Store/Zend_Db_Xml fits in?


List,

If anyone else has suggestions for an October or November meeting topic 
please let us know, I know there was some talk on presentation topics 
earlier this summer but I can't seem to find it at the moment.

My time is extremely constrained, but I can probably fit something in 
since you're local. I should warn you though that I don't actually know 
squat about the Zend Framework XML Content Store/Zend_Db_Xml (not that 
that's ever stopped me from spouting off at the mouth before :-)

Hey everyone

I am about to move, and considering dumping Speakeasy DSL for the sake of
economy, and because the installation (involving Verizon, Covad) is a total
f$@#ing nightmare.

Does anyone care to share an opinion about Comcast? How's the speed and
reliability? Have you been able to work around the dynamic IP and expose ssh
and http to the world? (I know there are ways. e.g,. with dyndyns.org, but
I'd be interested in knowing how well it works).

Thanks!

I didn't know OT was a crime, if you prepend your subject with  [OT]. If it
is, I am guilty but I still would like to know what anybody thinks of
Comcast's internet service (-:

I thought top-posting was preferred because there's a presumption that you
start by reading post 1. Post 2 replies to post 1 so let's get right to the
reply rather than scrolling through screens of crap that -- now, my pet
peeve -- a lot of people are too lazy to snip, and which you have (probably)
already read.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Eliminating namespace conflicts between scripts?
Message-ID: <C2E99F6A.6E33%cliff@pinestream.com>

I am tying a large open source ap into my main ap. This ap has numerous
global variable and countless includes and classless functions. Thus, the
chances for a namespace conflict with my primary application are high.

Yet it needs to be tightly coupled with my ap. What do you suggest for
achieving this? The safest approach might be to use curl, although it seems
a bit silly to curl into your own project. And its probably slow, although I
can cache the result so performance shouldn?t be an issue.

Thoughts?

Well, that's part of what classes are for, to manage namespaces. Since
you are probably not going to redo the open source app to use classes,
you'll have to minimize the name spaces your app uses. Although you
may just want to resolve conflicts as they come up.

You can put all your global variables into a single global variable
that can be an associative array. Then you are using only 1 global
name.
So this:
$var1 = 'xyz';
$var2 = 'abc';

becomes:
$myvars['var1'] = 'xyz';
$myvars['var2'] = 'abc';

You can put your functions into a class (or classes) and reference the
class "statically", so you just need to prefix your functions with the
class name. Statically referencing the function will give global scope
without having to declare global variables.
class MyFuncs {
function a {}
function b{}
...
}

To call function "a" you would change a() to MyFuncs::a();

Those are some ideas. Curl will add a lot of overhead, but I admit I
have gone that route before.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Search of directories and files on my web server
Message-ID: <E38C4247-721C-4260-8424-56A16CE0DBEF@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

I am working on a little script that will start at a specified  
directory on my web server and then proceed to look through all files  
and sub-folders for an instance of text located in a file.  (This is  
a follow-up of sorts to a previous post of mine from a week or two ago.)

I got the code to work fine for searching through one directory.   
However, my thought was that in order to drill down through an  
undefined number of sub-folders I would need to implement a recursive  
function.  The recursive "depth first" search function I made is not  
working as expected and so far I haven't been able to figure out what  
or how I need to tweak it.

I'm completely squeezed for time at work so I'll continue to bang  
away at it but I thought I would post it here in the hopes that some  
of our rockets scientists can show me the error of my ways.  I'm  
guessing this will be a rather simple problem for some folks on the  
list.

So here goes.  Listed below are my algorithm and code.  I'm looking  
forward to finding out where I'm going wrong.  =)

My algorithm:
1) Set the directory that the script will start in.
2) Open that directory and read all files and folders in that directory.
3) While each item is being read, check it.  If the item is a  
directory, call the recursive search in order to drill down further.   
If the item is a file, open the file and search for the text string  
that I am trying to locate.

My code (with comments):

<?php
$path='/home/usr/account';
search($path);
	
function search($path)
{
	$dir=opendir($path);
	// browse all files and folders in the current directory
	while (false !== ($item=readdir($dir))) {
		// if the item is a directory, drill down using a recursive call to  
the search function
		if (is_dir($item) && $item !='.' && $item!='..') {
			search($path . '/' . $item);
		}
		if (is_file($item)) {
			$file=file($item);
			$lines=count($file);
			for ($i=0; $i<$lines; $i++) {
				if (strstr(($file[$i]), 'text to search for')) {
					echo 'Search string found on line ' . $i . ' in file ' . $path .  
'/' . $item . '<br />';
				}
			}
		}
	}
	closedir($dir);
}
?>

That's a lot of work...and testing. I probably have less than a dozen global
variables and functions in my app, but there's always "but".... A curl call
every hour or so...or even once a day with good caching seems so much easier
and safer.

What about issuing a command line call? Although opening up this
functionality adds so many security risks.

Until we have a real choice in local telephone providers, ALL DSL

it.

Even with dyndns setups, I wouldn't be suprised if there's some other

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XML Manipulation
Message-ID: <016701c7e012$8f8f8810$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello all, 

After the XML vs SQL conversation, I started to rethink a product I'm working on.
I had been having a lot of trouble modeling the data into SQL. It was starting to 
look very complicated.

So, I decided I would try to store it in XML. The data I am storing is messages w/in a thread,
timestamp, body and subject. On the SQL side, we create a table that has the user id, 
and a row per message/thread which contains a path to the xml file.

The reason XML seemed better is that I store the data top down and that is the true
order of the thread. Messages within the thread can come from email or html page response,
so its important to insert items into the thread via the timestamp. Using XML just made it 
simpler for me to wrap my head around, than trying to model it in SQL.

Anyways, my question is about which XML parser package to use.

I'm sure PEAR has one, and I like PEAR stuff. I'm sure PHP Classes has something as well.
Maybe YOU have a library that's open source.

What are some pros/cons of XML parser librarys. I'll need to read and write XML, plus easily
convert the xml into php arrays so I can manipulate them in PHP.

My codebase is OOP 5, so I'm willing to extend an existing class if need be.

Thanks!

Disregard, 

I thought you meant file browser, not a search script to parse through the
directories.  But maybe this will apply in the while look to discern
directories from files.

Sorry for any confusion.

Aaron,

First up, why not just use grep?

Anyway, your problem is that you are not addressing the items by the
full path, so the script can't find them.

Here is a modified example which may help, and includes some output so
you can see what is haoppening.

Dan

<?php

$path='.';
search($path);

function search($path)
{
    echo 'Searching '. $path ."\n";
    $dir=opendir($path);
    // browse all files and folders in the current directory
    while (false !== ($item=readdir($dir))) {
        if ($item == '.' | $item == '..') {
                continue;
        }

        $item = $path .'/'. $item;

        echo $item."\n";
        // if the item is a directory, drill down using a
        // recursive call to the search function
        if (is_dir($item) && $item !='.' && $item!='..') {
            search($item);
        }
        if (is_file($item)) {
            $file=file($item);
            $lines=count($file);
            for ($i=0; $i<$lines; $i++) {
                if (strstr(($file[$i]), 'text to search for')) {
                    echo 'Search string found on line ' . $i
                        . ' in file ' . $item . '<br />';
                }
            }
        }
    }
    closedir($dir);
    echo 'Done searching '. $path ."\n";
}

// end of script

This sounds awfully messy to me, and will most likely be very slow.

I'm all for XML, but this kind of thing is what databases are meant for.

All you need are 2 tables, one for each thread and one for messages.

threads:

thread_id,subject,ts,activity

messages:

msg_id,thread_id,user_id,ts,subject,body

SQL:

SELECT * FROM threads ORDER BY activity DESC

SELECT * FROM messages WHERE thread_id=? ORDER BY ts ASC

Couldn't be easier, if you want to store extra data about each thread or
message just add fields to the relevant table.

I just wrapped up a complete rewrite of a system that used one table for
threads and messages, and I would strongly suggest advise against it.

If you're looking for ideas, here is a proof-of-concept I put together
back in 2004 for a system using a modified preorder traversal tree for
threaded messages.

Which is the crux of the problem: if you're too lazy to snip then you're 
more likely to top-post because your reply will get lost at the bottom 
after a few emails have been exchanged.

This is also why (laziness) people still use Outlook and IE7 :-)

Which is the crux of the problem: if you're too lazy to snip then you're 
more likely to top-post because your reply will get lost at the bottom 
after a few emails have been exchanged.

This is also why (laziness) people still use Outlook and IE7 :-)

I'm considering moving away from Speakeasy for the same reason - I had  
an outage recently, caused by a Verizon problem, and it was a minor  
miracle that it only lasted three days.

I don't know if you can get RCN where you are, but they sell static  
IPs as an add-on to residential accounts, which comes with all ports  
being unblocked. If you're stuck with Comcast, they have recently  
dropped prices on their commercial packages (at least according to the  
sales person I got a quote and contract from; their website still says  
$95/month but I was quoted $65 with a static IP). They're happy to  
sell commercial service to a residence (as a "home office" package)  
and commercial service has no port blocking.

I'm with David Mintz, on this one and, at best, this posting argument
strikes me as a preference, rather than an absolute. Granted, it may be a
community preference here, and if so, should be heeded, but it seems silly
to argue in terms of "right" and "wrong."

Reasonable people may also differ on how much context or content is
relevant.

I notice an off-thread subject line here, too. Should this be scolded, too?

Dan, thanks that did the trick.  I had various echo statements in my  
original script but took them out for purposes of posting succinct  
code to the list.

I didn't use grep because I don't have any exposure or experience  
with it.  It was mentioned as an option during my original post but I  
was hesitant to try the unknown path given the duress I was under  
from time constraints.

Any suggestions for a good grep tutorial/resource on the web?  I'm  
interested in adding it to my tool belt for future use.

In going back and looking at the one or two grep examples, it seems  
that it might be a much simpler and more efficient way of solving  
this problem.

Cheers,

-Aaron

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Login schemes.
Message-ID: <000e01c7e02d$b147eea0$13d7cbe0$@com>

I was thinking about login schemes so I had an idea about using a form on
the front page which would authenticate against a database (already done
this part) but I am having problems getting people to the members/lobby
area.  One way of doing it is to use the $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] variable and
when index.php calls itself the checks for cookie data would tell them that
they have successfully logged in and maybe use an include statement.  The
other alternative is that as soon as the checks against the SQL database are
complete I could use a header ("Location: ./foobar.php") statement to move
them to the right page and then pull data based on the user id that is
stored in a session/cookie, but the problem is that once I send a HTML
header (stylesheets for the form) I can't use the header function as it
burps an error.

 

How do you guys handle events like this?

I was thinking that might be reasonable and avoids the http  
connection overhead.  As long as the call is totally controlled by  
you and doesn't include user input, I don't see any security risks.   
Does the other app need access to your web server environment - aka  
$_SERVER?  If so, that would throw out both options and you'd have to  
figure out how to rework your app to play nice with it.

FYI, an old version of one of our apps used curl to tickle a mail  
queue every 5 minutes and worked fine.

Output buffering. It's fantastic. http://us3.php.net/ob_start
You can change the headers anywhere you like in your script, and not have to
worry about it tossing errors.

Why does access to $_SERVER matter for call originating from call? Curl is
just simulating a http request.

I would like to +1 the RCN mention. I did have some trouble with them
installing an unrequested cable television set, but once we got that
worked out I've not much had much of a problem with them.

I can't speak about hosting, though, as I don't host anything
business-wise from the RCN line.

The right solution is to *always* process POST data before sending any
data back to the user.   Why not just move the form processing code to
the top of the script? There is no reason that you need to send the
html head section before you do something with the POST data.

What I meant is if the other app needed access to the user's cookies,  
ip, user agent, etc.  Sorry, I didn't really phrase it very well.

If your new place has access to Verizon FiOS, I'd recommend that.   
It's so fast!!  A friend of mine runs a server successfully through  
it using dyndns.org.

Ah, got it. I like the curl idea for starters. It's a really clean
separation of applications and sure beats spending time looking for
conflicts.

One other though for those following, although a different usage model, is
an iframe.

Since I am from the old school I always think of applications a driven event
model.  I guess all form processing can happen at the top and then the
header information can be thrown at the user after.

Message-ID: <74236455-71C3-4B2A-A9CD-20450A7A7078@jonbaer.com>

So the two tools I have come to respect in Ruby world are both Rspec  
and Rcov and am looking for what the equivalents in PHP and notice  
there is a nice "documentation coverage" page on PEAR now ...

http://pear.php.net/package/QA_Peardoc_Coverage

So what would be used for BDD in PHP (in terms of what Rspec does)  
and what tool would do something like a QA_Test_Coverage type of  
analysis into PHP code?

Im starting to refactor some old code in a project and moving  
everything into a PEAR package + would like to include these 2 ideas ...

...

Don't forget that since you're not doing a chdir() before recursing that 
you're still looking at files in the context of your original working 
directory.

Change it to:

         $filepath = "${path}/${item}";
         if (is_file($filepath)) {
             $file=file($filepath);

and it should work.

The "Create Patch" menu option in Tortoise.  It will run and then let you 
save the output to a file or copy it to the clipboard.

So, why not add a prefix to your functions and global variable names?  
Search, replace, fixed.

Hi All - I'm working through an installation of PHP-GTK2 on Windows XP
system.  Everything's going OK up to the install of pecl bcompiler and
pdflib packages.  When I install either of these I get the following:
 
$>pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/bcompiler-0.8

Starting to download bcompiler-0.8.tgz (46,667 bytes)
.........done: 46,667 bytes
10 source files, building
running: msdev bcompiler.dsp /MAKE "bcompiler - Release"
ERROR: There were errors during compilation.
 
The pdflib similarly bombs after the /MAKE command.
 
All help is appreciated.  Small words and short sentences work best.
Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Good Crediting Practices
Message-ID: <46C5A182.1090506@beezifies.com>

I'm planning on some major rewrites to an existing GPL application.

I'd say that of the application, I will be extending, enhancing, or 
changing between 30 and 60 % of the application, including the program 
name for compatible reasons(the two modules must be able to be run in 
the same master program simultaneously, so a lot of classes and 
functions need to be changed to differentiate them)

What is the best way to note my code and provide the proper credit?

The current header has the program name, filename, version, and 
identifcation information of the current author(all GPL).

My own tendency would be to place my header underneath the existing one, 
however the version information would be different, so I want to give 
prominent credit to the original author, while still maintaining 
identification information.

The current header is as follows:
//
// Copyright (C) 2006 Thomas Papin
// http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU/GPL

// This file is part of the AdsManager Component,
// a Joomla! Classifieds Component by Thomas Papin
// Email: thomas.papin at free.fr
//

I'm thinking the best course would be:

// Adsmanager Extended
// Based on:
//--------------
//
// Copyright (C) 2006 Thomas Papin
// http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU/GPL
// This file is part of the AdsManager Component,
// a Joomla! Classifieds Component by Thomas Papin
// Email: thomas.papin at free.fr
//--------------
// Changes and Extentions
// Copyright (C) 2007 Gary Mort
// http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU/GPL
// This file extends and enhances the AdsManager Component,
// it can be installed stand alone, or alongside AdsManager


But that looks confusing to me.  Should I just stick all my new text 
below the existing notice?

Obviously, throughout the program I can mark my changes to the code 
where appropriate.

Just wondering what is considered best/common practice.

30-60% is pretty major. As far as credit goes, the GPL basically says
that you shouldn't try to pass off your work as the original
author's--to protect the author in case your modifications break
something.

You have a responsibility to provide credit and a link back to the
original project, but the copyright belongs to you (or your employer)
alone.

**/

Personally, I would also stick a NO WARRANTY clause in there, but
technically that's part of the GPL.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Cache package suggestions
Message-ID: <C2EB20A1.6F0E%cliff@pinestream.com>

I?m reviewing caching packages and am looking for suggestions. If you have
seen one of my prior threads, I just want to cache the results of a curl
operation, since that?s very slow. My choices so far seem to be:

Smarty cache ? since I use Smarty anyway. I?ll probably use Smarty cache for
general page result caching, but perhaps not for lower layer objects?
PEAR cachelite ? looks simple and efficient. Could be good for caching small
?widgets?, misc paramters, etc.
ZendFramework Zend_Cache ? multiple backend storage options is nice, but may
be overkill for my needs ? until I realize I need memcached of course.
Ez components cache class -- unknown
Others?

Also... All packages generally store cache results based on a lifetime. But
what if I want to store results using a date, not a lifetime. An example
would be something that changes once per day. Ideally, I?d like this updated
for the first hit after midnight each day. Suggestions?

Message-ID: <241777.64891.qm@web35611.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Does this sound unreasonable, or is it just me?

In order to upload files to the website, I have to do this:

1. Use WinSCP to log in to the server as myself and transfer files from my PC to my home directory on the server.

2. Use PuTTY to log in to the server as myself, then su as root, and from the command line move the files from my home directory to the website's  directory.

Seems like a very tedious process to update files, especially when you're modifying files in this subdirectory and that subdirectory.

It's set up this way for security -- no ftp access and no logging in as root.

I swear, I was only going to change one little thing.  Well, ok, maybe 
2.. 3....4...and why is this program passing large table results to

I use Eclipse to upload to a staging folder and then move them using a SSH
session as well.  Not absurd but is tedious.

Does this sound unreasonable, or is it just me?

In order to upload files to the website, I have to do this:

1. Use WinSCP to log in to the server as myself and transfer files from my
PC to my home directory on the server.

2. Use PuTTY to log in to the server as myself, then su as root, and from
the command line move the files from my home directory to the website's
directory.

Seems like a very tedious process to update files, especially when you're
modifying files in this subdirectory and that subdirectory.

It's set up this way for security -- no ftp access and no logging in as
root.

In projects directory on your workstation:

$ svn commit -m "Important bugfixes" myproject

Now ssh to webserver:

$ su -
# cd /usr/local/myproject
# svn up

The part about no ftp access and no root login is not unreasonable,
it's standard practice for many production systems. The part where you
move files around rather than using version control is a recipe for
disaster.

Couldn't agree more.  Consider looking into Bazaar (distributed version 
control).  Once you've set it up on your desktop and server, you can:

$ bzr -ci -m "Important bugfixes"
$ bzr push
// which will use your 'remembered' sftp address

// and then on the server,
# bzr pull
// which grabs the latest from the 'remembered' home directory

Bazaar: http://bazaar-vcs.org/

Can your userid have access to the web site's directory?  You can then use
WinSCP to copy the files there directly, and avoid using PuTTY.

updating a web site should not require root 

but, since you do have root on the server, you can do this: 

1. if your site is not owned by a dedicated user + group, I would
recommend setting it up; it is easy to do.  Start by creating a
non-system user & group (this varies with different OSes), on most
linux distros this should do it: 

$ sudo useradd -d /var/www/example.com example

then: 

$ sudo chown -R example:example /var/www/example.com 

i don't give my site users (e.g. "example") passwords, they have no need
to log in interactively.  the -d flag to useradd sets the directory to
use for the user's $HOME, and the -R flag to the chmod command
recursively sets owner:group properties of all files & directories below
the path specified 


2. add yourself to the website user's primary group

$ sudo vi /etc/group 

add your username to the "example" group:

example:x:1001:donna 


3. make sure your website files are group writeable 

$ sudo find /var/www/example.com -type d -exec chmod 2775 '{}' \; 
$ sudo find /var/www/example.com -type f -exec chmod 0664 '{}' \; 

the first command recursively makes all directories group writable, and
traversable + readable by everyone (incl. the user your apache runs as),
and sets the "sticky group" bit, I think it's called, so new files and
directories will be owned by the containing directory's gid (rather than
the gid of the user doing the writing) 

the second command recursively makes all files group writable and
readable by everyone.  if you have any command line or cgi scripts which
need to be executable, you will have to restore the -x bit

$ sudo chmod 0775 /var/www/example.com/scripts/myscript.pl 

note all users with an account on the machine will be able to read the
files as well, but since apache must have access in any case, there's
really no way around that; at least for the files that make up your
site.  for files apache does not need access to, replace the last bit
with zero in any of the octets above

$ sudo chmod 2770 /var/www/example.com/privatedir 


3. you can now upload directly to the file's final destination.  you can
create a symlink from your $HOME to the site's root directory if it makes 
it easier 

$ cd && ln -s /var/www/example.com 

you now also have a mechanism in place to allow other developers to
update the site without giving away root: just add them to the group 


finally, I agree with Chris that anybody doing serious work should be
using version control, but that is the next step, first you should have
your file permissions in order , and a reasonably good understanding of
what the commands above do, and why you want to do it.  also, use sudo. 

hth, 
kenneth

Another way to do essentially the same noted above:
Have your administrator add you to the group for the web root directory, in
my case the apache group, as well as g+w perms. Add the line 'newgrp apache'
to your profile and presto, permissions to move and delete files around.

Both of these are file based, so you have some disk i/o overhead.   
I've used both.  Smarty is oriented a bit more towards page output  
caching, but I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to store  
anything else... you just need to appropriately serialize the data to  
a string.  Cache_Lite has more methods for dealing with other types  
of data.

This one gets my vote because of the multiple backend options - APC,  
Memcache, ZendPlatform, SQLite, and file based.  Only SQLite and file- 
based backends support the "tag" grouping - but it's not that  
important a feature. I would say don't use tagging so you can easily  
switch the backends.  Also, I don't really see how it's anymore  
overkill than PEAR.  You don't need to include the whole framework as  
demonstrated in this article.

Use a lifetime of 86400 and manually invalidate it sometime after  
midnight.  It's not reliable that it would stay always at the same  
time.  You could set no expire time for the cache (or a really huge  
expire time if your cache system requires an expiration) and then  
have a cron process that runs after midnight and updates the cache  
programmatically.  That's probably better.

The Clew meme dates back to 2003, when NYPHP was experimenting with
ways to re-implement Mailman as an OO-PHP solution. There's an
overview at http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/nyphp/, but
very little interest remained after that presentation, and we all went
on to do other things.

The nice thing about using some sort of tree (we called it a
nested-set model) for messages is that you get true threading--this is
a reply to that--rather than just a flat chronological list of
replies.

Very often, people just want the flat list as it is easier to follow.

Great suggestions. Time to dig more deeply into ZendCache. Another
suggestion I received offline regarding the midnight issue is to dynamically
calculate the lifetime to midnight for each request. But this does add some
calculation overhead for each request.

Nested-set grows rather hairy in no time, especially with data that 
needs to be changed often.  After some reading (thanks to Elliotte's 
compass - thank you sir), it seems to me XML could definitely prove a 
better means of tracking hierarchal information, which especially 
includes threaded conversation.  It seems to me that flattening tree 
data is far easier than branching flat data (and meta fields in my rel 
db makes me queasy).

A common solution to this class of problem, is to only run the routine
if the request draws the unlucky lottery number... for example the
default PHP session garbage collection routine operates like:

if(rand(0,100) == 42) {
cleanup_expired_sessions();
}

How about setting the cache lifetime for each request to:
  mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m"), date("d")+1, date("Y")) - time();

Let us talk about theoretical here.  If the owner of the web root folder is
"root" (/var/www/html), should it be changed to the Apache group that is
created normally.  I did a few checks in the /etc/group file and the apache
group does exist as well my account on the box is part of that group, should
the web root group be changed apache to make sure that only users of the
Apache group have controls?

Another way to do essentially the same noted above:
Have your administrator add you to the group for the web root directory, in
my case the apache group, as well as g+w perms. Add the line 'newgrp apache'
to your profile and presto, permissions to move and delete files around.

What is generally called "adjacent pair" is easiest, thats the  
record_id, record_id_parent scenario you see in many places.

The bit of SQL you need to make it child's play is the "WITH RECURSE" 
feature, which is sadly not widely supported:

SELECT record_id, text_of_message
   FROM messages  chd
   JOIN messages par  ON chd.record_id_par = par.record_id WITH RECURSE
  WHERE chd.record_id = $x

This construct does the Right Thing.  But as I said, it is almost 
completely unsupported.  It is a true black eye IMHO that nearly all big 
dbms vendors have ignored this incredibly useful extension.

Also, don't confuse the nature of the data with its presentation.  In 
terms of structure, all messaging systems are storing the same 
structure, be it emails, blogs with responses, usenet, or message 
boards.  All of them are storing a root message with replies and 
replies-to-replies and so forth.  It is a //hierarchy of like items//. 

It terms of presentation you can go treeview, flattened (i think phpbb 
does that), or indented (like some blogging systems), but the matter of 
presentation can even be made a user option and its child's play to 
support any presentation if the data is structured well to begin with.

The best way to decide between files (as in XML, JSON, or YAML or 
plaintext) and table-based dbms is overhead.  How much down payment do 
you have to make to get the result?

The Oracle alternative is CONNECT BY/START WITH.  PostgreSQL has a 
similar package in contribs/tablefunc.

Here's a PostgreSQL stored procedure I used to dump a pre-order twalk 
trace of a tree-structured message base.

Message-ID: <d953ccea0708171452q16b53acdh90426da783079cd6@mail.gmail.com>

I am having issues with encryption/decryption.

I am attempting to encrypt an integer (61663)

when i decrypt it I get the following appended to my decrypted value.

61663\357\277\275\357\277\275\357\277\275

$td = mcrypt_module_open('blowfish', '', 'cbc, '');
 $iv = mcrypt_create_iv (mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size($td), MCRYPT_RAND);
    mcrypt_generic_init($td, $key, $iv);
    $decrypted_data = mdecrypt_generic($td, base64_decode($input));


BTW I base 64 encode the encypted integer(61663) and store it in a cookie

Any Help would be greatly appreciated

Thanks,

Sean

generally, you only want the apache user to have read access to your
files, and read + traverse (execute) access to your directories, the
exception is cgi scripts & the like, where it also needs +x on files

i tend to leave /var/www/html alone because if you use a package
manager, it will think it owns it (it is where it puts the
"congratulations, apache works!" page).  in my /var/www root also owns
the default webalizer directory & a bunch of other installed apps 

for user-installed sites, i always use VirtualHosts, and i always create
a custom user and group to own them, for the access control benefits i
described.  most distros make this easy by including /etc/httpd/conf.d/*
from the system-installed httpd.conf

That's certainly true. The performance issues are also real though. What 
you need is the best of both worlds: a database that stores XML. Neither 
a SQL database nor XML in a file system is optimal for this problem. Of 
course, you can make both work and people have indeed done so, but why 
not get the best of both worlds?

The problem is this essentially a current research project. While both 
XMl and SQL are proven technologies, using a native XML database 
integrated with PHP would be blazing new territory. You need to decide 
whether you're ready to take on that task or not.

I can see two potential problems:

You need to use the same initialization vector (IV) to decrypt as you
did to encrypt. Typically, after encryption, you prepend the iv to the
ciphertext value and store the whole thing (iv+encrypted). When you're
ready to decrypt, you chop the iv off the front and use it to decrypt
the ciphertext.

Second, how are you generating the key? Is it a multiple of 32 characters long?

There's a nifty little class that will do this for you in the source

Are there any issues related to having the version control hidden files and
folders on a production site? Does the Subversion .svn folder need to be
protected on a production site? Is the best practice to do ongoing updates
on a production site using version control or to export  specific tagged
versions to a production site (which would remove al the version control
specific hidden files)?

That's good.

I saw this on programming.reddit.com and wondered if the NYPHP mailing
list had any thoughts on the subject.

Particularly:
"The mailing lists were never easy to read through but if a man put
his mind to it and used the delete button swiftly enough you could
actually get something out of them and maybe even find a reason to
stay on. But ever since everybody in North America cheaped out and
started sending all the work to India the mailing lists of every major
product have been polluted with the Sanjays and Prashants of this
world asking questions that make me wonder why the he[ck] we're
sending out our prized projects to these seemingly incompetent
people."

http://arsenalist.com/2007/08/14/outsourcing-is-killing-it/

There are a lot of over-generalizations made by this blogger, but some
of what he says is true (at least, in 100% of the mailing lists I'm
subscribed to, especially PHP-related lists).

Reddit thread:
http://programming.reddit.com/info/2gjux/comments

I know I myself have been slightly frustrated by the volume of mail on
the NYPHP list that makes me wonder if the submitter even bothered to
make a trip to Google before asking questions on the list.

Message-ID: <304698.85007.qm@web90601.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have a project coming up that I will be running on IIS with MS Sql.  Orginally, it was going to run on linux with apache and mysql, but as things go, that changed.

So I will still be using Pear::MDB2 and Pear::Auth .The DB will be mssql on a seperate machine.  

My question is:
Is anyone familiar with how to create an encrypted connection string while using MDB2 while connecting to the db?

I have been using mdb2 for a while on linux, but havent used IIS too often.

Any feedback or suggestions would be great.

Thank you.
Bill

In general, it is considered bad form to have your web root the same as your
repository sandbox. If you break something and have to revert, what happens
to your production site? If you can, separate them.

Hi Cliff, 

I would never release a production site as a working directory;  I only
agree that version control is important for serious projects.  I do
check out my dev sites as working directories, and typically set up cvs
to trigger an update of the dev site for every commit

for moving to testing & production, I use shell scripts which operate on
specifically tagged versions & perform an export, like you describe 

Kenneth

Ah, got it. That's what I figured, but I wanted to be sure. The working
directory "trick" for updating a production site sounds so easy, but it
makes me queasy. Exporting specific tagged releases sounds much more
controlled. Now I just need to write some Subversion export shell
scripts....

I honestly don't see much difference between this and when students 
would flood a list with questions when their final projects where due.  
Nor was there much difference between this and the late spring/summer 
flood of new graduates trying to figure out what their doing.


It is slightly worse in that due to poor english skills, you have a much 
lower percentage of noobs who actually will graduate to supplying 
advice.  OTOH, maybe they go off and do so on their own lists.

Unfortunately the author "Dynamic Ink" has decided that his code (an
adaptation of a UPS copyrighted API open to registered users) is only
available via a pay for article on PHP | Architect. Obviously this is
his choice to make but goes against the spirit of open help of this
list.

I did purchase the articles in question as I needed the code as a
reference to complete a project at work. The articles are available as a
back copy on the PHP | Architect web site.

I would post my code adaptation, but I am unfamiliar with the legal
implications of doing so. At best it's a gray area as the code doesn't
work without the copyrighted API.

I appreciate the help that I received (even though  had to pay for it)
when I asked the same question, but I would call upon future posters to
post the code examples they reference or refrain from "advertising" on
this list. This was obviously a blatant plug to get PHP | Architect
subscription money that the author most likely received a royalty from,
and this list didn't get any part of that revenue despite that it
enabled any purchases that may have been made as a result of my post or
this post.

I'm guessing others feel as I do about this issue, and I respect anyone
else's opinion who may disagree.

Just my $.02

Cheers,

Tim Boyden

Hello Aaron,

I convert .xls files to .csv files and then do parsing/manipulation.

I can include source if you want it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Htaccess question for blocking directories
Message-ID: <C2EF2B98.6FEF%cliff@pinestream.com>

I have been researching various method for blocking directories and dir
listings. Many versions seem to be implemented poorly or just overkill,
using fancy rewrites and performance killing regex for everything.

Can anyone tell me if there are any issues with my solution:

1. Use ?Deny from all? for the dir to be protected. In local .htaccess or
higher level .htaccess for better performance.
2. Place ErrorDocument 403 http://lwww.domainnam.com in a root-level (or
other appropriate level) .htaccess file.

No need for Rewrites, Rewritematches, index.php files in every folder, etc.

This blocks the directory while taking care of the ugly 403 message. A
redirect to the home page seems reasonable. But are there any SEO, etc.
issues?

Cliff

Hello Aaron,

Yes, I'm doing the conversion in php, calling the CL utility xls2csv and 
taking
its output and writing it to file.

Code included. I removed my processing on the data, since I don't know what 
you want
to do with it. This partial script goes through each file in the target 
director and converts from
.xls to /converted/.csv

You can do as you please after. Its got libs that aren't open source though.
If you need access to particular function calls or classes, let me know.

So, yeah, this script isn't of much use to you I guess. Sorry.

Timothy,

I am sorry that you feel unhappy for having to pay a few dollars for an
article that successfully solved your issue. Considering that you appear to
be employed (at SuperCoups) and the typical hourly PHP wage is well over
$30, if this article saved you 18 minutes of effort seeking a solution then
you have made a fine investment ($8.78/($30/60) = 17.56 minutes).

If a magazine publishes your work it is unethical to then give the article
away for free. You should know that I do not receive royalties; you asked
for assistance with a topic and so I let you know that the solution existed
in the article. In the future if you seek support and then accept the help,
please refrain from then ranting negatively about the means in which it was
given.

Unfortunately the author "Dynamic Ink" has decided that his code (an
adaptation of a UPS copyrighted API open to registered users) is only
available via a pay for article on PHP | Architect. Obviously this is
his choice to make but goes against the spirit of open help of this
list.

I did purchase the articles in question as I needed the code as a
reference to complete a project at work. The articles are available as a
back copy on the PHP | Architect web site.

I would post my code adaptation, but I am unfamiliar with the legal
implications of doing so. At best it's a gray area as the code doesn't
work without the copyrighted API.

I appreciate the help that I received (even though  had to pay for it)
when I asked the same question, but I would call upon future posters to
post the code examples they reference or refrain from "advertising" on
this list. This was obviously a blatant plug to get PHP | Architect
subscription money that the author most likely received a royalty from,
and this list didn't get any part of that revenue despite that it
enabled any purchases that may have been made as a result of my post or
this post.

I'm guessing others feel as I do about this issue, and I respect anyone
else's opinion who may disagree.

Just my $.02

Cheers,

Tim Boyden

That is a troll.  You referenced a solution and didn't bother to
mention that it required a paid subscription.  That is deceptive, no
matter how valuable the article.  Rather than just apologizing for
doing that, you chose to give the rest of us a finance and ethics
lesson.

Like John and Ted mention, it's not about the money, I paid and I was
helped and I am grateful, it's about the ethics of full disclosure.

Besides, it's your work and you own the copyright on your design of the
solution, so you alone have the "opportunity" to help others in the
spirit of open source by providing the source code so others may freely
benefit from your work. If you choose not to do so it is your right, but
you should be forthwith and say so.

PHP is open source as well as this list. Share the code!

BTW I guess I'm in the wrong business as a Sys Admin, cause I don't
nearly make $30 an hour...

Pure nonsense.  Your asking for help if you don't like the answer  
thats your problem not someone else's.  You are free to do what you  
want no one is making you do anything here.  They could have just of  
easily said nothing and let you continue you to search.  Perhaps a  
little gratitude is in order that this list is here and you can get  
help if needed.  Thanks to all who have helped me in the past when I  
asked.

You have to see that those who are experienced in a particular topic are 
an elite. Just think back when you or some of the other experts started 
off knowing nothing about the subject. Asking questions and asking many 
of them is just are smart thing to do.
On the outsourcing issue, I have encountered many incompetent people who 
were US based. Just see how many US citizens can't even master their own 
language or even two or more! Those who ask many questions just want to 
get to the goal as quick as possible. Although it may be annoying for 
some, it isn't really anything wrong with that.

In order to get something useful out of Google you need to know what you 
are looking for. I once needed something that rotates images using PHP. 
As soon as you google for something with PHP as keyword you get 
bazillion results back just because the URL ends in .php.
I asked the same question on this list and got the best answer possible 
in no time. That is why people like mailing lists and that is why many 
come back and ask more questions. Further, it is much easier to ask an 
expert than to figure stuff out on your own running into all the traps 
along the way. In my opinion that is sole and pure reason for having 
such an email list.

If you are really frustrated by the load of mails from people asking 
questions then stop helping out. People will eventually go away when you 
keep ignoring them.

I don't see the problem, I often will reply to a question on a list with 
a reference to an article or chapter of a book.

If it is in a book by someone else it would be rude in the extreme to 
post it elsewhere.

I guess the difference is an insignificant matter.

To me, and I think to others who feel the same way, there is a
difference between saying -  "a good example is this (including possibly
a code snippet) from PHP in a Nutshell by O'Reilly Publishing"  - where
it is obvious that you need to go to a library or buy the book, and a
response like  - "Yeah, I did that, but you have to go pay for my code
that some magazine published to find out how to do it".

The first example is helpful, informative and courteous, while the
second example - though ultimately helpful if you choose to pay for the
articles - is nothing more than an advertising plug that only benefits
the magazine.

Hey, nice catch Cliff.

Convenience over security can come back to bite you, I guess.

To reiterate the point, if you use subversion to manage web
directories, you need to make sure that the .svn metadata will not be
served by apache.

Convenience sure makes me want to use this approach. And you could even
update the production "working copy" to a specific branch or tag, not just
the main trunk. But...it's still an update and conflicts would be a bear to
deal with in a production environment. Although there shouldn't be any
conflicts if the prod. Working copy isn't touched.

I do agree that the post was a plug, but a helpful plug that aided you 
in solving your problem.  As a list full of mature professionals, it's 
generally assumed that a commercial resource for information will cost 
money.  Disclaimers aren't specifically needed.  Especially considering 
a great deal of the contributors to the popular and, as proven, helpful 
php publications are regulars here.

You were in no way forced to cough up the cash.  You could have come 
back here and asked the community if any other resources were 
available.  You could have done more research, including checking the 
open source applications available like oscommerce and phpshop.  You 
could have read the thorough UPS tracking / rating specs, which are 
fairly thorough, and come up with your own library, but instead, 
accepted information from a commercial resource and then came to 
complain about having to pay for it, which is fairly useless to the rest 
of us.

It's sad you and others like you choose to focus your attacks on me
rather than assist the original poster with their question. I would
gladly help except my hands are tied by copyright.

So much for the professionalism.

At no time did I complain about having had to pay, instead I said I was
thankful for the help now, and before when I received the help (you can
check the archives and see for yourself), all I mentioned is that it had
to be paid for before it could be useful. There was no preview or code
snippets provided that would of indicated that it would be useful or
even relevant to my needs, but instead I took a leap of faith, paid for
the articles and luckily it worked out for me. I was left with that
option as no one else came to my assistance as you would suggest, and
for that much I am again grateful to "Digital Ink". If you're so sure
those open source apps provide the solution, why don't you help out and
post the code, it's open source so you wouldn't be violating any
copyright. I for one couldn't find the code that would lead to a
solution for me that wasn't embedded in a number of modules to
obscurity.

My main point of contention was not about cost, but about freely sharing
ideas and solutions - the real point of this list. You want pay for
solutions, head on over to www.experts-exchange.com

Those same contributors you mention don't come on here and ask you to
buy their book in order to get help either. They are very generous and
offer code help directly and freely. In return those who they've helped
(like me) return the favor and purchase their books to support their
efforts. There is a difference.

I do agree that the post was a plug, but a helpful plug that aided you
in solving your problem.  As a list full of mature professionals, it's
generally assumed that a commercial resource for information will cost
money.  Disclaimers aren't specifically needed.  Especially considering
a great deal of the contributors to the popular and, as proven, helpful
php publications are regulars here.

You were in no way forced to cough up the cash.  You could have come
back here and asked the community if any other resources were available.
You could have done more research, including checking the open source
applications available like oscommerce and phpshop.  You could have read
the thorough UPS tracking / rating specs, which are fairly thorough, and
come up with your own library, but instead, accepted information from a
commercial resource and then came to complain about having to pay for
it, which is fairly useless to the rest of us.

I manage several (>10) sites that are done in exactly this way -- the 
webroot is a subversion working copy, and the webserver is instructed to 
not serve up .svn directories. (You can also do this for applications, 
but it is a bit trickier.)

It works wonderfully!

The key is to be as disciplined with the use of subversion in updating 
the website as you would be if you did it using other shellscripts.

There are a few things you can do to help out:
1) Always do a dry run first. You'll catch any conflicts that arise 
(there shouldn't be, if you don't edit files in the production area 
independently). Also, you'll find out if one of your developers 
accidentally committed a file that should be environment-independent 
(for example, he added a config.php that would overwrite your production 
area configuration with the test area, etc.)

If you've got people changing files in your production area in an 
uncontrolled fashion, that's a bigger problem with which you must 
deal--although you can mitigate it with subversion by committing BACK to 
the repository from production :-)

2) If you have to make several concurrent changes (for example, you need 
to make database changes or restart processes at the same time) you'll 
need to do a bit of scripting to make things happen "atomically"--but 
you'd have to do this ANYWAY, regardless of how you moved your files 
into place.

The nice thing about subversion (or any good VCS) is that, 
theoretically, if all you have to do is move files into place, you can 
rollback to a last-known-good in the event of something horribly wrong 
happening (and yes it's happened) in a relatively straightforward fashion.

Of course, YMMV.

It goes the other way.  Making a release should always be a fresh check 
out of a (brand new) branch that got tagged on the testing server.

If any serious but easy to fix bugs appear on the production system, you 
just fix them, commit the changes back to the branch, and then merge 
those changes back to the trunk on your development system.

I'm not so sure, someone here posted insinuation that the author gets 
royalites for every back article that sells.  I think when you make 
those sort of accusations based on little more than guesswork, you have 
lost the right to complain about being "attacked" when others merely 
correct the statements and point out the alternatives.

UPS is rather annoying, they require you to create a shipping account in 
order to access their API.  If their true to most companies, I'm willing 
to bet there is a PHP API example there, along with enough ASP examples 
to work out what you need to do(though I have found ProStores to be very 
skimpy on their non-Java examples).

Checking Virtuemart, I note that there is no GPL UPS module.  Which is a 
general indicator that UPS is persnickety enough to justify paying for 
working models.

Hmmm, from PHP | Architect's website:

Re: php|architect's Author Guide (#110)
By Chad R. Smith on 2006-06-02 08:23:29

Yeah, I can vouch that it's really easy to write for them. Their people are
wonderful and will walk you through each step it takes. Their payments are
on time and good right off the bat. I in fact am trying to think of another
article to write for them!

Talking about accusations!

Do you really think I would of asked for help in the first place, let alone
pay for help, if there was a PHP example on UPS's web site?

The fact that UPS offers an API at all, let alone one that allows an XML
interface that enables interoperability with any programming language that
supports it, pretty much sums up their credibility and intent. Most
companies would require you to use a COM plug-in or ActiveX control to use
their site features so I'm not sure where you are coming from here. A free
registration to use a feature is a far cry from having to pay for the same
thing, something they could easily justify.

Again most people "disagreeing" (happy now) with me are doing so on the
presumed pretext of complaining to pay for help, one which if you read the
full thread and past threads regarding this subject you would know to be not
true. I thank everyone who has ever given me assistance and I return the
favor by helping others with no strings attached whenever I can.

I must say I'm surprised that no open source advocate has chosen to step up
in support of what my main argument is and continues to be, that if you
intend to provide assistance, on an open forum, for an open source
programming language, for the very thing that enables us to do what we do,
then you shouldn't ask someone to pay before assistance is even offered.

We're not talking about commercial support here, we're talking about helping
the little guy and the novice programmer learn about our chosen programming
language and encouraging them to take up the principles of Free (as in
freedom) Software and partake in our community.

I guess we're only for open source when it benefits us...and that's a shame
on all of us.

Message-ID: <200708210240.l7L2eir2021553@ms-smtp-01.rdc-nyc.rr.com>

Hello Everyone,
 
I have a table that contains about 40,000 rows of job posting data.   There
is a script that allows users to search for jobs using numerous search
criteria.  Because of all the criteria, the search process is very slow...an
average query takes about 10 seconds to display in a browser, which is way
too long.
 
I tried optimizing the queries and indexed the table, which is very hard
because of all the search criteria.
 
I'm trying to figure out a solution to speed up the searching process.  One
idea that I have is to create an XML document of all of the job posts and
write a search script that searches the XML document.   I'm not even sure if
this is possible as I haven't found any information about it on the web.
Has anyone tried to do this? Does anyone have any examples/resources of
search scripts that search XML documents?
 
Does anyone have any other ideas about speeding up the search process?
 
Thank you in advance.

Sincerely,
Nelly Yusupova

Without seeing your data model or even knowing what database you're 
using that question is almost impossible to answer.  Bear in mind 
however that indexed columns aren't a magic bullet, especially if you 
have lots of repeating data in them.

Use your query plan analyzer to figure out where the sluggishness is, 
paying close attention to "full table scan" or scans where the index 
file is being tossed.  If your database supports partitioning you can 
get quite a bit of improvement there.  Adding a second mirrored database 
just for job searches is another idea.  Minimize text searches; 
normalize common elements like start date, industry, category, job 
position, etc.

I've written four job boards and each employed different techniques 
specific to the business requirements.  One thing you might try however 
is to dump the jobs as text and let local search engine software index 
them several times a day.  There are a lot of API tricks you can use to 
specialize those searches.

What database are you using?  Are there any wildcards in the query of
the form "LIKE '%$term"?  If so, you should try full text indexes on
those columns and use MATCH/AGAINST assuming you are using mysql.

XML is going to be a dead-end unless you have a tool to index the XML.
 Creating a search engine for 40k records should be doable with just
SQL/ full text indexes. You shouldn't need anything specialized until
you hit about 0.5M records, in which case you should probably use
specialized software (e.g. Lucene).

        Php Version: 4.3.10

 I need assistance in displaying images from a database into a table. 
 The script is successfully getting the image from the database in placing them int he table that i created. The problem is, each row is repeating the same image, ie, item one is shown in column 1, column 2, column3 , and column 4 in row 1. The item 2 is shown in column 1, column 2, column3 , and column 4 in row 2, and so on. I am at a lost on how to display the images so that each item is displayed in consectively rows and columns as needed without repeating themselves. I will copy the script below. 
 If any one can see my error, i would appriciate the input.  Thanks:

I think John hit the nail on the head but for your
mysql_fetch_array($result), I like to use mysql_fetch_array($result,
MYSQL_ASSOC) just to qualify that the array returned is associative.  Or for
short you can use mysql_fetch_assoc($result).  That way only an associative
array is returned.

Create a public __toString() function within your Database class. It can be
something as simple as:

public function __toString() {
  return 'Object';
}

This is a new as of 5.2 - for some reason they've removed implicit
object-to-string conversion. You must provide explicit __toString if you're
printing or concatenating your objects.

Create a public __toString() function within your Database class. It can be
something as simple as:

public function __toString() {
  return 'Object';
}

This is a new as of 5.2 - for some reason they've removed implicit
object-to-string conversion. You must provide explicit __toString if you're
printing or concatenating your objects.

You should check out Capistrano some time.  It pulls down the whole  
app from subversion into a new directory.  It then symlinks the  
current webroot to the new directory pulled from subversion.  You  
also keep files - like things users have uploaded - in a separate  
directory and symlink to that from your docroot too.  That way  
they're outside of the app directories.

What I like about this approach is that all the files still exist  
from the previous working state and if anything is wrong, you just  
switch the docroot symlink to point to the old directory - very quick  
recovery.

Capistrano is a ruby app the allows automated scripting and parallel  
updates on multiple servers at the same.  Worth looking into before  
rolling out your own custom shell scripts.

+1 for Capistrano, it saves so much time ...

But if you need something else even more lightweight ... Vlad the  
Deployer (yes, that is the name, no typo) ...

Looks great, but:

"The assumptions made by the default tasks are more specific, but are either
configurable or overridable. Some of them are:

    * You are deploying a web application -- check
    * You are using Ruby on Rails to develop your application -- bit of a

    * You are using subversion to manage your source code -- check
    * You are deploying your application to ?/u/apps/#{appname}? on every

    * You are using FastCGI to power your application -- ?
    * You are fronting your app with either lighttpd or apache -- check

The only thing that pertains to that you are developing a Rails  
application is that you have a "config" folder @ the root level so  
that a "deply.rb" script can be set there. (old method)

In fact the new method is just to have a Capfile in your root +  
describe tasks.  From there you would run your tasks.  The FastCGI  
you can skip, instead you would do something like restart Apache if  
you needed to.

Id say the real PHP equivalent of the entire process would be Phing  
(http://phing.info/trac/) but w/ deployment recipes.

FiOS isn't available to me yet but I will keep watching. What's RCN? In any
case it looks like Comcast has a monopoly on all non-DSL, consumer-type

Many thanks to all.

I happen to live in an area where FiOS is in direct competition with my
Comcast line, good news for me I got a good bump in connection speed.  I
maxed out at about 64mbps the other day, insanely fast just to browse the
web.  I know other people in the community also got a bump in speed as well
from Comcast as they don't want anyone to leave (so for the same price I get
a bump in speed, go consumerism!).

 

But I have also heard good things about FiOS but make sure your neighborhood
has access to it.  Also in regards to your friends server David, I tried to
do that once with Verizon, they saw the bandwidth traffic and blocked the
port 80 incoming requests, that's when I called up and they said I was
violating my TOS when I decided to host a web server at a residential IP
address.

That is when you change the server over to a different port and use a 
webhop. At least that is how I got it to work...pssssst.

Guess it is in there.  "Any type of server" - that's a little harsh.   
I guess it's not reasonable for them to list what is acceptable (like  
having a svn port open for personal use) because people will find  
some loophole for running their illegal file sharing server.

     3.7.5 You may not use the Broadband Service to host any type of  
server whether personal or commercial in nature.

I have used similar ones, Actually this one is loosely based on the on in
the Zoop Framework called forms which predates it about half a year. Zoop's
Forms interface is a decent amount simplier and the validation is a better
integrated, but of course it only works inside of the framework.

Such systems are useful for dominately CRUD applications. They aren't as
scalable as hand made forms, unless you use make use of caching (I don't
know if this system supports caching, Zoop's does). They are much more
efficient on the programmer side.

40k rows is small.  Searching is what databases excel at.  Using XML is 
crazy.

Use the EXPLAIN / DESCRIBE query keywords to get some very useful 
information.

Also read up on how indexes work in the DBMS you're using.  The MySQL 
manual has a very good section on it, for example.

I wanted to add a few cents about the role of a version control system
in managing websites.

Release Engineering is a complex subject worthy of it's own
profession.  I say that because I've worked in a Release Engineering
team supporting multiple software products and distributed teams
numbering in the hundreds.  If you have complex software that you need
to release or distribute, then you will invariably use tools like
Phing, Ant etc.

That said, releasing website code, even 'application' code can easily
be handled by using a 'working copy' checkout from a Subversion
repository.  I would consider it 'good form' to use this approach.  In
fact this makes it incredibly easy to release code through dev to
staging to production.   And it is easy to revert (with or without
tags).  Tags are just a convenience (and generally recommended when
you have an actual QA or test process.)

For people using this approach, do an 'svn status -u' to show what
would be updated prior to doing an 'svn up'.

Oh I did that, but then I had to go to managed hosting cause I needed

That is when you change the server over to a different port and use a 
webhop. At least that is how I got it to work...pssssst.

I had a home server for quite a while with comcast.  They never  
blocked any ports on me since you get a dynamic ip address I would  
think that would be hard to do.  I did find myself booted off the  
network about once a month and I would have to reset my router to get  
back on.  With hosting so affordable it didn't make sense to invest  
the time to do it after a while.  To many work arounds to do it and  
then keeping up with security issues.  My server was probed constantly  
for attacks. It was a good learning experience though.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Tuning MySQL Full Text Search
Message-ID: <01cb01c7e4cb$d855bca0$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello All, 

I've got search for very small database working fine. However, I'd like to tune this to have 
different weights for words, because I'm not happy with the search results.

Are there any good books or whitepapers on tuning mysql for fulltext search?

Here's the query:

        $dbObject->DatabaseQuery('SELECT id, title, body, links_to,'
                                . ' MATCH(title, body)'
                                . ' AGAINST (' . $dbObject->Safe($searchStr)
                                . ' IN BOOLEAN MODE)'
                                . ' AS score FROM ' . DATABASE_TABLE_CONTENT
                                . ' WHERE MATCH (title, body)'
                                . ' AGAINST (' . $dbObject->Safe($searchStr)
                                . ' IN BOOLEAN MODE)'
                                . ' ORDER BY score DESC',
                                constReturnArray, LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG);

And here's the index code:
       $dbObject->DatabaseQuery('CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX skillings_index ON ' .
            DATABASE_TABLE_CONTENT . ' (title, body);', constReturnNone, LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG);

I would say build an index if its items which will rarely change.   
There is real power in using a Lucene-based index for full text  
search that a DB does not really focus on and would meet your  
requirements better.  Ive recently put a 200k record set thorough  
Zend_Search and the clients were pretty happy w/ how results could be  
tuned and refined.

Also remember the fulltext parser is pluggable, example ...

http://www.mnogosearch.org/doc/msearch-udmstemmer.html

Has anyone written one for Zend_Search?  Id love to figure out how to  
cross the 2 w/o the need to configure my updates ...

Hey Ben,

Are you not happy with the relevance sorting?  Or is it not returning  
rows that you think should match... or return too many rows?  What's  
an example of how you could weight the words?

You should test this to see if it's true... but I've seen it  
mentioned that the score returned by "IN BOOLEAN MODE" is an integer  
with the number of terms matched.  Without "IN BOOLEAN MODE", it  
gives a floating point number that " is computed based on the number  
of words in the row, the number of unique words in that row, the  
total number of words in the collection, and the number of documents  
(rows) that contain a particular word."

Actually... do you need the "IN BOOLEAN MODE"?  Otherwise, results  
are automatically sorted on relevance.

Also... you could put a higher weight on title matches over body  
matches:
( (3 * MATCH(title) AGAINST ('term')) + (1 * MATCH(body) AGAINST  
('term')) )

-Rob

Hello Jon, 

A lot of what you said went over my head. I no zero experiance with Zend, and I dont know what "Lucene" is.
I'll look into Zend_Search, and the link provided.

Thanks!

Hello Rob,

I'm happy w/the relevance, but the order isn't right, and too many results 
are being returned (which is my own issue to fix).

> ( (3 * MATCH(title) AGAINST ('term')) + (1 * MATCH(body) AGAINST 
> ('term')) )

That's really cool. I didn't realize you could do that, and that is 
something I'd like to do.
Without the BOOLEAN, the results were really off, minimal results and not 
that accurate.
Once I added BOOLEAN, the results got a lot better.

There is also the problem where common words, aren't returning anything, 
such as a search for
"water". It should however, since the water keyword is very frequent 
throughout the site.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Frameworks - Which best fits my development style?
Message-ID: <024701c7e4dc$f2981660$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello all, 

I know there has been a ton of discussion about frameworks.

So far, I've looked into:
1) Cake
2) Zend
3) Joomla
4) Symfony
5) Drupal

I've looked at tutorials, books and online how-tos'. Let me explain my development environment.

I use smarty templates for all my HTML.  My php is 5w/OOP. I have many libraries from everything
from database access, sitemap creation, html (textboxes, drop downs), simple ajax, error logging,
session handling, (all created by myself) and I use PEAR SOMETIMES as to not reinvent the wheel
for a single project. When I design sites & applications, I have an index.php and pass "actions=WHATEVER" 
on the URL to change the action of the program. I dont use seperate files for different things EXCEPT for all the libs
and auxiliary functions. I use SVN for revision control.

I guess I don't see the compelling reason to switch to a framework. Will it really speed up my development
time, even if I have all these libs (and still expanding) already created?

The JSON stuff looks cool, but I dont use that much js and if I do, I just write it myself.

Applications I build are powered by PHP/MYSQL, HTML/CSS. There are forms to fillout, emailing, login, 
account creation, etc. Some are more complicated than others.

Maybe I could use one framework for making simple websites, and another for applications?

I'm really looking for success stories or terros from switching from no framework to using one,
which one, how long it took to be effecient with it, how easy it was to expand/modify, the
userbase and user support, scalability, ease of use, organization of codebase, etc. Also, 
I LOVE books, so any that have good paperback book or white paper/tutorials is a BIG plus.

Any feedback is helpful, and please provide pros/cons.

Thanks so much!

Maybe this is because boolean searches don't use the 50% threshold: ""

Weird... that would be in line with the 50% threshold... but you're  
using boolean, so it shouldn't apply.  Maybe try rebuilding the index?

Also... boolean searches do have an operator (< or >) to increase or  
decrease a word's weight:

Hello Rob,

What I meant is that, something that has the search criteria in the title,
doesn't have more weight than something that does not, and therefor
is possibly showing up lower then another item, when I believe its
more relevant and should be displayed higher.

I'll try to rebuild the index. In order to do so, do I just run the command 
that I did to build the
original index, or is there a special syntax/command to do so?

> Also... boolean searches do have an operator (< or >) to increase or

Cool. I'll look into that.

Thank,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Using Pagination 
Message-ID: <000601c7e4e3$04542140$0200a8c0@X9183>

I am really sorry to have to ask your help once again, but no matter how
hard I try I can't seem to understand how pagination works

I created a MySQL database called "test_db" and then  set up the demo table
"products". the products.php is just a dummy.

nate.php is the coding.

I am trying to paginate through the records one by one.(view each record, in
this case).

Thanks
Paul

It's clear that the TOS for residential accounts say "no servers, period"
but I think it's ridiculous to tell us we can't even run sshd to move files
to and from our home machines when we're away from home. That's what's nice
about Speakeasy. It's your Internet connection and you can use it as you

In other words you should stuff all that FULLTEXT inside of an index  
engine and let it deal w/ it since it is 10x better @ it ...

Im working on a major site and we're using symfony. I can tell you that 
symfony gives you pretty much everything you need so your own classes will 
not be of much use (and even if you see something it doesn't do, you will 
most likely find a plugin already written that does).

It uses PHP5 so its a total OOP environment with an MVC architecture and 
its own testing library. The command-line tool can generate code and stub 
files (and can even be used for deployment).

One nice thing is that a lot of features can be switched on and off 
through config files which reduces coding. (And most of the config files 
are YAML files that get compiled and cached). I would describe symfony as 
simply elegant.

The documentation, (The Apress book is available online), wiki, forums, 
mailing list, and snippets sites mean there is plenty of docs and sample 
code to look at (this more than anything else made coding with symfony a
really nice experience).

Ive gained enough experience and confidence with symfony that Im also 
converting an existing Joomla site to symfony (Joomla really was overkill 
for that site anyway and symfony is really easy to work with). There is a 
small learning curve but its not the hardest curve Ive ever had to climb 
and the Apress book is a nice read.

> Applications I build are powered by PHP/MYSQL, HTML/CSS. There are forms to fillout, emailing, login, 
> account creation, etc. Some are more complicated than others.

Forms validation is super easy - you setup validation "rules" in a YAML 
file. Add some code to your actions class and you're done. (symfony 
already comes with a bunch of built-in validators but you can also roll 
your own - something we only needed to do in two places IIRC).

I should also mention that symfony has scaffolding and also generators for 
building a complete admin tool for your database models (so implementing a 
backend interface is easy).

> Maybe I could use one framework for making simple websites, and another for applications?

Sure, its possible to do that. For example, Joomla is great for an 
e-commerce site (Ive implemented e-commerce in Mambo, Joomla and symfony), 
since Joomla has a nicely pre-built backend for the customers to use. I 
never liked the documentation available for Joomla (though Joomla just 
published a nice book a month ago which might help).

> Also, I LOVE books, so any that have good paperback book or white paper/tutorials is a BIG plus.

Me too. You're in luck then - here's some references (incl. the official 
book):

Actually... I think this is the command:
REPAIR TABLE tbl_name QUICK;

Like Jon, I've been leaning towards ditching using mysql for fulltext  
searches lately.  I haven't gotten a chance to test out  
Zend_Search_Lucene yet... but probably will soon.

See you at mysql camp.

Ben,

We went from hand rolled sites to CakePHP and have had very good success.
Took us about 5 days to get up to speed.  We do a lot of outsource work with
firms in the US, India and Ukraine and they have all really enjoyed working
with CakePHP.  Most of our clients don't care as long as it works and its
fast.

The best part about the Cake framework (or any MVC Rails-Like framework) is
it writes itself from your business logic.  If you're a programmer first and
not an architect this may seem foreign but if you build your data and
process relationships first, develop your business domain as a system of
data/process silos, then a MVC based framework really helps to keep thing in
line.  We document in UML and the MVC design pattern (and CakePHP) fit well.

A side benefit of having this type of organized structure is the data
defines the design.  For data silos, the relationships of the data is what
generates your SQL calls.  Your need to hand write complex Many-to-Many SQL
calls will drop dramatically (we still write a few, but not many).

It takes some practice for many programmers because it isn't a natural
transition, but if you can take off the programmer hat and look at your
projects from the problem and solution domain instead, you will find that
these frameworks begin to fit your new thinking.  This is what I have found
watching our programmers and outsource groups make the change over.

(Full disclosure: I am the author of the Solar framework for PHP.)

Not to be flippant, but it looks like you have built a framework of  
your own already.

I am not surprised that you don't see a compelling reason to use  
something else.  You have a familia way-of-working in tools and  
techniques, and you don't want to change those to suit someone else's  
way-of-working (which is perfectly fair).

To be clear, you won't be switching from "no-framework" to another  
one, but from "your-framework" to another one.  Changing to another  
framework (one written by someone else) will require you to change  
your approach and habits, and that sucks; just ask Laura Thomson.

I know that doesn't help much. :-/

Absolutely - not having to deal with writing a whole database abstraction 
or ORM layer really frees you to concentrate more on the business logic 
and flow of the application.

I find the fact that if something does go wrong in a framework(ed)  
environment you know *exactly* where to look (even if the project is  
not yours) so its normally the debugging aspect of the project I look  
@ first.

Also I think the IDEs are going to (or should) accommodate more and  
more frameworks in the future which is where the quick agile  
development will really be.

I'm in the same boat. Although I just switched jobs, so I don't have  
my framework anymore. Some of the frameworks require you to program  
to their standards and use the entire framework, like Drupal. I  
prefer to use only the pieces I need or the parts that are better  
than mine. The Zend framework is designed around that concept, so you  
can continue to use your framework and just incorporate pieces of  
theirs.
I found a lot of the frameworks are designed around creating/managing  
a site. In my case, web sites are just the presentation of various  
pieces. The same "piece" can appear on any number of sites. The site  
isn't the central point, it's the "piece" that's important. The site  
is whatever the creative group comes up with, I just plugin the  
pieces. Many of the frameworks don't lend themselves to this type of  
setup. Most of my code lives in a centralized directory accessible by  
all web sites. Which is why I seem to be settling on Zend.

Beside the __toString() workaround mentioned, I'd get to the root of the 
matter: objects are not strings, so fix the code where you're using them 
as such.  Are you, by chance, using an object as an array key?

Dan,

While the Q&D (Quick and Dirty) method solved the problem...you are
correct...makes sense to find out the real source of the problem.

As best as I can tell...what made PHP annoyed was when I instantiated a
class from within another class. That is, class "A" was instantiated by one
of the methods in class "B."

Certainly that's true of Joomla, Drupal and Xaraya.

Its not true of things like CakePHP or symfony.

I would challenge this point... as I've seen the opposite happening
more and more.  There is a budding school of thought among new PHP'ers
that says "you do it this way or it's wrong".  Yes, the developers are
to blame, not the framework, but it concerns me a bit that they're
seeing everything in relation to how it doesn't match their framework
of choice.

That's originally why I picked up the Zend Framework.  Instead of a
fixed structure for my applications, it felt more like a tool box.  I
can reach in and pull out Logging, PDF creation, DB access, whatever
and only use the pieces I need.  It hasn't required a
re-write/re-structuring of my applications, so it's been more
evolutionary as opposed to scorched earth.  In fact, while working on
site for a major news network, I added logging using Zend_Log in about
45 minutes.

Full Disclosure:  Technically, I'm a contributor to the Zend Framework
(signed the CLA), but I have yet to contribute anything... but I am
speaking at ZendCon about the above experience.

Hmm... That in itself isn't a problem.  Perhaps you were using the

Bingo. That is exactly how I approach things:

1. Simple websites, like corporate portals: Joomla CMS (Drupal as an
alternative)
2. Big, complex custom sites: CakePHP (Symfony as an alternative)
3. Targeted, specific custom sites: Joomla 1.5 Framework (Zend
Framework as an alternative)

It may be to my familiarity with Joomla, but I cannot launch a
garden-variety corporate site on anything else as quickly or
efficiently. Stock Joomla and a template, and I'm done. Total time: 15
minutes, and the admin interface is still the easiest I've been able
to find out there.

For monster projects, I like the scaffolding-style frameworks to help
with the load. Integrated testing and change management/deployment
tools are essential in this regard.

Then there are the simple, specific applications or websites that do a
specific thing. Those can be pieced together using what I call
'includes style frameworks' like Joomla 1.5 Framework or Zend, as you
just load what you need to get the job done, and can control bloat.
Here you might end up just sticking with the stuff you've already
created, as it does indeed sound like you have your own framework
going on already.

Just like a carpenter, our jobs as technologists should be to know how
to use a multitude of tools (hammer, saw, etc) and our experience
should be able to tell us when to use which.

I've branched out to Rails (and of course Ruby) and can say I'm
writing more elegant PHP code as a result.

Paul, here is how I would approach your problem (if I have understood 
it correctly. I'm sure the experts on the list will be
able to improve this code, but it does work:

INDEX.PHP
session_start();

// get stuff from the db, unshown
$pagePointer = 0;
while( $row = mysql_fetch_row( $result ) {
   // store each row in the session
   $_SESSION['pages'][$pagePointer] = $row;
   $pagePointer ++;
}
// count how many rows we have
$_SESSION['pageCount'] = count( $_SESSION['pages'];
// redirect to the display
header( Location:pages.php?start=0 );

PAGES.PHP
<?php
session_start();

// orient ourselves
$start = $_GET['start']; // error checking skipped
$last = $_SESSION['pageCount'] - 1; // arrays start at 0, count starts at 1
$previous = $start - 1;
if ( $previous < 0 ) $previous = $last;
$next = $start + 1;
if ( $next > $last ) $next = 0;

// display this one somehow
print_r( $_SESSION['pages'][$start] );
// provide links to move through each page

There are 2 kinds of pagination.

One assumes the data is dynamic and could change at any point in time.  
So, for every query you run, you save off a copy of the data to disk and 
use that report for forward and back.

The other kind assumes the data is static(a list of products that is 
rarely updated, for example) and that you don't care about the 
occassional odd case of someone trying to go forward or back and not 
getting what they would expect.

For the latter case,  you just need to know what record you were looking 
at in the table and use the limit command on your SQL.

IE, LIMIT 0,1

Start at the first record, give me 1 record

So when they click forward or back, they send row=3 or row=1 assuming 
your on the second row

Than you set $rownum to the row variable, and your query becomes
LIMIT $rownum, 1

The problem with this case is say there are 100 records in the database, 
and the person is on #90
While they are there, you delete record 89 and then they use the 
previous button to load record 89..it loads what used to be record 
90(the one they were looking at).

Honestly, it's not elegant, but this is good enough for many situations.

actually, the most effective technique is very simple... all you need is a query, the page number you want and the number of items on a page.First execute your query but don't fetch the resuts. Keep in mind is that executing a query takes a fraction of the time & resources it takes to fetch the result set and build an array - especially if it's a large result set. $qh = mysql_query($sql, [connection stuff]);All you want to fetch is the page of data you want to display, so you want to shift the result set's internal pointer to the right spot. The index you want will be (PageNumber -1) * numberOfItemsOnPage:mysql_data_seek($qh, $index); This is also very fast and will return false if the index is out of range.Now, you can do a fetch loop until you get a page's worth of rows or reach the end of the result set. No matter how big the result set is, you're always building a small array so it's pretty fast..If you'd like to display how many rows were returned, use?mysql_num_rows($qh);?This also uses the query handle and is also very fast.Since you can execute your query every time without a lot of overhead, it doesn't really matter how volatile the data is.While this example uses mysql, other engines have similar functions available too.

Hi, I created a drawing application flash using actionscript then I wanted to save the drawing in a jpg file.  I succefulkly saved the file however upon looking at the output image, the output is not smooth,  I used imagefillpolygon for lines thicker than 1px coz according to php.net imagesetthickness is only applicable to orthogonal lines.  I also tried to use imgaesetthickness but the output was worse.  I got convincing output when I convert the drawing to swf using PHP ming.  Attached is the output image could someone help me with this?

Thanks,

Jason,

It looks like you are probably generating a huge number of points for
the line, so you've got a lot of polygons and possibly the jagged edges
you are seeing are from misplaced corners.  You will probably need to
post some code so that we can see exactly what is happening.

My guess would be that we don't need to see the flash stuff, but just
the gd script and the data you're feeding it.

Methinks this is not so much PHP as plain human nature, programmers are 
by nature rules-bound, thinking in terms of the problem domain is not 
necessarily our first reflex, but when we learn it it it is what makes 
computers really do the magic they do.

PHP is still penetrating the enterprise space and has such the community 
has not "grown up" enough yet.  Both behaviors mentioned above can be 
seen, it depends upon where you look.

Frameworks are a result of a breakthrough in thinking -- there is not 
necessarily a perfect way to do anything, but if you pick a way and do 
it consistently, the consistency itself will bring real productivity 
gains.  You leave behind the headaches of having to work out a solution 
to every problem, only to find out later what the weaknesses of your 
answer were.  You join a group that are all doing things the same way 
and can teach each other and help each other out.

You also leave behind that naive rules-based thinking that there is only 
one perfect way to do anything.  But ironically it doesn't look this 
way.  The framework becomes the new accepted way to do things for the 
sake of consistency, and sometimes people mistake that for new 
rules-bound inflexibility.

I would argue that that makes it what you called it - a toolbox, and not 
a framework.  A toolbox gives you ways to do whatever you want, while a 
framework tends to give you more of an assembly line.

         I used to teach Computer Science at the college and graduate 
level. When OOP first
started the programmers with a lot of experience had real difficulty 
seeing the advantage and
adapting to the new methodology. However, students who were just 
starting to program had
no problem adjusting.

         I think it's simply human nature to keep wanting to do 
things that have worked well in
the past.

Jason,

It looks like you are probably generating a huge number of points for
the line, so you've got a lot of polygons and possibly the jagged edges
you are seeing are from misplaced corners.  You will probably need to
post some code so that we can see exactly what is happening.

My guess would be that we don't need to see the flash stuff, but just
the gd script and the data you're feeding it.

I dunno, I think that in a lot of cases there was this tendency for 
people to descibe every aspect of OOP as a new way of doing things.

"We have classes" - yeah, I have those, their called function libraries.

"You can create subclasses" - yeah, I can do that to, it's called making 
a copy of my library and changing it.(yes yes, it's not the same.  OTOH, 
I've seen subclasses get so mangled beyond recognition that the 
relationship to the original class is meaningless).

"We have references to objects" - I have pointers.

Don't get me wrong, OOP has it's own strength.  It takes all the good 
coding practices that people should have been doing anyway, and 
formalizes and enforces them.  And than it creates a whole new way of 
writing bad code.

But, here is the catch, every now and then it doesn't work.  You can't 
do something in an object oriented fashion, and figuring out how to 
circumvent it can be a pain.

So, if your a programmer that is already disciplined to using the good 
practices, and you can easily write code adhering to those practices but 
have the flexibility of breaking them when it is economically the best 
decision - you will really really really recent being forced not to.

After the second or third time I had "refereneces" explained in this 
incredibly complex jargon, which boiled down to "it's a pointer" - and 
having steam come out of the ears of the explainer that I dared compare 
his OOP baby to regular old programming, I started to see the point of 
programmers that didn't like OOP.

A lot of terminology was changed just for the sake of calling it 
something "new".  I don't know the reasoning involved, my guess would be 
it was done to force programmers to think in a new way and not confuse 
it with old techniques and intermix.   And that's fine, as long as you 
have the decency to admit that the 2 terms are pretty similiar.

The programming examples for object oriented programming were just 
tedious in the extreme.  Pet subclassed to Dog subclassed to German 
Shepherd.  The problem was that each subclassing was such a trivial 
change,. that it seemed like a waste of time(oh, and don't get me 
started on programmers that would declare that Object Oriented 
programming would solve everything and so they would rewrite their 
applications in Java or whatever the latest craze was.  The end result 
was that instead of having a big chunk of code that was written by a 
team, we now had a section of code that could only be maintained by one 
person, and another section that only another person could maintain.  It 
only makes business sense to rewrite code when your going to train your 
whole team in it, not when one guy thinks it looks good on his resume).

Does anyone use phpGACL? Good, bad, ugly? Alternative? Other suggestions for
access control? This looks like an easy drop in, although the UI is wicked
confusing.

It's used in Joomla! 1.x although I think this was something that was to be
replaced in 1.5?  Perhaps Mitch can chime in here.

It was intended for 1.0, then got pushed to 1.1 which became 1.5, and
now is sitting in 1.6 waiting for the chance to be released to the
world ;-)

phpGACL was what was originally intended to be implemented, however
there were some challenges behind making that possible. Andrew Eddie
is behind the current ACL work, so he's most definitely the best
resource to ask that question to.

I know the base tables were there even in the Mambo days, but we never
implemented the logic to support it as it broke backwards
compatibility.

Ditto for the next implementation, methinks.

As for phpGACL, the feedback I got was that most ACLs out there are
good at answering one question, from the following list:

1) "Can I access this object?"
2) "Who can access this object?"

The trouble is finding an ACL that is equally adept at doing both.

dotProject has been using phpGACL for about 2.5 years or so.  When we
implemented it, we found that some of it was nasty due to the level of
granularity that we needed so we wrote a wrapper around it to hide
most of it from the core of the code.

Lately we've been adding helper methods to the various core classes to
further abstract this and simplify the overall API.  I think it's
worked out pretty well and has hidden all the complexity while still
allowing admins to define very specific permissions while respecting
parent/child relationships.  For example, knowing that someone has
permissions to see a specific Project doesn't imply anything about the
attached tasks.

For the most part, we ignore the 2nd question but also ask the
opposite of the first - "Am I denied access to this object?"

If you check out dotProject, the core of the implementation is in
classes/permissions.php.

I understand #1. That's the main point -- access control. But why do I need
#2? To see if I need to bar the door for someone as the # of rules, groups,
users grows increasingly complex?

I like having an instant front-end gui for setting up the ACLs. That's where
phpGACL seems to make sense. But it doesn't solve the issue of implementing it
in an application. I'm guessing thats where a really well designed and
structured front-end controller could be handy. It would just need to check
permission based on a page/action.

I think number 2 translates to things like "Who else can read posts to
this forum?" or "What developers have commit access" or even reports
like "List all editors by site".

I was waiting for you to chime in here. Just re-read your RBAC chapter in Pro
PHP Security (AWESOME BOOK, BTW). Nice Hamptons beach reading. Its that or
Clive Cussler.

As I think about this, the problem is all the "locations". A front-end
controller can consolidate or automatically synthesize and manage locations.
But there could be soooo many. And it seems to me the presentation layer needs
a heck of a lot of if statements to hide sections, links, buttons, etc. if you
want to hide unaccessible stuff instead of a simple "not authorized" msg.

That depends on your information architecture (how interconnected is
everything, really?) and how granular your access policies are. But
it's true what you say--there's a _lot_ of checking to see if the user
can do this or access that in any reasonably complex system.

I just looked at a typical calendar view and counted around 360
separate access control checks. It's extremely important that these
checks be as inexpensive as possible--you obviously don't want to hit
the database or ldap directory that many times.

But that doesn't mean you have to write a bunch of conditional
statements. Access control is, ideally, itegrated into your framework.
When you fetch a collection of objects to populate a navigation menu,
the ones that the user doesn't have access to shouldn't be sent to the
presentation layer in the first place.

That "embeddedness" is the main reason why we didn't include an actual
RBAC system in Pro PHP Security--the sample code would have had to
implement an entire mini framework.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Linux editors
Message-ID: <46D1B9AB.4000307@beezifies.com>

Since there are a lot of people here who probably code in PHP(ha) and 
use Linux, I thought I'd ask here if anyone is familiar with GUI 
programmer editors in Linux.


Yes, yes, I can and do use VI when on linux.  But my work habits have 
formed over the years based on using the best tool for my mindset on the 
platform I had to use(Windows XP).

So my editor of choice has been UltraEdit.

The features of UltraEdit which I like(and they are probably laughably 
small):

FTP built into the editor:
I can open my files right off a remote server without any fiddle 
faddling around.

SSH built into the editor:
More importantly FTP over SSH so I can still open files right off a 
remove server.

Automatic code collapse:
Ultraedit has a tag library for PHP and HTML.

When I'm editing a PHP file, it automatically find the start and stop of 
tags and I can collapse them.  So I can open a huge PHP file, collapse 
all the functions into single lines, and than scan through and find the 
function I'm interested in.

While coding, once I have finished a section, I can collapse it and see 
what came before it and goes after it.

It is this last feature that I have had a hard time finding in other 
editors.  Heck, I downloaded the latest Dreamweaver for a ProStores 
project(as it was the only way to get the who collection of program 
scripts out of prostores without downloading 1 by 1) and the best it had 
to offer was that I could create my own code foldings. 

At the past PHP meeting, it finally sunk in to me that for years I've 
been saying "I'd really love to develop in Linux, but I have to run 
Lotus Notes for work and you can't get the full environment to work 
reliably in Linux[ok, that's not quite TRUE.  Those individuals who were 
not second class citizens at work were welcome to use the Linux test 
platform which had all such goodness built into it.  However, such a 
platform was not for the likes of a second class contractor such as 
myself.  The best I could get was a notes client, but no development or 
admin client without which I was dead in the water)

Well, that time is past, and other than the periodic UG meeting I will 
likely never set foot in that company again, and even if I do I won't 
need to keep my personal system compatible with their work environment.  
So, it's time to bite the bullet.  Time to learn to code in linux and 
break my bad Windows habits.

All I need is the editor to do it with.

So any suggestions?

Oh, as a follow up, approximately 1 year ago I did try the Komodo 
editor, since it was available for Windows and Linux.  I felt that if it 
did what I needed in windows, I could then migrate to Linux.

At the time it did not have code folding built in.  I'll review it again 
and see if that has changed.

Zend-IDE rarely lets me down. When it does I blame Java. ;-)

If you're looking for something free, the PHP IDE for Eclipse project
is roughly equivalent, plus you get all of the other Eclipse goodness
in the bargain. We had a presentation on it at the February NYPHP
meeting, but the slides never made it online...

Mainly I am looking for something I can test drive first. 

Ultraedit cost 50$ and Komodo would cost me $100 to upgrade to the 
latest version.

So I guess I'd use that as my budget, I want a decent editor for PHP and 
HTML with code folding and FTP/SFTP access for under 100$(there ARE 
other features I like, but if it has those two it will have enough of 
the other features to make it worthwhile)

My general feeling is that a good independent dev environment is worth 
between 200 and 300 to me.  Of course, siuce I already have one that I 
like, now my feeling is that for me going over 100 would not be worth 
the jump.

I can never figure out any of the Eclipse based IDEs and the ZEND stuff 
is designed as if the developers never saw a desktop app before.

I use NuSphere's PHPEd, which is available for both Windope and Linux. 
They offer trial versions and the Standard edition was around 50 bucks 
when I bought it during one of their sales.
I don't know if it does the FTP and SSH stuff as I never use that, but 
you can easily find out by looking at their website. The best thing 
about PHPEd is the debugger implementation.

Reminds me that I need to finish the rundown of my tests that I promised 
months ago....ooops.

My own personal experience has gone from Modelworks SitePad on  
Windows -> Bluefish on Linux -> TextMate on OS X.

I actually liked Bluefish, but have not kept up on what the latest  
1.0 delivered.

I can never figure out any of the Eclipse based IDEs and the ZEND stuff 
is designed as if the developers never saw a desktop app before.

I use NuSphere's PHPEd, which is available for both Windope and Linux. 
They offer trial versions and the Standard edition was around 50 bucks 
when I bought it during one of their sales.
I don't know if it does the FTP and SSH stuff as I never use that, but 
you can easily find out by looking at their website. The best thing 
about PHPEd is the debugger implementation.

Reminds me that I need to finish the rundown of my tests that I promised 
months ago....ooops.

 it is suppose to display a 4 column table with an indiffenate number of rows.
 Instead it displays one image in row , then 3 images in row 2.  Then one image in row 3 and e images in row 4, and so on.  thanks.  Here is the code:
 
 require_once('connect/mysql_connect.php');
 
 $query="SELECT item_id, modelnum, name, upload, size, description, price, gender FROM clothing ORDER BY item_id ASC";
   $result=@mysql_query($query);

 $col = 0;
 echo '<table border="0" width="90%" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" align="center">';
 
 if($num>0) {

 if($col == 0)
 echo '<tr>';

If I understand correctly what you are trying to do, the simple way 
to do this is to end a row and start a new row in your table every 
time you have finished displaying four rows from the database, like 
this, using your $num variable:
<table>
<tr>
// loop through result
// display stuff
if ( $num % 4 == 0 ) echo '</tr><tr>';
}
</tr>
</table>

I actually see them as hitting slightly different markets in my mind.

UltraEdit - A great editor, syntax highlighting, code folding, great
SFTP support (I'll still
put UltraEdit's SFTP support up against ZDE & Komodo any day). Worked great with
a lot of files, always fast, responsive. A couple nice smaller
features like the function
list for easy navigation.

Great Product for part time developers, students, hobbiests working
with a variety
of languages, or simply
maintaining a few small projects. Even after I converted
to ZDE, I still used UltraEdit for maintaining the websites I host for
friends and
family since the SFTP support was so much stronger, a task that has fallen
onto
Coda since my conversion to MacOS X.

Zend Development Environment - Good development environment. You pay for the

JVM, converting from a program as responsive
as UltraEdit this is something you
really feel. But once the app is up and your files are loaded you get very
aggressive
code completion, it's there all the time (still beats Komodo) with hints and
tips
trying to help you get your code out. Support for PHPDoc encourages
developers to
code
well, since it not only provides code completion, but parses it for improved
tool-tips when calling that function in the future. Some really slick
features like
code-completion on PHP5 Soap objects (this blew my mind the first time I saw
it).
CVS & SVN support is a bit weak, you're forced to choose one over the other
on
an application wide setting (rather than project).

Great product for developers who just do PHP, built in debugger(/php
install) is a bit
limited but works out of the box without any tweaking. I still use ZDE when
working
with code my students present for things like Indent Code and the Code
Analyzer
which finds tonnes of bugs in their code (and often mine).

Komodo - Good development environment. Not a Java app (no JVM!), but a...
different approach. The application was written in XUL, ontop of the firefox
codebase.
Which likely has a bunch of limitations and problems for the development
team, but
what it means for you as a developer is that you can extend & tweak the
entire
IDE to make it suit your needs with JavaScript & python. Add custom actions
to
the toolbar, right click context menu, whatever you need. You have access to
all
of Komodo's features via do commands, or you can code your own from scratch.
These
can be added on an either application or project level. Komodo uses XDebug
to
handle debugging, which (since it's a free product) can be installed for
free on any
of your servers, the Komodo application uses a custom php.ini to add the
apropriate
extension to your local php install for a (hopefully) painless local
run. Code completion
and syntax highlighting isn't limited to PHP, Komodo supports most dynamic
languages,
it also understands that a .php document isn't just PHP, it's a multi
language buffer and
you get full support for HTML, JS & PHP in that document (as well as full
DOM support).

Great Product for programmers who are able to deal with code completion
that's
not quite as good as Zend Studio, but enjoy the ability to extend their
environment,
or the power tools like RxToolkit or the HTTP Inspector (not just another
packet
sniffer).


So, apart from the fact that I use all three, and have all three installed
(paralells & bootcamp)
Komodo is my top choice, then ZDE, then UE (but UE doesn't really have a
prayer, I'm in the
wrong OS).

Your end table code is in the wrong place.
Here is what your code is doing:
$col is set to 0

Your loop begins
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it starts a row
Image 1
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it ends the row
increments $col to 1
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it isn't so it does nothing.
Image 2
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is not
increments $col to 2
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it isn't so it does nothing.
Image 3
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is not
increments $col to 3
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it isn't so it does nothing.
Image 4
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is not
increments $col to 4
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it is so it sets $col to 0
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it starts a row
Image 5
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it ends the row
....

Your output is probably really strange, as follows:
<Table>
<tr><td>image1</td></tr>
<td>image2</td><td>image3</td><td>image4</td>
<tr><td>image5</td></tr>
<td>image6</td><td>image7</td><td>image8</td>

Frankly, it's a matter of luck on how those non row cells get displayed.

Move if($col == 0)... to the end of the loop, after $col = ($col == 4) ? 
0 : $col; and you should be all good.

Hi,

How do you access the first element of an array? I'm looking for
something like array_shift but without modifying the array.

look at &quot;each&quot;, it is a (mostly deprecate) form of array

Is it anything that $array[0] would not be able to get access to?

But again that modifies the array (it advances the cursor).

I guess I can write something myself:

function array_first($array) {
    foreach ($array as $element)
        return element;
}

The function `current($array)` should do the trick.  Make sure you do  
so before trying to loop through the array or anything. ;-)

Hi Jon,

Nope. The 0 element is not necessarily first. Consider the following example:

$array = array();
$array['first'] = 'foo';
$array[] = 'bar';

$ ./t.php
Array
(
    [first] => foo
    [0] => bar
)

In this case the element 'foo' is first.

How about this:

$values = array_values($array);
$first = $values[0];

Yes, that would work. But building a new array is potentially very
expensive. So far the following is the best I can think of:

function _array_first($a, $want_key=FALSE) {
    foreach ($a as $key => $elem)
        return $want_key ? $key : $elem;
    return FALSE;
}

Or just reset before using it.
|reset($array);
echo current($array)

yjanks, but that did not work, it created a 1 column table

Your end table code is in the wrong place.
Here is what your code is doing:
$col is set to 0

Your loop begins
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it starts a row
Image 1
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it ends the row
increments $col to 1
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it isn't so it does nothing.
Image 2
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is not
increments $col to 2
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it isn't so it does nothing.
Image 3
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is not
increments $col to 3
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it isn't so it does nothing.
Image 4
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is not
increments $col to 4
Checks $col to see if it is 4, it is so it sets $col to 0
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it starts a row
Image 5
Checks $col to see if it is 0, it is so it ends the row
....

Your output is probably really strange, as follows:

image1
image2image3image4
image5
image6image7image8

Frankly, it's a matter of luck on how those non row cells get displayed.

Move if($col == 0)... to the end of the loop, after $col = ($col == 4) ? 
0 : $col; and you should be all good.

Hey, i'm kinda new around here and just tinkering around with php. My
question to you guys is how did you learn? by reading or by taking apart
scripts and adding your own style or what? I'm very curious.

Hmmm I dunno, if that was more towards "what was the way to access  
the first element of a hash?" I would say ok, but Im still convinced  
most would see an "array" as an object numerically indexed.

But current() it is :-)  Time to rewrite all those PHP books ...

On a side note to why the example does not work as expected - (I  
think it came up on the list way back):

The docs do not specify this, but adding to the array using the  
brackets syntax:
      $my_array[] = $new_value;
will not advance the internal pointer of the array. therefore, you  
cannot use current() to get the last value added or key() to get the  
key of the most recently added element.

Again, reset changes the array. The cursor is part of the array's
state such that calling it at an arbtrary location within your code
could change the logic of the application.

I set out to accomplish a project and then try things out. It helps if 
you know the basics of HTML as that is what you need to display things 
(assuming you use a web browser, which is the easiest way). It also 
helps if you know some of the really basic programming terms, such as 
variable, string, if...then (else if even what I consider a bit more 
advanced), loops, etc.

I look through the command list on php.net and often find something that 
fits. My first project was collecting form data and writing it to a text 
file. Then I set out to create a self-replicating script to create pages 
to view pictures dynamically. Then I started looking at using MySQL. 
Then I created an MP3 archiving and playing app, then I tried creating a 
CRM system (which turned out to be to tought for me at the time). Now 
I'm working on an even better picture and video archiving and viewing app.

Pick something that you have a use and interest in. Then figure out what 
this gizmo is supposed to do. Then figure out how to implement each 
feature. Write many comments into your script, that helps me to 
understand what I did and plan what I need to do.

Of course, you can get a book from the library and read that. You can go 
to http://w3schools.com/php/default.asp and get a first primer. And then 
just keep on digging and searching the web and driving PHP experts crazy 
on mailing lists with all your questions.

Oh, and bring some time and patience, it won't happen overnight and also 
not by next week, but I am sure that by next week you can do things you 
never ever thought you could do. That is the magic of PHP.


Good luck!

David

I guess you missed my earlier post. This is what I'm using right now:

function _array_first($a, $want_key=FALSE) {
    foreach ($a as $key => $elem)
        return $want_key ? $key : $elem;
    return FALSE;
}

> And btw, when you write that function, pass the array by reference, not by

With the above function I don't think it is necessary to pass by
reference because the array state is not modified and the array is not
returned from the function so it should not copy (I'm not positive
about this - I would be curious to know if someone had the definitive
answer on this scenario).

Back in the day I actually rewrote most of the phpGACL database
structure and reskinned the 'wicked confusing' interface.  Unfortunately
the project I was planning to use it for never eventuated.

It has some definite strengths, not the least of which is that it is
seriously fast at answering questions like 'can user X perform action Y
on object Z?' due to the MPTT database structure, and the use of caching.

I dug up my tests from 2005, and on my P4 2.8 laptop with 1GB ram and a
5400rpm hdd, the average query time was 0.05s.  That is with no caching,
on a random database with 1,000 ACLs, 1,000 ACOs, 100,000 AROs, 1,000
ARO groups, 100,000 AXOs and 1,000 AXO groups.  If you want to do your
own performance testing the system ships with an included benchmarking
suite.

It isn't as quick at answering questions like 'who can perform action Y
on object Z?', 'which actions can user X perform on object Z?', or
'which objects can user X perform action Y on?'.  However, I don't know
of any quicker solution which supports the level of granularity it does.

I do believe that cakephp at least borrows some of the concepts, though
I'm not sure of that. Nate?

At the time I stopped active contribution to the project, the 2 main
things I wanted to add were:

1. The ability to support multiple 'root' ARO/AXO elements.

Currently the system requires a single 'root' node in each of these
trees.  Usually this is just a placeholder without any real use, but it
would be possible to add the ability to support multiple root nodes
which would be a neat way to partition the system and should yield a
speed increase.

2. Consolidation of the ARO and AXO system into a single tree.

Currently if you want to have permissions like 'user X can edit user Y',
you must have all your users and groups in both ARO and AXO trees.  It
would be much simpler to just have objects, groups and permissions.

If anyone were interested in implementing these features, I would be
more than happy to answer any questions.  Who knows, maybe the bug will
bite again and I'll implement them myself!

The first place to start is the PHP manual. Definitely read the first 5
chapters all the way through.

Here are a couple more sites that I have used extensively in the past.
http://phpbuilder.com/columns/
http://melonfire.com/community/columns/trog/archives.php?category=PHP

Remember, there are a lot of articles and code that were written for PHP4
that will look and act different for PHP5. Also running v.4 on a v.5 server
could open you up to security vulnerabilities. Make sure you concentrate on
recognizing the differences. http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.migration5.php

I followed pretty much the same path as John, but I also used Kate and
the Kate-powered editors in the KDE environment. I really enjoyed
working with bluefish.

On the mac, I caved in to peer pressure and tried TextMate - however
I'm finding that Smultron is free and feels a LOT like the
quick-and-dirty editor I've always wanted; and if I need a lot of
features (class browser, integrated remote svn, etc) then I grab a
clean install of eclipse and then add the Aptana plugin.

I had a project that was failing bigtime, and had to fire the
developer that I'd hired to do the work. He'd chosen to do the work in
PHP, and since I have this masochistic tendency to spend all my time
cleaning up other's messes, I taught myself.

By the time I was done with that one project I was already pining for
new features and such, as this was the early years (I think around
1997, 1998). Back then I was mostly writing apache modules in c, and a
lot of PL/SQL...

Your approach depends on your existing experience, and your
personality and learning style. I learn by doing, and have been doing
this longer than most of my coworkers have been out of diapers. Others
may work differently, and want an example, or a book, or even a class.

Just like all other languages, there are nuances of performance,
security and such that can only be learned by doing. So rolling up
your sleeves and diving in might be the fastest way to get you on the
road, so to speak.

Welcome :)

There's no substitute for hands on learning.   Find a project that 
scratches an itch - a todo list application or CD inventory system for 
example - and try to build it yourself.  When you run into issues hit 
Google, read the manual or source code of an existing, similar program.

Personally, my watershed for 'getting' PHP was to take a 2 or 3 day class 
with one of the folks on this list about 5 years ago.    This got me set 
up with a development environment (Zend Studio), a basic set of tools 
(phpMyAdmin, local copy of the PHP manual), and a list of resources to 
consult for questions or existing solutions (phpclasses.org).

If you're specifically looking for things to read first, check out the 
list Carlos Hoyos and I put together last year.  It's showing its age, but 
most of the concepts and resources are still relevant:

But...what are you trying to accomplish? Tinkering? Developing an application?
When I started, regretfully, there really weren't any frameworks. Now I'm in
way over my head and constantly debate the merits of switching to a framework
versus hobbling along with my own "framework".

For tinkering, sure, learn and play with php. This is a wicked cool tool:
http://www.hping.org/phpinteractive/
Install it, play with it, experiment with code snippets in it. Instant feedback.

But if you want to develop a full-bore application, please don't roll your own
-- learn a framework while you are learning php.

Mself included. After all the discussion about frameworks, I've decided to 
stick to what
I'm doing and continue to refine my toolbox/framework. It works well, and I 
still don't see
how switching will save me development time.

Anyways, I learned when my first coding job demanded I write code in PHP. 
Until then,
I only had experiance in C & VB, both of which I learned by reading and 
doing.

So, I would say, "lots of book reading and code writing got me started".
I also did a few vaporware GPL apps to get started.
People don't really care how much you have to learn still, when your coding 
for free, so long
as you deliver working code on time. = ]

Hello,

I used to use emacs w/php mode, but as I got to be working with more and 
more files,
I needed an IDE and I moved to Komodo.

I love it, never looked back!

That's the best way to learn: by throwing yourself into the deep end of 
the pool, hopefully on a project for yourself, not a client.

I started programming with 6502 assembler.  My initial deep-end project 
was reprogramming the fader ballistics for my recording studio's 
console, which was automated by an Apple II.

I've learned six languages, not including SQL, programming the same 
tree-structured BBS in my spare time: 8088/86 assembler, AT&T "portable 
C", Tandem BASIC, C++, Perl and eventually PHP.  One of these days I'll 
finish it.

I started by inheriting a project that need some major rewrites done to 
it, it was written in this funny little language called Net.Data. 

Net.Data was a web CGI language geared to allow you to connect to a DB2 
database, process data, and format it for the web.  And it allowed you 
to intermix your HTML and Net.Data code in the same file.

After completing that, I was wondering how one would write the same 
thing in a non-IBM environment, so I got myself a Web Provider that 
supported everything at the time and looked into different ways of doing 
things.

PHP was a natural transition from Net.Data and for the most part 
painless.  The only real difference was PHP had a lot more power since 
it wasn't limited to being designed to interoperate with DB2 and than 
grudgingly extended to meet the needs of specific clients.

A couple years after that, IBM end of lifed Net.Data.  I mentioned that 
rewriting the app would be trivial in PHP, we went partially down that 
road and then gave up due to politics(the application was going to be 
replaced that year with the new application)......6 years later and 
their still running that application, on hardware that is failling, and 
with a backup that is completely useless(you can't get Net.Data to 
install on a new system anymore).

Don't forget ... probably the one best thing to take advantage of is  
the vast enormous amount of video screencasts + other free elearning  
material.  There was literally none of it (or it was ridiculously  
expensive) when I started and it has helped alot of people I know  
(and I think Rails benefited hugely from developer committed videos) ...

Hi Anthony:

I learn by doing.  When I run into issues, I consult the PHP manual, 
online tutorials, existing scripts that do similar things, deja news (now 
groups.google.com) archives of the php.general mailing list, the 
php.general mailing list -- generally in that order.

Hi Ken,

I appreciate your help but I don't have a lot of time for games. After
reading the manual for each() I see nothing to indicate that using
each() w/ reset() would be superior to the foreach() method I've been
using. The each() function already accepts references and AFAIK
runtime pass-by-reference is being deprecated anyway. Also, even if
there is something that would preserve the state of the array cursor,
that would suggest that a copy of the array would be made which could
be potentially very slow.

I'd very willing to accept direction as I spend a lot more time
writing C than I do PHP but I have to admit sometimes I have trouble
reading between the lines. If you still care to help please spell it
out for me why each() w/ reset() is superior to the foreach() method
I've been using.

Thanks,
Mike

Hmm...
I looked into pricing.
To upgrade from my previous copy of Komodo Personal to Komodo 4.1 costs 195.

A full license is 295.

So it's in the range of what I would expect for a decent IDE 
environment.  I'll give their trial a try and see if it meets my needs 
or not.

If it can get me off of windows it will be well worth it(as than my 
requirements for a dev machine drop substantially)

My first experience programming in PHP was writing my own online guest book.
Gets to you used to interfacing with a database (or flat file) and working
with user input. After getting a taste of the syntax, take a gander at
Object Oriented Programming in PHP and the many security issues that crop up
when handling user input. Keep the php.net function list handy and you

Hi Jake,

There is a book called "PHP and MySQL Web Development", which contains a DVD, It is good in so much as it teaches using a specific project devised by the authors.

You're absolutely right. Holy moly, there's books - books and books
and books, so many good ones that there are probably too many to read.

Here's a trick that I learned early on. Go into a bookstore, and check
out the existing PHP books that they have. Look at the reading style,
read a couple pages from each, just to see if one writing style is
easier for you to understand and so on. Then compare whether the books
you like more happen to come from a common publisher. There's a chance
that they do.

For example, I know people that love O'Reilly books, others that love
WROX, and I personally enjoy the Apress books. You might find a
particular publisher, author or writing style that you prefer as well.

Books are good :-)

Speaking of books, if you like OReilly books and can deal with online 
copies, you can purchase a months sub to read all their books online for 
the cost of 1 hardcopy book.

I find it more cost effective as I use a book and than am done with it 
for quite a while.

Even better than that, you can go to Safari on the Premier Club at www.devx.com and for $15.00/month have access to thousands of books.  You can have 10 books available at any one time.

I keep some PHP books and some MySQL ones, and an Ajax book and one on Javascript, and of course a Photoshop book, on my Bookshelf and wander over to Devx when I need to look up some syntax or look for a better way to do something.

What's wonderful is that there's beginning books AND complex books, so you can start out with how-to books and advance to more complex programming.

For me, I love the books that take you through setting up some code with explanations for each segment of code, and have you work through the example and write the code as you go, rather than the books that "discuss" how to do something, and there's plenty of these types of books there.

I found, for me, the 10 book bookshelf was just a little too limiting.

You have to keep a book on the bookshelf for a month before you can 
rotate it off.

I prefer their unlimited plan with no rotation.  That way when I need 
one chapter from one book, I get it and am done with it.

Disclaimer: I'm a minor contributor to the Quanta community and a happy user.

Quanta does code folding, FTP and SSH (using KIO slaves), supports
multiple programming languages, has project mangement / team features,
works with a debugger like XDebug and is completely customizable from
scripts, to toolbars, and full-blown wizards.

For example, I configured it so that it can 'natively' speak the XML
dialect for 'TaskJuggler' which is a Linux Project Management tool.

It has code completion (plus local documentation for PHP, MySQL,
JavaScript, CSS), structure browser, a terrific CSS editor built-in.
http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/resources.php

It does XSLT, DocBook and XML.

Local plugins (provided) such as Tidy, Linkchecker, and Konsole are
just examples of using the extensibility of the system.  It integrates
CVS too through Cervisia (but not yet Subversion -- just because
Cervisia doesn't do Subversion).   You can certainly build in a
subversion toolbar yourself due to the flexibility and extensibility
of the system.

Quanta (the editor part) is based on Kate.  Current development is
progressing on merging/aligning the project with KDevelop
http://www.kdevelop.org/ for KDE 4

I've been looking at Eclipse, not for any lack in Quanta, but rather
because I manage a cross-platform development team.  Eclipse would be
available on any desktop while Quanta is only available for Linux.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Two part question: Shopping carts & E-commerce
Message-ID: <005c01c7e915$4860ffd0$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello All, 

So, I've been asked by a client to implement a shopping cart into a php/mysql site that we built.
They want to start with about 12 items and have the shop interface w/miva, cart32 or shopsite.

I know nothing about those merchant accounts, if that's even what they are. Any insight
on those would be great.

Now, I LOVE reinventing the wheel on the first go, to better understand stuff. It also
enables me to build up my code library. And as far as time frame and budget, I 
could build a cart from scratch. 

I have the Apress book  "PHP5 & E-commerce", plus all the obvious online resources.

Is it a wise idea to build the cart from scratch? If so, what are some obvious pitfalls I should
be aware of? I'm not even 100% sure what parties are involved in an ecommerce transaction.

I will also need to construct some sort of admin side of this application to manage inventory, etc.

If I don't build the cart from scratch, what are some alternatives? I need it to be totaly skinable
if its a 3rd party solution. I'm sure joomla or drupal have ecommerce modules.

Let me hear from success stories!

Thanks!

- Ben

These are carts, not merchant accounts or gateways, so I?m confused.

>And as far as time frame and budget, I could build a cart from scratch. I have

No, no, no!!! A cart can be deceivingly complex. I used the same book as a
sort of ?Framework? for a tangential project that is cart-like. The three
layer architecture is great, but upside down. The presentation layer selects
the business logic ? go figure. Plus, it covers maybe 20% of what?s really
required.

> Is it a wise idea to build the cart from scratch?
NO. See above.

There are a gazillion carts ? both open source and commercial .Even the
commercial are dirt cheap. Another alternative is a hosted solution. You?ve
got to have a really, really good reason to develop a cart from scratch.

The big open source cart is oscommerce, which has a reasonably good fork
called Zencart. X-cart is a good commercial alternative. The code is a
nightmare, and will make any oop purist barf, but very easy to hack and
skin. There?s numerous others. First, figure out the budget and
requirements. That will wittle down the list.

Re: [nycphp-talk] Two part question: Shopping carts & E-commerceHello Cliff, 

hah, ok, that's convincing enough.

The budget and timeframe are both in my favour, so I can choose the best tools for the job.

Since I've yet to work w/joomla, would it be a good idea to try to set that up for e-commerce.
I remember a few days back, an answer to my Framework question, some responding saying
they had great success with joomla & e-commerce.

miva, cart32 or shopsite are carts? I didn't know that. I guess that's what THEY (the client) want to use.
Any experiance with those?

Im googling right now and it says miva is a merchange account as well.
http://smallbusiness.miva.com/products/merchant/
and shopping cart software
http://smallbusiness.miva.com/

Hmm..cart32 is windows based, so that's out!

Shopsite: looking at their website.

I guess I need to read up on the e-commerce and shopping cart basics. Do some carts only
work with certain merchants?

Now I am confused... Do you want to write your own, or do you want to
use cart32/shopsite?

Please provide an example site with a cart system you like, and I can
tell you what needs to be done.  Right now it appears you are really
confused about the process.

Please DO NOT write your own.

Below is one example of how complicated things get:
Cart has two items.  One is available for shipment today, one is
backordered.  What credit card transactions are you supposed to
process and when?  If you don't know the answer to that, you have no
business rolling you own.

Joomla is a CMS, it really has nothing to do with e-commerce however
it is common to integrate cart software with a CMS.

They will not work with a PHP site.  Most Cart software is pretty much the same.

> http://smallbusiness.miva.com/products/merchant/
> and shopping cart software

I know it is a bit confusing because terms like "Merchant Account" and
"Gateway" mean two different things depending on what you are doing...

There are two options:
1) Have a 3rd party charge the cards and they give you the funds
(PayPal/Google Checkout/Miva Merchant)
2) Charge the cards  on your own site -- You need a merchant bank
account with Chase, and a payment gateway.

Before you go any further, which route does you client want to go?
There is a big difference.

Hello,

Great points.

Both the client and myself don't know too much about this.
I guess I'll have to do more research before I can say.

Thanks, I'll look into this.

Re: [nycphp-talk] Two part question: Shopping carts & E-commerceBen, if you are interested in rolling your own cart and are willing to spend $9 on ordering PHP Architect back issues, there is a detailed explanation of building your own feature-rich cart in an article that I wrote for PHP Architect, The Ultimate PHP 5 Shopping Cart, spanning Aug. and Sept. 2004. The article includes a detailed explanation of merchant account fundamentals, credit card gateways, verification algorithms as well as step-by-step instructions to building your own cart.

By the way, what did you think of MySQL camp? Everyone there was great, but the presentations by Jay and Jeremy were definitely the highlight in my opinion...

Ben,
A lot can go wrong altogether if you have little experience with ecommerce.
Even if you use an off the shelf shopping cart.  If this client is expecting
high volumes in the future, you may want to do your research wisely
regarding security.  In fact, you may want to consider subcontracting that
portion of the project out, and try to learn as much about the process from
the subcontractor so that you can accomplish it by yourself on the next run.

I tried Quanta, and it was ok.  I've tried many of the others mentioned 
as well.  My favorite still stands as Eclipse PDT.  Yes, the eclipse 
'way' - workspaces - takes a bit of getting used to, especially as I 
used to work directly on a remote dev server instead of using local 
directories, but working locally is just so much faster.

It has incredible Subversion / CVS integration
Trac / Bugzilla Integration is very good using an interesting plugin 
called mylyn - which integrates your tickets with your revision control 
to auto-write your checkins (also shows tickets in actual ide).  Also 
does tons for managing current tasks.  HIGHLY recommend it.
Solid ANT integration for automated deployment
Built-in PHP debugging works great.
XDebug debugging works great as well (though a bit annoying to install 
since it's unpackaged)
Weak Bazaar integration, but the Bazaar devs are working on it
PHPDoc Support
PHP Explorer shows your object / function tree (shows includes and 
interface / parent classes in the tree as well)
Proper Code Coloring and even completion for everything - even in the 
same file - php, html, css, js

And, of course, vim when working over ssh.

The O'Reilly book PHP Hacks has a couple articles on Shopping Carts and 
payment gateways in it.

It is primarily the checkout process where Carts get tricky, especially 
if you use the Paypal process and especially if you are selling digital 
content(when do flag an item as sold? Paypal can take up to a day to 
actually process the charge. How do you deal with chargebacks and 
cancellations?  How do you reconcile the amount charged vs the amount 
that should have been charged?  Paypal is an ugly hack because your 
actually having the client system send the charge to paypal, so a smart 
individual can intercept the redirect and change the amount charged from 
$100 to 1 penny.  Though to be honest, the bulk of non paypal charge 
systems also do the same - have the client send the total to the server 
which then processes what the client sent.

It really depends on how much time and effort you want to put into 
having the program do a lot of checking compared to having a human check 
the order and verify the prices and quantities. 

Joomla has Virtuemart which works well if you have a content heavy site 
where you want to do a few sales.  OSCommerce works well for a heavy 
sales site with low content.  Of course, never underestimate just using 
something off the shelf.  A lot of web providers have a cart script they 
provide for free and deals with merchant accounts for charging.  Also if 
I recall correctly, Amazon let's you sell products through them, so you 
can build your cart and everything on your site, but send the cart for 
checkout  to Amazon and let them deal with payment gateways and 
chargebacks and such.

Look at this thread:
http://www.scriptygoddess.com/archives/2006/12/28/cube-cart-vs-zen-cart/

The ZenCart site also has some good comp data.

This: http://www.cs-cart.com/ is like a next-gen x-cart.

Most carts support many gateways and payment methods. The gateway is what
matters, not the merchant account, other than some specialized ones like
google, paypal, etc.

Not so much a merchant, but a payment gateway(and I consider Google and 
Paypal gateways).

Also there is the issue of the way payment is supposed to work, and how 
most people do it.

Supposedly:

A)Client puts 100$ worth of products in their cart
B)Client goes to checkout
C)Charging information collected from client
D) Charging information submitted to gateway for APPROVAL
E) Charge result processed
E1) Denied?  Go to step C
E2) Success?  Tell client so
F) You ship the products
G) You mark the item as shipped in the system
H) The system contacts the payment gateway and has the funds released


It's a two step process, Authorize the charge, than Release the funds 
after shipping

In the real world, most companies seem to do it in 1 step, Authorize and 
Release - which you can do but is a legal liability(what happens if a 
tornado comes through and destroys the warehouse before it shipped?  You 
HAVE to provide the product since you took the money, a refund is not 
good enough).

Payment Gateways work in one of two ways:
1) You collect all the payment information on your server and submit it 
through an SSL session to the gateway for approval.
2) You send the client to the payment gateway with some hidden fields 
for the products and pricing and they pay there, than the gateway 
returns the client to your site, as well as hitting it's own secret 
callback url to notify you a payment has been approved

A long long time ago, Paypal was strictly a remote gateway, you would 
redirect the client to paypal, they would process the payment.

Nowadays Paypal has an extremely inexpensive option for doing payment 
approvals yourself without a client redirect - the catch is that you 
must also accept paypal and must provide a process for this, so you need 
to implement 2 payment methods for Paypal(that said, a number of 
companies use the Paypal payflow method and don't advertise/allow direct 
paypal payments in violation of their agreement).

It also gets really complicated when your dealing with stores located in 
other countries.  Paypal won't provide gateway services for many 
countries, and in those countries gateways that will provide such 
service charge an arm and a leg(and considering that developers from 
those countries tend to be very cagey about saying what country they are 
in, my own feeling is those fees are justified.  I know of at least 2 
companies completely run out of India with Florida LLC's in order to use 
Paypal)

I generally work backwards with a cart system, first I determine what 
payment gateways(Paypal, Authrorize.net, Worldpay, linkpoint, etc) are 
preferred, than find a cart that supports that gateway.  If they don't 
know what they want, than I recommend paypal until they decide what they 
want(a lot of merchant accounts charge hefty monthly fees, setup fees, 
and percentages - so make sure to setup the gateway first - working 6 
weeks on the project only to have the client refuse to implement because 
those "thieves" want 100$ application fee, 30$ a month, and 4% of sales 
is frustrating.  Paypal is cheap, it works, and it looks 'chintzy'.  It 
is amazing how many objections to Paypal disappear when they find out 
the costs of different system).

Speaking of Linux editors, are there any editors which can recognize and 
import a Dreamweaver taglist?

I was recently doing some work on ProStores and they had a dreamweaver 
taglist for their ugly little scripting language.  I would have loved to 
be able to edit their pages in an editor I am more comfortable 
with(well, I DID edit their pages in an editor I was more comfortable 
with, I just did not have the time to build my own tag library for it)

Message-ID: <C2F99261.7397%cliff@pinestream.com>

Does Nyphp have any polling capability?

It would be interesting to see how many of us are actually using Frameworks,
and if so, what Frameworks we are using. (Might want to throw in JavaScript
libraries like jQuery, Prototype, etc too). If we can?t do a poll, perhaps
just a wiki or passing this email around with a list of frameworks and
initials for each responder.

Cliff

P.S. If Mark Withington is listening, the Bostonphp web site has polling
capability ? perhaps he can set something up for everyone.

I'm not thrilled with Google checkout since it requires you to have your 
customer setup a Google account(I think Amazon requires an amazon 
account, but the process just appears more streamlined and felt like 
setting up a shipping/billing subcomponent of the account rather than 2 
accounts).

Ya know, one thing that wasn't mentioned, just what ARE these 10 
products they plan on selling?

Let me explain a bit.

If your selling photo's or photo related items(a poster, postcards, etc) 
- a saner solution could be to use Menalto Gallery and use their built 
in hooks to the various photo printing services.  You define your 
products, the markups, etc in the printer service, and than just setup 
the online digital photos.  You can even have 2 versions of the file on 
your site, one that is publicly viewable and one high quality one the 
photo service will use.

If your selling stuff with emblazoned logo's, tote bags and junk, a lot 
of people use CafePress for that, and you can build your own interface 
into it to the degree you need it(from redirecting to a skinned 
cafepress store, to embedding the iutems inside your site but using 
their checkout, to having your own checkout and than you submit the 
order to cafepress and have it drop shipped to the customer).

If your selling digital content, there is a whole slew of issues to 
think through regarding downloads and such.

Using Eclipse do you map your local directories to a web server? 
Do you save your local files in a browser accessible folder?

I tried Quanta, and it was ok.  I've tried many of the others mentioned 
as well.  My favorite still stands as Eclipse PDT.  Yes, the eclipse 
'way' - workspaces - takes a bit of getting used to, especially as I 
used to work directly on a remote dev server instead of using local 
directories, but working locally is just so much faster.

It has incredible Subversion / CVS integration
Trac / Bugzilla Integration is very good using an interesting plugin 
called mylyn - which integrates your tickets with your revision control 
to auto-write your checkins (also shows tickets in actual ide).  Also 
does tons for managing current tasks.  HIGHLY recommend it.
Solid ANT integration for automated deployment
Built-in PHP debugging works great.
XDebug debugging works great as well (though a bit annoying to install 
since it's unpackaged)
Weak Bazaar integration, but the Bazaar devs are working on it
PHPDoc Support
PHP Explorer shows your object / function tree (shows includes and 
interface / parent classes in the tree as well)
Proper Code Coloring and even completion for everything - even in the 
same file - php, html, css, js

And, of course, vim when working over ssh.

Short...
Yes, but a local server.
Yes.

Long...
Locally I'm running apache2 and set up each project as a virtualhost 
subdomain, like
project1.example.com
project2.example.com
project3.example.com
project4.example.com
and so on and then update my hosts file to point those subdomains to 
localhost.

My directory stucture looks something like this
/home/example/www/com/project1
/home/example/www/com/project3
/home/example/www/net/project2
/home/example/www/org/project4

Also, I have a similar setup on my win32 box.
D:\W\com\project1
D:\W\com\project3
etc...

Each folder is an eclipse project, and I have bazaar (or subversion) 
ignore the eclipse files (.project, .settings, .cache, etc).  I don't 
use Eclipse's workspace directory for anything project-related.

As for how they map to the live sites, they don't in any specific way.  
Each project has a different directory structure due to differing 
servers/needs.  I handle those differences in configuration files.

Be very very cautious with those providers.

I'm just wrapping up a project with ProStores(please let me be wrapping 
this up and nothing new thrown in) and my experience there has been 
painful, to say the least.

Part of it is the odd configuration of the server that is not up to 
ProStores but the reseller.

And part of it is the odd little language they have to use with their 
services.  (Now granted, they do have an XML API that can let you do 
quite a lot outside of their structure).

It didn't help that I came into it cold after the previous group fell 
down on a number of things they felt they could do.

I like things under my control.....(yeah, I suggested Amazon and 
CafePRess, but they have some good API's you can integrate to)

Why not just put up a poll ourselves? There are tons of frameworks
available that would make such an effort an easy one. We would just
need to pick one and get going...

Not currently, but it's something we should do.  There's actually some
discussion today on the NYPHP-Org list about the next nyphp.org site.  While
sure, we could throw something up using a framework, we like pain (ie, we
like to develop).  We're going to start up a community based nyphp.org
revision (which is how the current nyphp.org was developed) which is fun for
people to get involved in, etc.  After all, half the fun is getting there,
right?

I think we should have nyphp.org implemented using as many different
frameworks as possible, and that each request should by handled by a
different, random framework.

But maybe that's just me.

Brilliant!! And each will have separate implementations for each 
database (mysql, postgres, oracle, xml, couchdb, etc) and then each of 
those for each OS (linux, windows, palm, hacked wii, etc) and we'll name 
each framework/database/os implementation according to our favorite 
beers, which we'll pick according to our ruby-poll.

The example shows a query of a table, not XML.  The purpose is to 
demonstrate with a quick snippet that all examples of a supposed 
indispensable need for the "XML Database" stem from an ignorance of the 
abilities of other tools.

Say that you prefer XML, say that you like it, say that you are used to 
using it, but don't say that it is a fundamental requirement of the data 
itself because it just ain't so.

My observation on your arguments stems from your repeatedly ignoring 
obvious examples of where tables do just fine to store data, and the 
claim that 80% of the world's apps need an XML database.

If you have gotten used to using XML for text, then say so.  If you like 
it, then say so.  Don't say it is the only tool available because it is 
not.  It has many very serious drawbacks, verbosity being the very 
first, not to mention the confounding of structure and implementation, 
encouraging the illusion of "structureless" data, and so on.

I do know you, and that is why I was struck by your pro-XML stance for 
"80% of applications", in which you must either be ignorant of what most 
applications really need, or what modern RDBMS's can do, or both. 

Forget about EF Codd and the relational model for a moment, lets just 
look at the real products that have come along, the table-based servers 
we call RDBMS's.  These have all solved the very basic issues of data 
storage.  Most of their power comes from so-called "ACID" compliance, 
the ability to allow multiple simultaneous users to access a data store 
with assurances of predictable behavior.  Your XML databases must solve 
these same issues.

What about security?  The modern RDBMS defines security on all objects. 
Your XML databases will have to provide the ability to define security 
on the complete tree. (By the way, I'm sure they'll get there, just keep 
reading).

But there is one aspect of the relational model where XML, as a format, 
takes a huge leap backward.  Codd realized the incredible productivity 
gains that could be had if a programmer could access data by name and 
not worry about its internal storage structure.  He separated the 
implementation from the interface.  XML, as a format (file, data, 
whatever), confounds these two.  It is a verbose format for hierarchical 
data.  There are better formats for nearly all uses.

Here's the clincher.  Let's say the XML database grows up and has all of 
these things.  On this day the only thing it will have in common with 
XML is a hierarchical model, the XML format itself will be the first to 
go.  The ability to accept XQuery statements will be a historical 
footnote, and people will end up hating XQuery as much as they hate SQL 
(everybody's least favorite part of the RDBMS world).  These databases 
will end up supporting output formats as YAML, JSON, and others, and 
probably inputs as well.  There is just not a lot in the XML format that 
really makes up data storage.

We can thank XML for making us conscious of the ubiquitous need for 
hierarchical data.  I use it all of the time.  Personally  I store my 
database definitions in YAML, a hierarchical data format that is human 
readable/writable (unlike XML) as well as machine readable-writable.   
My programs return hierarchical data from AJAX requests as JSON, because 
that's what the browser works best with, and all of my PHP programs 
handle all data universally as associative arrays, which are just 
hierarchical data in yet another disguise.  I love hierarchies, but have 
not use for a format that is not human readable/writable, which is 
incredibly verbose, and which

So when I say you are arguing from ignorance, I am saying that you are 
generalizing your own experience with heavy-duty text management, and 
since you have never mentioned any of the topics above, you may not have 
the entire picture.

Now, to your point about my own limited experience, I picked a path some 
years ago that has made me an expert in some areas and ignorant in 
others.  But I don't go claiming that "80% of the worlds applications 
cannot use RDBMS".   In fact, the examples you raise are all examples of 
text management.  This is a new area that the RDBMS was never intended 
to solve.  Many people have found it easily possible to extend the RDBMS 
in a few areas, but others (such as you) are saying we need to start 
over.  But it is amusing that the look-again crowd has started over with 
hierarchical data.  In the end it won't be the format that is used, but 
the basic abilities to manage and store text.  I submit that the clear 
solution has yet to emerge from that pursuit.

But you are not saying what it is based upon.  My statements above about 
ACID compliance, security, and separation of implementation from 
interface provide a basis for a database.  The structure of the data is 
given by tables.  This makes a complete system.

If you cannot provide the basis for the entire picture of data 
management, we are left with what the XML books tell me: how to format 
the file.

???? Geez Rusty, come on.  My conclusion is worded harshly yes, but do 
you really label as a troll a description of the larger issues of 
formats, data models, and everything else that makes up the larger picture?

Actually most data does not, not at first glance.   But since a table is 
simply a mapping of properties to entities, it turns out that most data 
does when you look at it closely.  It takes about the same effort as 
deciding upon a set of tags, since it is of course exactly the same process.

The crucial question is, does your book have structure?  Can you make up 
tags as you go or are you limited to a pre-defined set, such as Docbook? 
  Once you commit to a specific set of tags, you have committed to a 
structure, and you may as well use tables as anything else.  Methinks 
however that at this point it comes down to what you are comfortable 
with.  If you want to use XML, go for it, if you want to use tables, go 
for it, just don't confuse the structure of the data with a fundamental 
need for either system.

Hello again,

I looked at shopify, seems cool but only supports google and paypal.
I dont *think* my client wants to use them. But I will double check.
I've worked with the paypal IPN system for subscriptions only.
Never with a cart or multiple items.

John Campbell asked which of the two options my client wanted to use:
I believe they want to use miva merchant to process the cards.

Now, I've read through all the emails and I still don't have a firm grasp
on how that works. I looked on wikipedia for a nice explanation of an
e-commerce transaction, but didn't find it. Anyone know of a graphical
flow chart style explanation with details on each parties responsiblity
and where they fit.

Anyways, the items they are selling are misc hardware items, for wells,
filters, bolts, etc. All tangible goods they will be shipping.

So, if I am to use miva merchant, where does the shopping cart come into
play? I'm assume I have to find a shoping cart that works with Miva 
merchant.

- Ben

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How to make a model/database accessible to different
 parts/classes of the application
Message-ID: <46D5D7B5.1090505@gmail.com>

Hey!

I have an MVC based application and I need to have access to my Model 
object in different parts of the application (controller, templates(read 
operations), view helpers, plugins ...). So I first thought of passing 
it to each class that needs it, however it's not very elegant to pass it 
to 6 classes until it arrives at a class that actually needs it.

So my second attempt was to create a singleton, but the problem is that 
my model needs configuration data in order to be instantiated correctly. 
So whenever I would call the getInstance(...) method I need to have the 
model's configuration data available as I can't always be sure that the 
getInstance method has been called before and an instance of the model 
class already exists. It also doesn't make sense to have a configurable 
singleton object as there is always one instance, no mater whether you 
pass different configuration data to it.

Last but not least I wanted to create a Registry class, add my model to 
it and access it from whatever method I want. This however makes unit 
testing harder and has all the site effects which global variables have.

So how do you handle your model/database object? What's the best way?

Thanks!

Jakob

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR CAPTCHA Problems
Message-ID: <036601c7ea8e$1aab2d70$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello, 

I've just written a class around the PEAR captcha code.

Except, I can't get it to work.
The code is included:

class Captcha
    {
        private $path;
        public  $error;
        function __construct($PATH)
        {
            $this->phrase = '';
            $this->image  = '';
            $this->width  = '';
            $this->height = '';
            $this->path   = $PATH;
            $this->error  = '';
        }
    
    
        function GenerateCaptcha($width, $height, $options=false)
        {
            if ( !$options ) $this->GenerateCaptchaOptions($options);
            $captcha = TEXT_CAPTCHA::factory('Image');
            $result  = $captcha->init($width, $height, null, $options);
            if ( PEAR::isError($captcha) )
            {
                return ($this->error = CAPTCHA_CREATE_ERROR);
            }

            $this->phrase = $captcha->getPhrase( );
            $this->image  = $captcha->getCAPTCHAAsJPEG( );
            if ( PEAR::isError($this->image) )
            {
                return ($this->error = CAPTCHA_IMAGE_ERROR);                
            }
            $this->width  = $width;
            $this->height = $height;

            $this->WriteCaptcha( );
            
            return $this;
        }
        
        
        function WriteCaptcha( )
        {
            $file = $this->path . md5($this->phrase) . '.jpg';
            file_put_contents($file, $this->image);     
        }
        
        
        function GetCaptchaFilename( )
        {
            return md5($this->phrase) . '.jpg';
        }
        
        
        function GenerateCaptchaOptions(&$options)
        {
            $options = array(   'font_size' => 32,
                                'font_path' => './',
                                'font_file' => 'arial.ttf'
                            );
        }
    }

As far as I can tell, its unable to write/create the file/image.

[29-Aug-2007 18:34:09] There was an error creating the captcha image

Is what I am getting in my PHP logs. Now the captcha directory is chmod 777, just to see if that
fixed it. It didn't. I also did a chown apache:blah captcha and that didn't work either.

The code I'm using to call the CAPTCHA is:

        $captchaObject = new Captcha(CAPTCHA_PATH);
        $captchaObject->GenerateCaptcha(400, 180);
        if ( $captchaObject->error != '' )
        {
            error_log($captchaObject->error);
        }
        $smartyObject->assign('captcha', $htmlObject->CreateImage(
            $captchaObject->GetCaptchaFilename( ), 300, 180, 'CAPTCHA'));

Now, if I print_r($captchaObject) I get:

    [error] => There was an error creating the captcha image
    [phrase] => chiaprae
    [image] => PEAR_Error Object
        (
            [error_message_prefix] => 
            [mode] => 1
            [level] => 1024
            [code] => 
            [message] => Error initializing Image_Text (font missing?!)I just copied this from the PEAR Apress book. Does anyone know where to get the font file,if that is indeed the error?- Ben

Hello Jon,

Yes I'm on centOS, I have no idea about fonts.
Where do I look.

I did a "locate arial.ttf"
and it found nothing.

Fonts should be in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/

You probably need to install mscorefonts and freetype.

Find a ttf file, any ttf file(if your using windows, take a look in your 
control panel->fonts folder

Upload it to the server and put it somewhere readable by your web program.

Set the options appropriately, ie:

|// Set CAPTCHA options (font must exist!)
$options = array(
    'font_size' => 24,
    'font_path' => './',
    'font_file' => 'COUR.TTF'
);

Where font_path is the full path to your font file
and font_file is your font file(make sure case matches!)

Make sure to pass your options to the functions that require them.


A little prayer couldn't hurt. :-)

(Captcha images are a royal PITA due to the font issues, ability to write to the correct directory, and whether or not you have GD or freetype or ImageMagick or whatever they want installed)

Sounds like you might find some answers in reading about Dependency  
Injection. I've come across this recently, and it's helped my  
thinking around some of these issues. http://www.martinfowler.com/ 
articles/injection.html I think the key here is the concept of the  
"container". It's like a class configuration registry.

There was also a good article about Dependency Injection in a recent  
php|architect issue:
http://www.phparch.com/issue.php?mid=82

The idea of implementing a generic container seemed a little overkill  
for most of what I was doing. I've found myself using static methods  
to configure a class (rather than a singleton), and I place my  
configuration code in a bootstrap file. For example, the bootstrap  
file might look something like:

require_once 'Proj/SomeModel.php';

Proj_SomeModel::configure(array(
    'option1' => 'some value',
    'option2' => 'another value',
));

The boostrap could either be a global one, or one that could be  
required only when I knew I was going to work with the model. The  
model object would then access these static config values within the  
constructor when instantiating itself. Using a model becomes a simple  
as:

Hello,

I did just as you stated. No luck.

I grabbed the file from windows and mac (.ttf) checked the path, tried a few
variations, and made sure the $options array had the values set before
passing to the function.

I want to say its a path issue, but I've tried both relative and absolute 
paths.

Any ideas?

Hello Ben,

All the captcha scripts that I have worked with either use an explicit
path to the specific font or the font has been in the same folder as
the script that calls it. In your example, the font would need to be
in the same folder as the script that sets up the options array, I
think.

HTH,

Hello Mike,

I did a print_r() on the object to see, and the path is correct.
I also did a chmod 777 on the arial.ttf file, plus tried to chown it as well
to apache. Nothing seems to work.

Here is the PEAR code where its failing:

      $this->_imt = new Image_Text(
            $this->_phrase,
            $options
        );

 if (PEAR::isError($this->_imt->init())) {
            $this->_error = PEAR::raiseError('Error initializing Image_Text 
(fo\
nt missing?!)');
            return $this->_error;

So, I hacked up the PEAR code to
 if (!PEAR::isError($this->_imt->init())) {

continue in case of an error, and it is generating the colored textbox image 
w/lines and circles
drawn on it, just no text.

Hmmm...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Why can't I create a second directory?
Message-ID: <46D6B68B.8090203@beezifies.com>

I have a complex little install script that creates directories and 
subdirectories and copies files.

It keeps failing on one providers server.

I boiled down the install script problems to the fact that it cannot 
create a subdirectory after creating a directory.

I made a simple test script, all it does is create one subdirectory, 
than create another inside the first.
I set the mode to 777 just to make sure the directory would be created 
completely unsecured(I will also note that does not happen, instead the 
directory is created as 755 which should STILL be acceptable since the 
script itself is the one creating both directories and thus should be 
the owner).

Any ideas on why the first case works and the second case does not?


$path = "/var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/httpdocs/j/components/com_test/";
$mode = 0777;
                if (!@mkdir(substr($path,0,-1),$mode)) {
                    die ("Cannot create ".substr($path,0,-1));
                }
                
$path = "/var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/httpdocs/j/components/com_test/test/";
$mode = 0777;
                if (!@mkdir(substr($path,0,-1),$mode)) {
                    die ("Cannot create ".substr($path,0,-1));
                }

Hi Gary, 

what does it complain about when you remove the error supression @s ? 

also, i'm curious, why are the calls to substr() necessary? 

does shelling out to mkdir work? 

 `mkdir -p /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/httpdocs/j/components/com_test/test`

is this a cli script, or one you trigger via apache?  what user is
running it & what exactly are the permissions?

It doesn't.  I am finding more and more web providers setup Apache to 
not give any error messages when something goes wrong.

This naturally makes it more difficult to troubleshoot the problem(and 
when they do not allow you command line access to run it manually in 
their environment...)

It removes the trailing slash on the directory, which for some servers 
is necessary.  Since it is done for both directories, that should not be 
the problem.

It's triggered by Apache.  Actually, it's triggered by Joomla running 
under Apache to create a directory.  I simply tracked down where it was 
creating those directories and removed the extraneous bits and 
consolidated it down to the problematic function call(mkdir).



Interestingly, I expanded my script somewhat to determine:
A) The uid running the script
B) The uid which owns the first directory(they are the same, so both own 
the same directory)
C) I added an explicit call to chmod to set the first directory to 777
(this BTW is frustrating me to no end.  I can't count the number of 
providers who do not place the  web server in the same group as the user 
invoked for PHP scripts.   Mind you, I'm not asking that the PHP scripts 
be in the same group as Apache, ie access to all files apache can 
access, I want Apache to be in the group of each PHP user therefore 
giving it access to any files PHP creates) This is in the interest of 
security - and I understand the security concerns, but the result is 
people using these servers end up needing to set the security of their 
own files to 777 to get around the server problems.  Which means that 
they end up running less secure in the name of security)

Hey all:

What advice/best practices can you guys share in regards to memory

and yes, i've upped the memory limit.  I need some method to clear out 
memory after each loop iteration... Any ideas?

Are you using http://php.net/imagedestroy to clear out the memory after
each iteration?

If you want a quick fix, just write the output file after processing
each file, and set the variable that stores the image to null.  This
should automatically happen if you reuse the same variables to store
the image.  I am curious to see how you coded this so the memory grows
with each additional image.

If it is a one time job, you should run the script from the command
line (no time limit, or memory limit).  This is not a realistic task
for a web request, if you want to implement background processing then
a scheduler/queue is the way to go.

That's probably were you're wrong: more often than not, the script will be 
running as the same user as the Apache process (after all, the Apache 
process hands off to the PHP module). So the script is running as "nobody" 
or "www" rather than the owner of the files.

If you have shell access and either image magick or magickimage, use 
shalbum.

Shalbum is FAST, has a lot of greate features, and zips through image files.

Technically, what it does is take a directory full of images, and a 
bunch of parms, and creates 2 new versions of each image(a thumbnail and 
a fullsize), places them all in a new set of directories, and creates a 
simple set of HTML pages to navigate between them as a photo gallery.

But I find it easy to use for practically anytime I need to create a 
couple hundred thumbnails and I don't want to have to deal with a PHP 
script timing out(if run over the web) or any other issues.

But if your script is running as "apache" or "nobody" or "www" then that 
chmod is gonna fail...

Though the latest Joomla upload process uses FTP now right?

Maybe your script can do the same?

Not an issue in this case, since the script is creating both 
directories.  No matter what user it is running as, it will be the owner 
of the directories since it is the one creating the directories.

(though just to be on the safe side, I did rewrite my script to print 
out the uid the script was running under, and the uid of the directory 
and they matched.   I also realized the reason I was getting 755 was due 
to the umask, so I just changed the initial permissions to minimal and 
added a call to chmod - that worked - as far as setting permissions.  
The dang second directory still won't create.  Heck, I even put a 2 
second delay between creations just in case the OS was being flaky )

More and more, I find I am spoiled with my current web provider.  I 
never have these problems with them.  Given that not being an option, 
give me a system I can have root on and can setup things myself.

I lost some hair over the same issue when trying to hack FsckEditor with 
image upload into a clients website hosted at hosting4less.com
The details are kind of vague, but I remember it having something to do 
a php SAFE MODE restriction on mkdir and the fact that the web server 
was running as a different user than that owned by the user.   I could 
create a directory, but not set the attributes for that directory. That 
prevented creating any futher subdirectories.

I tried all sorts of hacks to circumvent this, but with no satisfactory 
results.  The ISP does not provide shell access but I was able to get 
around the one-deep restriction by having the php script "ftp" into the 
server and do mkdir's. However, the directories were then owned by the 
user and not writable by the web server. Their ftp server restricted 
chowning or chmoding those to be world writable, so in the end, there 
was no way I could write files into the directories I created.

Good luck with a solution. I couldn't find one.

Thanks for all the suggestions.  I'm debugging it now and making sure i 
destroy everything.  I'd send you the code but it's huge.  Basically, 
I'm taking each photo and downsizing 4 ways per. Yes, 4.

I'll check out shalbum as well - sounds great.  But for this, there are 
associated DB calls and tons of other things I have to do.  Thanks again!

Yes, this was the error.  They turned off safe mode and now it is working.

Note: there was a specific note about safe mode causing problems with 
mkdir, but they specified it would also cause the chmod function not to 
work, and that it only occured if the directory owner differs from the 
directory creator.

Since I checked all those first, and chmod would work, I assumed it was 
somewhere else.

Thanks!

If you're not squeamish about shell calls and the OS supports it, try 
the -p option for /bin/mkdir.

Just out of curiosity, why not install Apache on your own box and see 
what the error message is? Is there anything special about that server 
that cannot be replicated locally?

Yes, it is not a matter of a non funcitoning program.  It was a program 
that would not function on that providers server.

I test programs on my own web provider where I can enable and disable 
the level of error messages and whether to send them to the screen or 
the logfile at will - and I have access to the error log.


Than I have fun trying to figure out what the provider does differently.

You know you can most likely use ini_set('display_errors', 1) combined 
with ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL) to get the errors to show up?

You don't.

If a document is available on the web server it can be downloaded.

If you provide a bit more background, there are tricks you can do with 
PHP to restrict access to files, but those files must NOT be publicly 
accessible, you basically make your php script the intermediary between 
the browser and the file.

Hello,

I'm still having CAPTCHA issues. Does anyone have experiance w/PEAR's 
CAPTCHA code
and has it working? I'd like to see some source code.

Otherwise, I might have to switch to a system that works.

Hello all,

After speaking with the client about their needs, this is what I gathered:
They are using the Royal Bank of Scotland, and the bank recommened
they use MIVA. They want to the transactions to go through their bank
as to keep their records all in one place.

So, what is the next step I need to do? What additional information
should I gather from the client?

You can put them out of the docroot for your webserver... but then  
they won't be accessible at all through your site.  You can wrap the  
files in a php script that checks for credentials to make sure a user  
has access to the file, but, and I have to explain this to clients  
all the time, when someone views a file on the web, the file is  
*downloaded* to their computer for it to be viewed.  There's no way  
to get around this.  The user might have to figure out how to get it  
from their cache, but there's no way to let someone view a file  
without it being transfered to their computer and therefore it's not  
possible to keep a person from saving the file somewhere if they're  
smart enough.

What is the product that's being sold?

Does it ship worldwide? How complicated is there shipping methods and 
rates? What about sales tax / VAT? Does it need to support special 
promotions and/or coupons?

Do they expect to manage products through a back-end application? What 
sort of features should that have? Any content management needed? 
Categories? News pages?

Yeah, e-commcerce is not so simple...

Hello again,

Products being sold are filters, nuts & bolts, etc.

Shipping is  local, new england area @ most.

Sales tax is not applicable in NH, where they are located.

I'm not sure how they plan to manage inventory.
I know they will need the ability to manage it however.

Joomla + VirtueMart can do all this quite easily.

Your client needs a gateway & merchant account.  If you want
authorize.net (as the gateway), then go to authorize.net and research
the resellers.  Make some recommendations to your client.  Have your
client call the reseller and set up an account.  Once that is done,
you will be good to go.  All you need is the authorize.net account
information.  Authorize.net is supported by pretty much every cart
software on the market.

Keep in mind that the credit card fees are all lies.  No matter what
rate they advertise, it will end up being more. If it says 2.5%, that
means 2.5% for a blue colored visa with no rewards program issued in
Guam.  Expect to pay %3.5 + .40 processing + $20-40/month for the
gateway + $25 for each charge back regardless of the outcome.

If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty, make sure you get a
cost-plus account. Meaning full-transparency where you get the actually
interchange rates plus the payment processor markup.

Can you get this service on turnover ~$300k? A couple of years ago I
looked and couldn't find anything.

Ben,

The wikipedia articles on "payment gateway" and "merchant bank" are
worth readying if you have not already.

Not sure. You can always say you're a startup and project millions :) A
little chutzpah goes a long way.

MIVA is an e-commerce application.  They'd have to buy it if they  
want to use it and then you'd have to figure out how to set it up on  
the web server and configure it.  They are books available on MIVA (I  
had a site a long time ago that an install of it setup by our hosting  
company for like $10 a month).

In order to enable online transactions, MIVA needs to be configured  
to connect to a "merchant account" with a bank.  It looks like from  
your statement that their merchant account is with Royal Bank of  
Scotland.

MIVA manages inventory and provides a pretty detailed admin interface  
to configure how all the pages are displayed and do some nice  
features like spotlight certain products, have special sales, etc.   
You'll probably just have to created a wrapper html template that it  
sits inside to integrate it with the rest of the site.

Assuming they have the money, I would recommend just buying whatever  
the bank recommends because it will probably end up being the least  
headache and would have the fastest turnaround time.
