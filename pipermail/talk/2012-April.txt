Newbie question: Does find-virus.php go in a separate file and is called from your main PHP file? How would you do that?

Hi Peter,

 

>Newbie question: Does find-virus.php go in a separate file and is called from your main PHP file? How would you do that?

 

Normally it should go to root of ftp site. Than when called from browser:

 

http:://www.mysite.com/find-virus.php it will scan all files recursively over all ftp site files.

 

Script will not check all files but only:

 

Main.html

Main.php

Index.html

Index.php

Login.html

Login.php

Default.html

Default.php

Home.html

Home.php

 

It will show to browser all files, I am trying to find file where it cleans also infected files. Clean should

Be very simple, infected file should be loaded into memory, used string replace ?base64?? with string ??

And save file.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

Hi Rob,

 

There can be several solutions to stop this injection:

-          In file upload form field, on submit should be checked is
uploaded file extension is .jpg,.gif,.bmp or .png with JavaScript

-          When file is uploaded it should be checked with GD graphics
library is it image

 

                                $path_info =
pathinfo($item->getValue("photo_filename"));

                                $extension = $path_info["extension"];

                                $fileName = $path_info["basename"];

 

http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagecreatefrompng.php

 

$tempImage = imagecreatefrompng("/./upload.png");

  /* See if it failed */

  If ($tempImage)

  {

 

-          File also can be checked with tool for extract meta data from
file

http://getid3.sourceforge.net/

 

-          Add .htaccess file with rules to not be able to execute files,
only read/write

Unfortunately I do not know how this happened; don't know if there is a huge

Our company wordpress blog was compromised a few months ago due to a
vulnerability in the "timthumb.php" image resizing script in one of the
themes.
http://www.terranetwork.net/blog/2011/08/new-vulnerability-in-many-wordpress
-themes/

 

The hackers uploaded a couple files that trick the server by starting with a
gif signature but then have php code in them.  Those files than open a
backdoor that allows for additional scripts to be uploaded that essentially
give shell access to the compromised machine.  In our case, the rest of the
machine was locked down enough that no harm was done.

 

Anyway, that might be something to look for.  Good luck.

Message-ID: <20120403.164424.18644.0@webmail06.dca.untd.com>

Hi!
Can you guys tell me what the PHP function that executes HTML tags when the content from the database contains HTML tags get dumped onto the webpage?
I used to know it but since I haven't used it for a long time, I can't think of its name right now.
What I am talking about is that when HTML tags got stored in the database, it gets treated like ordinary plain texts and when those plain texts get dumped onto the webpage, the browser treats or displays them as texts.
Thanks in advance!
Paul

I'm not entirely sure I understand the question.

You can echo HTML retrieved from the database to execute HTML markup.

To see the markup as text, you can echo it after running it through
htmlentities().

Double-check how the markup is being saved to the database. You might be
inadvertently applying htmlentities or other processing to escape / remove
special chars.

As Lester mentioned, it sounds like your html was escaped when it was stored to the database.  Another possibiliy is that you are using some type of framework (like Zend, Symfony, Cake, etc) that is automatically escaping output.  If you are using a framework, let us know what it is.  Just a guess, but how about this:

echo stripslashes($html);
http://php.net/stripslashes

or if that doesn't work

echo html_entity_decode($html);
http://php.net/html_entity_decode

Just be very careful about this html in your database.  If it's being entered by a user, that's a very common source of security exploits in php.  You need to make sure to clean it in some way.  HtmlPurifier is a library that can do this for you - http://htmlpurifier.org/

Thanks to Lester and Rob for replying.
I don't use any Framework or Tools--just plain PHP handwritten code.
Here's what I did:
1. Take the content from the form (<textarea> user input).
2. Escape it and add it to the database:

Content = mysql_real_escape_string($Content);
/* Add info into the database */
$query = "INSERT INTO `Content_Table`
      (
    Content`, `Datestamp`
      )
VALUES
      (
       '$Content', '$Datestamp'
      )";
mysql_query($query);
3. Retrieve the content from the database and display it on the web.
$query = @mysql_query("SELECT Content, DATE_FORMAT(Datestamp, '%W %M %d, %Y %r')
    AS FormatDatetimestamp FROM Content_Table ORDER BY Datetimestamp DESC") or mysql_error();
if (mysql_num_rows($query) > 0)
   {
     while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($query))
            {
             $Content       = $row['Content'];
             echo $Content;
           }
    }
The content that gets stored in the database contains both plain texts and HTML tags like <a>, <table>, <tr>, etc.
When those tags get displayed, the Browser doesn't treat those tags as HTML entities, but rather as ordinary plain texts.
Thanks in advance.
Paul

Hi!
Can you guys tell me what the PHP function that executes HTML tags when the content from the database contains HTML tags get dumped onto the webpage?
I used to know it but since I haven't used it for a long time, I can't think of its name right now.
What I am talking about is that when HTML tags got stored in the database, it gets treated like ordinary plain texts and when those plain texts get dumped onto the webpage, the browser treats or displays them as texts.
Thanks in advance!
Paul

I'm not entirely sure I understand the question.

You can echo HTML retrieved from the database to execute HTML markup.

To see the markup as text, you can echo it after running it through
htmlentities().

Thanks to Lester and Rob for replying.

I don't use any Framework or Tools--just plain PHP handwritten code.

Here's what I did:

1. Take the content from the form (<textarea> user input).

2. Escape it and add it to the database:


Content = mysql_real_escape_string($Content);

/* Add info into the database */
$query = "INSERT INTO `Content_Table`
      (
    Content`, `Datestamp`
      )
VALUES
      (
       '$Content', '$Datestamp'
      )";
mysql_query($query);

3. Retrieve the content from the database and display it on the web.

$query = @mysql_query("SELECT Content, DATE_FORMAT(Datestamp, '%W %M %d, %Y
%r')
    AS FormatDatetimestamp FROM Content_Table ORDER BY Datetimestamp DESC")
or mysql_error();
if (mysql_num_rows($query) > 0)
   {
     while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($query))
            {
             $Content       = $row['Content'];

             echo $Content;
           }

    }

The content that gets stored in the database contains both plain texts and
HTML tags like <a>, <table>, <tr>, etc.

When those tags get displayed, the Browser doesn't treat those tags as HTML
entities, but rather as ordinary plain texts.

Thanks in advance.

Hi!
Can you guys tell me what the PHP function that executes HTML tags when the
content from the database contains HTML tags get dumped onto the webpage?
I used to know it but since I haven't used it for a long time, I can't think
of its name right now.
What I am talking about is that when HTML tags got stored in the database,
it gets treated like ordinary plain texts and when those plain texts get
dumped onto the webpage, the browser treats or displays them as texts.
Thanks in advance!
Paul

I'm not entirely sure I understand the question.

You can echo HTML retrieved from the database to execute HTML markup.

To see the markup as text, you can echo it after running it through
htmlentities().

Double-check how the markup is being saved to the database. You might be
inadvertently applying htmlentities or other processing to escape / remove
special chars.

As Lester mentioned, it sounds like your html was escaped when it was stored
to the database.  Another possibiliy is that you are using some type of
framework (like Zend, Symfony, Cake, etc) that is automatically escaping
output.  If you are using a framework, let us know what it is.  Just a
guess, but how about this:

echo stripslashes($html);
http://php.net/stripslashes

or if that doesn't work

echo html_entity_decode($html);
http://php.net/html_entity_decode

Just be very careful about this html in your database.  If it's being
entered by a user, that's a very common source of security exploits in php.
You need to make sure to clean it in some way.  HtmlPurifier is a library
that can do this for you - http://htmlpurifier.org/

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP graphics programming for a template
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_yreKh-rpadkT-_2kW40B6ty6+6u=MK5Sh4s1xE6tCZQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've seen some articles about PHP graphics programming over the years,
but I don't have first-hand knowledge of using any of them. So I'd
like some advice on how to approach this task:

There are pre-cut cards from Blanks USA:
http://blanksusa.com/products/table-tents/digitalblanks-pre-cut-large-table-tent-5-5-x-3-125-x-5-375-table-tent-11-x-17-sheet-size-80-lb-digital-gloss-cover-100-table-tents.html

There is a graphic template JPG (300 DPI) designed by a graphic
designer. I want to be able to overlay(?) three graphics (they would
be different for each printed sheet) on this graphic template and
position them in an exact spot. Some centering would be required for
one of the graphics.

The finished graphic (graphic template plus the overlays) would need
to be positioned and aligned so when they print it matches the
requirements of the pre-cut cards.

I want to be able to take the output of this on a USB flash drive (or
DVD-ROM) to a professional printer that is using 11 x 17 color laser
printers. I want to make this as easy as possible for the printer, so
they just open the file for printing and go, without any sort of
adjustments or problems.

What PHP graphics libraries and techniques would be best for this?
Any tips for creating a high quality PDF file for the printer? Or
should this be provided in another file format?
Any tips for working with aligning with pre-cut cards? Thanks!

David Roth

I've noticed that when I've take a large file graphic image, that PDF
makes a smaller file out of the whole thing. I'm wondering if there is
a way to tell PDF not to do that to allow the printer to munch on the
higher quality image?

If you're doing large format printing you will want to use vector
graphics, not raster which will rule out jpeg or png.

Most print shops support PS, PSD and SVG. When using these formats
make sure your using vector output and not putting a raster image in
them (which they support).

Done properly it will scale up to any output size at any DPI without
any pixelization or "jaggies". That's why print shops use these
formats.

Note that vector graphic files are typically smaller than the
equivalent raster file, unless it's a very complex design.

And when your creating a PDF you can specify the resolution of
included images (which are typically embedded as a JPEG) but this
defeats the entire reason for using PSD.  You really want to use
vector PSD for printing if it's possible for your workflow.

Thanks for helping me make sense out of all this! Just to make sure I
have this right...

So to get the highest possible printing quality, return to the graphic
designer and ask for the template image generated as a vector graphic?
What file format should that be in ready for programming image overlay
manipulation? Since jpeg and png don't support vector graphics, what
file format should this be from the graphics designer? I've seen them
generate PSD (PhotoShop) files, but I'm unfamiliar with SVG if they
support that?

Once the vector graphic file is made available, the software developer
needs to output the overlay manipulation in PS (PostScript) or SVG?

With the final output file in PS or SVG, should these files contain
everything needed to align it for printing? Such as margins built into
it? What do the printers use to send the file to the printer? Rather,
what should they use?

I'm familiar with PS (PostScript) and EPS, where at least under UNIX I
could pipe them to the PostScript printer and that's all that was
needed. Is this perhaps what print shops do with PS or SVG files?
Thanks!

OK. Are their PHP library routines to support a PSD file format? Thanks!

Don't know why I typed psd, that's the photoshop file format. You want PDF.

Ghostscript is still the best open source utility for manipulating
Postscript and PDF files. The gswrapper project on sourceforge has a
php wrapper.

OK, thanks for clarifying that. I'll check out your suggestions.

What should the graphic designer provide the vector graphic image
template in for development then? They usually work I believe in
something like PhotoShop or Quark. I'm guessing, TIFF? Thanks!

Postscript, Adobe Illustrator (.ai), PDF or SVG.  Ghoscript will work 
with all of them.  TIFF supposedly supports vector but I've never 
really seen it used that way, it's only real distinction is that it's 
lossless raster which is why photographers tend to use it.

Wikipedia has a handy table of graphics file formats that you can sort 
by raster/vector.

Hey all,

I've been asked to look at PHP on IIS on WIN 2008 talking to a
SQLServer. Having been in FOSS for so long I have no idea on this. Is
it reasonably doable? Would PHP on Apache on WIn 2008 be a better
solution in terms of ease of use and setting up?

Thanks!

Lean,

It is doable and preferable to WAMP.

I suggest you get phpmanager.codeplex.com. This will let you register and
configure php with iis easily. the Isapi module is no longer supported. You
want FASTCGI  32 bit non thread safe php.

Hi!

To make it obvious: I hate IIS! I have to deal with it on a regular basis and 
it is a pain in the rear to work with. Yes, it has a flashy admin GUI, but 
that does not make it any easier. That said, the are means to get PHP to work 
with IIS. The connection to SQL Server is independent of that and works the 
same way as when running Apache. That said, a while ago I came across a 
comparison between the various stacks and it turned out that Apache on Win has 
the best performance compared to IIS on Win or Apache on Linux. That might 
have changed by now.
If it is an option, I'd go with Apache on Win. It is very stable, easy to 
configure, and it prevents all the headaches that come with IIS. OK, it leaves 
the ones that come with Apache, but you know about those. As far as scripts 
are concerned, they should work fine less the cases where you do direct file 
access, but that depends on how that part was / is going to be implemented in PHP.

Go with Apache on Win!

David

See attached for the notes I use to set this up.  Actually works quite well,
though my notes may not be 100% complete - let me know if any issues.

Han/Leam,

Good set of instructions but a two comments.

PHP 5.4.0 does not have an MSI installer and when I asked on PHP-WIN
it was indicated that there were no plans to continue it. If you add
phpmanager (http://phpmanager.codeplex.com) to IIS it will let you
register PHP as a FastCGI module easily.

You should really make an unprivileged user to run the mongod service
as.  I'm also not sure if --reinstall will work if the service is not
already installed (while I didn't write the original ntservice support
for mongo, I did improve its service support, so I'm going to have to
test it later.)

I hadn't installed 5.4 yet, though as fate would have it, needed to today.

Surprising that an MSI isn't available, but as you mention, it's still very
easy.  Here's what I did:

	For PHP 5.4.x: Download Zip for VC9 x86 Non Thread Safe
		http://windows.php.net/download/
		Uncompress into somewhere like c:\php-5.4

	Download/run installer for PHP Manager for IIS
		http://phpmanager.codeplex.com/
	IIS Manager -> PHP Manager
		Register new PHP version: Path to where PHP was installed
(c:\php-5.4)

And then carried on normally.  Still very easy, and honestly I'll probably
go with the .zip install method from now on since it's consistent across
versions.

The mongo install process on Windows is a bit messed up - I think the
--reinstall option will work, though I've had to fiddle with it before as
Mongo seems to do some silly things.  That said, I've never run mongo in
production on Windows (and probably never will) so a quick setup has
sufficed for me.

Best,

If you ever do bother to report what you find annoying about it, hit
me up offline with the ticket number and I'll see what I can do when I
got some free time.

Sounds good, thanks... the next time I do an install (likely in a couple of
weeks), I'll document more fully (and need to clean-up my docs in general :)

Firefox supporting h.264 would be huge, no question. Adobe should be
donating a LOT of money to the Mozilla Foundation right about now...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] storing last names and suffixes in a db
Message-ID: <CAAF+Sg5AuVeU=vKZq1JrgSNDD+z8tZcXb41LvctKyZoh25tSAw@mail.gmail.com>

OK, another dull andboring question for you all.

What approach to you use for storing the suffixes that people add to their
names? I'm not talking about degrees and certifications, but  things like
'Jr.' and 'Sr.' Until now the app I am revising has been using a sort of
coward's way, simply treating the whole thing as a single lastname field,
as in "Smith, Jr." If you were to search WHERE lastname = "Smith" you
should get "Smith, Jr." because that's the guy's name, isn't it.

I just did  ALTER TABLE people ADD COLUMN `suffix`
enum('Jr.','Sr.','III','IV','') DEFAULT ''  and plan to see how that goes
until I see a reason to do different.  One issue here is when you're
displaying a fullname in all its glory, you need to know whether the suffix
should be preceded by a comma. It's John Q. Public III but John Q. Public,
Jr., isn't it. The rule I think I might apply is if it has a dot as in Jr.
or Sr., it needs a comma.

Any comments?

I've also noticed that only men seem to go in for this grandiosity. What's
wrong with us guys? (Disclaimer to anyone with a suffix:   just kidding!)
