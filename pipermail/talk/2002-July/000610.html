<PRE>First of all you can download the HTML and do what ever you want with it,
but unless you have FTP access to that server you will not be able to submit
that page and even if you change the action on the form, with in all my
scripts I check where the page is coming from and if is not from my domain
is not going to be executed.  Lets just face it there are many ways of doing
things if you don't like to use JavaScript to save time and resources that's
your purgative, but I've been doing it for years and it works fine for me
and my clients, and some of my clients do well over $100,000 a month  on
there sites.

Just one more opinion.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Then, if the user has Java'sCrap turned off or not present, are they
</I>even
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; able to submit your form.  I've seen plenty of forms that won't.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Haven't had a user complain yet, and I own my own software dev company
</I>in
&gt;<i> &gt; which we have produced a number of web apps that use javascript.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps because they figure it's not worth doing business with such a
</I>&gt;<i> firm.  I certainly don't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But they all fall flat on their face when JS is off/unavailable,
</I>making
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; your site unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True, but if the client wants to get rid of the page redraw &amp; associated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delay
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during validation, then you WILL do JS and let the client know that the
</I>app
&gt;<i> &gt; will not work with JS turned off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope.  If a firm doesn't trust my professional judgement, we're not meant
</I>&gt;<i> to be doing business together.
