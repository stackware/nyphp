<PRE>Every one I've talked to that is anyone major with PHP or Zend has seemed
decent and helpful as long as I didn't ask stupid questions. They seem to
follow the rule that every other large project follows.. ask the right
person the right question. High level people get bombed with tons of
questions, suggestions, dumb ideas, good ideas, etc and tend to get tired.
Sometimes they will respond in ways that aren't really nice (and sometimes
they apologize especially if you prove not to be an idiot) but you just
have to remember that they are frequently exhausted and grumpy from
spending so much time doing what you really want them to be doing anyway.
Coding, writing docs, etc. ;) Try asking someone further down the chain.
If it needs to come to the attention of someone higher you'll typically be
directed to the right person. Works that way in almost any large project.


Don't dream it. Be it.

&gt;<i> What does this have to do with appreciating open source ? Although I will not speculate whether some person received some degrading email from a php.net webmaster (by the way I still do not see any email. for all I care there's no email), I don't see this as biting the hand that feeds you. PHP.net people are human beings just like you and me and their actions and attitudes can be discussed just like any body else's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hypothetically speaking.. had there been an email of the said type, the person receiving the email would be very much entitled to be pissed. This has nothing to do with one's appreciation of or commitment to open source software or the community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what kind of ignorence is it to suggest not using the language if you don't like the creators or contributors of PHP? If things worked that way nobody would be using qmail or even openssh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mention you know several of the PHP developers and that they wouldn't mind if somebody chooses not to use PHP over the impoliteness of a php.net webmaster. I would very much like to think otherwise. If there are no users, there is no community. Without the community there will be no PHP (or any other community dependend software or concept for that matter).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; yes, the fascist php.net people (and zend i must say) have left me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; wistful for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; generous Larry Wall (or Hans Z. :) character, or even a benevolent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dictator.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; php.net webmasters ignore 100% of my suggestions and questions which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; right, but you've got to warn your users if your bug reporting system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; connected to a Usenet, as in permanently archived, mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; when you've packed the report full of personal contact info like i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; did.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hopefully they fixed it. I did let Rasmus Lerdorf know a couple times
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I also couldn't understand how they could add commands to the language
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; w/o
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; having a better definition of what it actually did.  Surely the person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; implemented the command/function could have provided a decent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; description with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; example.  Lately the site has obviously fleshed-out, however.
