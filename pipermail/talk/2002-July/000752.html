<PRE>I was judging based on a report that was given in regarding the PHP
webmasters telling someone they should learn to read and other such
insults because someone was having trouble navigating their GUI.
I can very easily see a upper level tech deciding to try out a php
implementation of a project at say Morgan Stanley, or another big firm
and having some trouble on the website.  This person emails php.net and
gets berated... Now this person who may have converted is now just
pissed off and will probably solve his problem with another means.  Be
it that he uses PHP still, or just tells his boss that it's not worth
working with PHP because the support is so bad...

It's just not professional to have this attitude, especially if you are
an underdog.  In business, image comes way before quality... sadly
enough.  I know this point can be argued, but marketing works. Well.

I, and the DoJ, would disagree.  Apparantly, so would Netcraft :)

I haven't seen this attitude from as many people as I've heard it
speculated upon by outsiders.  I will say the average free/open 
software advocate is infinitely more pleasant than the average ISP or 
Telco rep.

It's really not fair to judge the entire group based on one alleged
overreaction.  Maybe the guy's puppy was just run over, maybe the email
he received was rude, maybe it was misinterpreted...we don't know.
However, persons are persons, and I've seen every org from Dell to
BlackBerry to Microsoft to OpenBSD have some truly obnoxious
individuals firing off unnecessarily.

So, let's judge people individually, and not by the mass stereotype.  
Unless they use M4, in which case they're just creepy and sinister.
