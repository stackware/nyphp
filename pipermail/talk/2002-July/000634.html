<PRE>A strictly JS authentication system is a BAD idea.  There are several
ways to get around it.  If you are going to use JS to authenticate data
it should only be to save the user or your servers stress.  There should
be always be server side checking as well... well unless you really
don't give a.

First of all you can download the HTML and do what ever you want with
it,
but unless you have FTP access to that server you will not be able to
submit
that page and even if you change the action on the form, with in all my
scripts I check where the page is coming from and if is not from my
domain
is not going to be executed.  Lets just face it there are many ways of
doing
things if you don't like to use JavaScript to save time and resources
that's
your purgative, but I've been doing it for years and it works fine for
me
and my clients, and some of my clients do well over $100,000 a month  on
there sites.

Just one more opinion.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But they all fall flat on their face when JS is off/unavailable,
</I>making
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; your site unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True, but if the client wants to get rid of the page redraw &amp;
</I>associated
&gt;<i> &gt; delay
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during validation, then you WILL do JS and let the client know that
</I>the
app
&gt;<i> &gt; will not work with JS turned off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope.  If a firm doesn't trust my professional judgement, we're not
