<PRE>Yes I see your point.  

However, the original communication from PHP made someone feel slighted.
Regardless of the content of the message from PHP, it made that person
feel bad for having contacted asking for assistance because his question
or comment was unwelcome to the recipient (php.net).  It's just not
professional, nor does it help the open source cause to shut people out
like this.  That's all.  Think before you hit send.  If your stressed,
go take a walk and remember what the outdoors looks like perhaps.  I
don't know, but don't take it out on potential clients.  That's just bad
business.

I did not rumor that anyone who emails php will get this type of
response.  But someone did get a response like this, and one time is
more than enough.  Chances are that was not the only degrading email
that left their mail servers.  (I'm assuming the message was degrading
as I trust the people on this list, and unless he has a personal
vendetta against php, he was made to feel shitty from a reply from
php.net... no reason to make this stuff up.)

I'm not saying PHP.NET is evil, just that this attitude is.  Go read a
bunch of OS based responses on /. And you will cringe and be embarrassed
to admit you run linux.  Almost good reason to switch to BSD! Lol.

The email you sent me off-list, where you called me &quot;an evil moron who
can't read&quot; deeply hurt my feelings.  Everyone, take this as an official
report that Adam's employer is not someone with whom you should do
business.

Of course, I'm being facetious, but the point is made.  Someone says
&quot;they were rude&quot; and the rumors begin.  Assuming the report is even
true, maybe the guilty party at PHP was repremanded for it.  PHP has 
done a lot for us, we can at least give them some benefit of the doubt.


&gt;<i> I can very easily see a upper level tech deciding to try out a php

</I>
This is a totally unfair assumption.  You're rumouring anyone who 
emails php.net gets insulted, once again with no proof or evidence.  My
point in the original email was simply to be fair and not make
judgements about how an entire organization behaves based on one
speculatory email.

Your response is to speculate that if upper management at Morgan Stanley
has problems, PHP.net will automatically flip them the bird.

That's not fair.  As Oktay (I think) said, if we can all see the email 
exchange, we'll decide for ourselves.  Until then, it's borderline 
slanderous to continue like this, and without merit.


In closing: If you are fair, judge based on facts and don't 
  perpetuate stereotypes and rumors, we'll all be happier.
  I'm not denying they could definitely be completely rude, but
  we don't have any reason to think they usually are.
