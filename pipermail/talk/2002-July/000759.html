<PRE>What does this have to do with appreciating open source ? Although I will not speculate whether some person received some degrading email from a php.net webmaster (by the way I still do not see any email. for all I care there's no email), I don't see this as biting the hand that feeds you. PHP.net people are human beings just like you and me and their actions and attitudes can be discussed just like any body else's.

Hypothetically speaking.. had there been an email of the said type, the person receiving the email would be very much entitled to be pissed. This has nothing to do with one's appreciation of or commitment to open source software or the community. 
 
And what kind of ignorence is it to suggest not using the language if you don't like the creators or contributors of PHP? If things worked that way nobody would be using qmail or even openssh. 

You mention you know several of the PHP developers and that they wouldn't mind if somebody chooses not to use PHP over the impoliteness of a php.net webmaster. I would very much like to think otherwise. If there are no users, there is no community. Without the community there will be no PHP (or any other community dependend software or concept for that matter).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right, but you've got to warn your users if your bug reporting system
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connected to a Usenet, as in permanently archived, mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> That's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bad 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when you've packed the report full of personal contact info like i
</I>&gt;<i> did. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hopefully they fixed it. I did let Rasmus Lerdorf know a couple times
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also couldn't understand how they could add commands to the language
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; w/o 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having a better definition of what it actually did.  Surely the person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented the command/function could have provided a decent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; description with
