<PRE>Can we all stop crying for a few moments to recognize how much time the
people that work on the site and documentation take out of their lives
for no money?  If you have a problem with it then join the team and help
them, otherwise stop bitching.  As for the bug system... the open-srm
crew was working on Bubar, a new bug system, for php.net.  I worked on
it a bit with them, but time constraints didn't allow much of my time.
Last I heard Derrick and Jani had put the application on hold, until
time there was more time available.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] PHP.NET webmasters

yes, the fascist php.net people (and zend i must say) have left me
wistful for a 
generous Larry Wall (or Hans Z. :) character, or even a benevolent
dictator.

php.net webmasters ignore 100% of my suggestions and questions which is
their 
right, but you've got to warn your users if your bug reporting system is

connected to a Usenet, as in permanently archived, mailing list.  That's
bad 
when you've packed the report full of personal contact info like i did. 
Hopefully they fixed it. I did let Rasmus Lerdorf know a couple times
about it.

I also couldn't understand how they could add commands to the language
w/o 
having a better definition of what it actually did.  Surely the person
who 
implemented the command/function could have provided a decent
description with 
example.  Lately the site has obviously fleshed-out, however.
