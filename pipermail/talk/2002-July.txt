Hi,

I'm trying to sift through the numerous offerings for an open source or
third party web calendar system. I'm looking to you for recommendation if
you have experience with a good one.


Thanks!

A program that I found quite interesting is phpprojekt although that one
goes quite a bit beyond being just a calendar.  It allows you to view other
people's schedules also to make meetings easier to plan, etc.

Jim

I work for a technical recruiting company in NYC, if you would like to send
me your resume I could pass it on to the recruiters and see if they could
come up with something. We deal mostly with the big financial companies. We
currently have 197 jobs, but you wouldn't be qualified for all of them of
course. Unless you know MUMPS? :)

Ok, I got a good question for you anyone that can
answer:

I'd like to setup linux on my new laptop but I
haven't used linux seriously since the days of
slackware from about 4 years ago. Which linux
distribution would be best for a Dell Inspiron in
the sense of good drivers and power management.
Also, would anyone be willing to volunteer some
time perhaps at the next meeting or before the
next meeting to give me a hand?
Right now I'm using windows xp home (bleh) so I'd
like to use dual boot since my games won't run in
linux.

Well i've set up a dual boot sony vaio super slim with
windows xp pro and redhat 7.2 The red hat distro
reconizes practicly everything automaticly super easy
to use with a laptop if you don't want to spend a few
days finding drivers to feed the laptop. i used
partition magic to shrink my win xp partition to half
the drive then during the install let linux use the
unused space the only driver i needed to do myself was
firewire but maybe they have that in 7.3, or maybe you
don't need it. the distro is easy to download from
redhat's site as ISO's so you just burn them and
install,and there is ton's of doc's if you need them.
so good luck.

Evan,

Almost any distribution will work on an Inspiron, they tend to be easy to
work with. I would suggest Debian. The install is tricky, but once it's
installed, it's easier to work with.

I wish I could help you do the install, but I'm in FL.

Hi,

My Brother has an Inspiron, and has been running RH 7.3 for a bit with no
hang ups.
Hes not very skilled with Linux, so I was surprised to find out that it
installed
without a hitch. ( no funky drivers etc... ).  Everything works on his unit.

If you go with Mandrake 8.2 on an Inspiron (mine is inspiron 8100 with the nvidia chip) everything will be probed and configured properly except for the modem (for which I am told there's a lucent driver) and XFree. You need nvidia's own kernel module and driver from their site. It is pretty easy to install and use a readily available XFree configuration file to get the display going at full resolution. linux-laptops.net has around 10 pages that relate to installing on the inspiron 8100 (other models too but they are all similar).

All in all inspiron is a perfect linux laptop and if you're a newbie, you can't go wrong with Mandrake.

The drivers and PM are a part of the kernel, so all GNU/Linux
distributions are exactly the same in that sense.  They differ mainly
in the philosophy of how things are done, types of software installed as
part of the base distro and to which crowd they'd like to cater.  
Red Hat seems to be the favorite for desktop users, though Debian 
lends itself more to the freedom in Free Software, and easier updating.  
It's all about preference.

linux-laptop.net should give some idea of what will or might-not work.
Take it with a grain of salt, I've gotten some laptops 
unlisted/listed-as-flawed  running beautifully.

I think I'm going to be at the next meeting...if I am, I'll get it

Message-ID: <20020706200956.17854.qmail@web12805.mail.yahoo.com>


Hello folks,

I hope everyone is having a good [long] weekend.

I reported a bug some time ago about .phps files crashing PHP with
output buffer enabled.  The bug details are available at
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15943.

As is evident from the notes, Derick wants the latest snapshot tested. 
Does anyone have this (or a fairly recent) snapshot installed?  If so,
with output_buffering set to 4096, do .phps files dump PHP?  I'm not
sure what platform/module/cgi configurations would make a difference,
but if anyone happens to have a CVS snapshot installed, this would be a
great help.

Thanks,

HZ

Message-ID: <FF3F07F9-9151-11D6-A5B0-003065481BD8@mac.com>

Hello everyone!  This is regarding HTML forms, PHP & MySQL.

I'm just learning PHP & MySQL.  I do know HTML though (big deal lol).

My Question:

How do you create an html form that goes to a preview screen and then 
allows the user to move back to the form if they made any errors and 
corrections are needed or click the send button to submit the form?  The 
form's contents are then inserted into a database table.

The actions I want the user to take are as follows:
1) Fill out form.
2) Press Preview Button (the only button on that page).
3) Look over preview of text entered. (this should be on a new page and 
appear as text, not text in form fields.)
4a) If user finds mistake in text of Preview, click Edit button (or link 
or Browser back button) to go back to form and make changes. Then user 
repeats steps 1 (editing not re-entering data) through 4.
4b) If user does not find mistakes in text of Preview, clicks submit 
button that INSERTS form data into MySQL table.
5) User gets a new page thats says "thank you. form submitted."

I already know how to INSERT form data into a table and ECHO the data 
onto a page after the data was inserted, but I can't figure out how to 
add the Preview in the middle before inserting the data.


Many thanks to anyone who can help me with this!

Just incase you need to know.. my current setup is:

Message-ID: <F150ZTt07TrOdlXPec800006e70@hotmail.com>

Hi steve..

Just found your problem..

let's just quickely sort out solution..u have 3 options..

1=> you can use hidden vars which will contain..those form field data which 
user fills in ..and action of your form would be that preview page..so that 
u can get..all those vars in preview form..

u can print those vars in text forms in preview page..and again..if user 
wants to edit those data then action of that preview page could be that 
filling in form so again u will pass those hidden data in editing mode...

Now if in preview form user wants to submit..form then u can chnage action 
of from by javascipt...when user clicks submit button...i.e. that page which 
will insert data into tables..

This is hiden var method..but not useful when there r lots of field..

2=>
Instead..u can use..temporarly table in mysql which can hold those 
data...and when final submission is made by user then it will be deleted 
from database..

3=>
also u can create a temp file..which can store all form filed vars in in 
text fromat .and can be used..to add edit data..

and when final submission is made then that temp file can be deleted 
safely..

hope this can help you

Thanks
Anirudh... Z.

Hello,

I would really like to go with option 1 that Anirudhsinh suggested.
I tried using hidded fields to a preview.php page but I get a Parse 
error on line 30.
Here are lines 28 through 33:

<form method="POST" action="submit.php"" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<?php
echo?"<input type=hidden name=\\"Full_Name\\" value=\\"$Full_Name\\">";
echo?"<input type=hidden name=\\"Email\\" value=\\"$Email\\">";
echo?"<input type=hidden name=\\"Message\\" value=\\"$Message\\">";
?>

Does anyone have any idea what could be causing the error?

Thank Goodness for this list!!!!!!

If it wasn't for me pasting my code into my last email reply to this 
list, I never would have noticed those strange cross "?" looking 
characters in my code next to each echo.  They are invisible to the eye 
when I see my code through my editor (BBEdit for OS X).  But since I saw 
them in the email copy of my code, I turned on the "Show Invisibles" 
feature in BBEdit and there they were!  Only in BBEdit they looked like 
grey colored bullets.  So I got rid if them and then my code worked!!!!  
A whole day waisted because if them darn invisible characters.  I 
figured out how they got there.  From copying and pasting code from a 
forum webpage straight into my text editor.  That's what I get for 
trying to save myself from a little extra typing. LoL

Well, I hope no one ever has to ever go through that ordeal.

Thanks for listening.
- Steve ;-)

Message-ID: <F57GpkeH9urkcpA9FlG00005465@hotmail.com>

Well steve

I suggest that u don't use..embedded HTML-pHp file system..
it will cause lot of problem..

insetad u use classes..download "rFastemplate.php" from php.net..and use 
seperate html and php files...so that u will not get this kind of parse 
errors..

in your file..it doesn't seem that you have error in codes..but check 
whether is there any invisible charcters or not..which u may not be able to 
see but..may cause error..

Also check first line...<form method="POST" action="submit.php"" 
enctype="multipart/form-data"> where u placed 2 "" after word submit.php 
which is also wrong remove extra one.

Thanks

Airudh Zala

hmmm, a bit confused. You want to pull out a url from a variable, then 
display it to the screen?  I would just use a regex on that, find your 
relevant link, then just spit it to the screen.

Hey dude:

The following code looks for stuff in the format of:

www.----

and replaces it with 

<a href = 'http://www.----'>www.-----</a>

You can tweak it for your purposes.

Good luck,

Hise

<?php
$test_text = ereg_replace("www.[^<>[:space:]]+[[:alnum:]/]", "<a href =

WEll, Jeremy, though your code is good, but I think
mine is much better. since it can as well look for
stuff like : http://, and not XXwww.abc.com

here u are :

function scanText($text) { // this function is to scan
out any URL link and return it with the ahref link

         $before = $text;
         //print "before = $before<br>";
         $search = array ("/(\\bhttp*:\\/\\/(\\S+)\\b)/ie",
"/((\\s+)www(\\S+)\\b)/ie");
         $replace = array("' <a href=\\"\\\\1\\"
target=\\"_blank\\"
class=\\"indexMenu\\">'.trim('\\\\1').'</a> '", "' <a
href=\\"http://'.substr(trim('\\\\1'), 0,
strlen(trim('\\\\1'))).'\\" target=\\"_blank\\"
class=\\"indexMenu\\">http://'.substr(trim('\\\\1'), 0,
strlen(trim('\\\\1'))).'</a> '");
         $result = preg_replace ($search, $replace,
$before);

         return "$result ";

}

just pass your variables through this function and get
the link return.

Hello,
  I am running Red Hat 7.3 on my Toshiba laptop which came 
with Win XP pre-installed (bleh--rather have w2k).I 
understand that the new Mandrake distro (8?) will also do 
fine with minimal config problems--just do a search on 
their web sites or google. I found my info at:
http://www.xdiv.com/laptop/toshiba-linux.html
( if I remember correctly, they had a rather large list of 
laptops there.....)good luck, joe marabotto
ps--I like slackware also, but needed a quick fix on this 
one..)

I had sent this out this morning, but sent it to nyphp.com.  When I
didn't see it come out on the list, I got nervous and sent a test
message.  Sorry folks.

Subject: Cycling through posted variables
Message-ID: <B952FAE1.B36C%brent@landover.com>

I'm trying to cycle through the "fields" posted through a form submit. I
need to cycle through the "fields" because I won't know the names of the
fields since the field name actually represents a value. I tried going
through the $HTTP_POST_VARS route and $_POST. Since this is suppose to be an
array, I thought I could cycle through using something like $_POST[0][1],
but this doesn't seem to work.
For testing, if I do $_POST["Game1"], then it works. Any ideas what I'm
doing wrong or a better approach?

Why do I need to do something like this? Well, I'm designing a system to
handle a football pool I manage every year. This piece is for submitting a
users picks for the week. I want the field name to be the Game ID and the
value would be the Team ID. The picks screen uses radio buttons and the user
picks the winner for each game. All games for the week (~12) are displayed
at once for convenience.

I'm using PHP 4.1.2 (on OSX), but can upgrade if need be. I probably should
anyway.

Thanks

Try this:

while (list($k,$v) = each($_POST)) {
	echo "$k: $v<br>";
}

In your example, $k will be "Game1" and $v will be $_POST["Game1"]

Good Luck,

Hi.

This seems nice example..

but before using this function..first do check that that var is an array.
i.e. if u know that sometimes this vars will not have any key-value
sometimes.. then...before using foreach..check whether this is array ot
not..else it will giv error of "invalid arguments in for each loop" or
similar...

Thanks

Howdy,
This is quick-and-dirty code that I've used:

/*********************************************************/
foreach( $_POST as $k => $v ) {
	if( is_array($v) ) {
		echo '<hr>'.$k.' [Array]:<br>';
		foreach($v as $t1 => $t2 ) {
			echo sprintf("%40s : %s\
",'['.$t1.']',$t2);
		}
	} else {
		echo sprintf("%20s : %s\
",$k,$v);
	}
}
/*********************************************************/

It would be better & more elegant if it called a funtion that would recurse,
spitting out arrays of arrays of arrays .... etc.

Something like:

function printVals( thing )
	global indent

	if thing is scalar {
		print indent thing
		return
	} else if thing is array {
		print "ARRAY"
		indent++
		foreach( thing as subthing )
			printVals( subthing )
		indent--
	}

	return
}

Hi all..

A am Anirudh Zala..just joined, your NYpHp group.

A am working in a software export company in INDIA called Globalwebwise..We
provide ..various type of web based solutions using LAMP+  tech..

AMP all u know..so "L" stands for Linux and "+" means we also use XML and
Perl to enhance power of this tech.. We r in this field since last 2
years..and we export softwares across Europe..specially Finland and UK..and
other countries..

I know all of you are familiar with above tech.. I have found that this
group is working nice and there r lots of developers and beginners have
joined this group..

This tech..is growing at fastest rate..and been very popular among
developers...though this tech... is new but very efficient and porvides
flexible solutions to..all customers..according to their requirement.

But latest developing in LAMP is WAP pHp which going to be popular soon..

Also best luck to all...developer..If u have any query or problems do ask
me..i will surely answer or help if possible..

Well ending up here..do remember 1 thing that in this field "Only those who
see the invisible can do the impossible"

Thanks,

Your sincerely,
Anirudh Zala

Thanks, I know that works. I should have been clearer. I actually only want
to cycle through some of the fields, not all. For instance, other fields
that are posted are the player ID, Week ID, and number of Games.

So I really want to just grab a subset of all the posted fields, the subset
being the first (or last) x fields, x being the number of games. I know I
could use the loop below with an incrementing variable and an exit, but I
just feel that I'm missing something more elegant.

Are you generating those variable names on the fly while drawing the form ?

You might be able to get the variables in an array.. Try the following..

let's say you're working on game 13 and 45.. name your radio buttons (each set of them I per game) as

name=game[13]
...
...
name=game[45]


WHen this is submitted, you can just traverse the 'game' array which will have game id as the index and the value being the user's pick for that particular game. Obviously you can automate the creation of the form by using a variable as the index.. (name=game[$current_id])

Good luck.

Thanks. Actually I was just about to go on that train of thought based on
some reading I was doing. The variable names are generated on the fly. I
think your suggestion may work.

...and I just tried it and it does.  Thanks!

Does anyone have experience with 802.11a wireless products with Linux, as to
which brands are most compatible and offer best performance?  Is the Linksys
WAP54A access point and the corresponding PCMCIA card a good choice?

thanks,
Jim

According to the MSDN IE DOM reference:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/properties/bor
dercolor_1.asp

The attribute is BORDERCOLOR.

<TABLE BORDERCOLOR = sColor... >

General URL for this reference:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml

Incidentally, a good trick for a colored border is to use a cellspacing
> 0 and a tablewide bgcolor. Then set the rows to white (or whatever.)

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 bgcolor=#0000ff>
<tr bgcolor=#ffffff>
    ...
</tr>
</table>

I use this effect a lot in my apps.

About two years ago I did.  I've worked mostly with Lucent and D-Link
cards.  Lucent (at that time anyway) was the best - D-Link worked, was
a little fineky, but you couldn't beat the price.

Can't tell you from direct expierence, but I've always liked Linksys. 
However, I think I would stay away from Cisco (if they even have a card
for Linux).

http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/ (writes the
drivers)

By the way, thanks for the HTML help - working well!

Only used Mac airport and there base on YDL.  Works fine set up probably 
similar since I think all the hardware is basically the same Lucent 
cards if I remember correctly.

Oktay,

  You are correct, I was asking about .11a but I think most answers were
about .11b.  The .11a is the faster 54Mbps protocol that works in the 5Ghz
range.

Jim

Hans,

Just one more comment on the colored table question.

Here is a sample of some nice effects for calendars I got from the 1px 
cellspacing and bg color idea that was mentioned.  Feel free to gank the

Message-ID: <1026416825.3205.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi:

I've got a PHP script that seems to be executing twice.

The page basically does the following:

1) Accept FORM vars from posting page
2) Checks to see if a any records already contain the value posted
3) If not, send that value to a stored procedure that inserts it
4) If so, alert the user and bail

However, when I call this page, I get the results from #4. Even though
the value doesn't exist in the database. If I exit after #2 and before #
3, it tells me that #3 should fire. But #4 does...which would indicate
that the code is executing twice...which just seems ridiculous to me.

As a side note, the machine that is running this has a history of odd
behavior including:

1) PHP randomly stops rendering HTML
2) Random/garbage Oracle output

If any of you have any ideas about the weird double execution, please
let me know.

Thanks,

Jeremy

There's a word I haven't seen since middle school. Gank. It is a very
good word in that context though. LOL

About the double execution. I've done this several times in the past. If
after #3 executes and you want it to stop you must specify "exit;" in
order to stop further execution. Without seeing the code you are using
it can't be determined whether you are using it or not. If you are
sorry, if not give it a try.

Actually, I have my 3 and 4 reversed. I know it's not that. I was just
wondering if any of you have seen such sporadic behavior.

Thanks,

Appending the following url parameter to any .php file processed by php 4.01
and later gives you a ns little easter egg..
very attractive i must say!

Check that you're breaking out of nested loops properly and have
explicit elses/breaks where needed extra - watch for the
waterfall/fall-through effect.

Versions/platform?  I've seen wierd behavior with OCI, mostly with
persistent connections, so that might be something to play around with.
 Also I've seen PHP get confused with recursive includes/requires
(mostly on 4.0.6).

No, wankers, "gank" is "yank" spanked tanked.

Now riddle me something a little more tricky: if PHP has surpassed ASP 
(http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/06/11/011243.shtml) and mod_perl 
(http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.200206/apachemods.html) in 
usage, how come Perl and VB jobs dwarf PHP's (http://mshiltonj.com/sm/) and i've 
nothing better to do than post rhymes and riddles? :)

If for some reason bordercolor doesn't work in a specific browser I might
suggest adding another table behind it with a background color and create a
cellpadding.

<table bgcolor="#000000" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
 <tr>
  <td>
    YOUR TABLE
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

NEW YORK -- This weekend, a few thousand systems-obsessed individuals 
will be able to fuel their paranoia in workshops that promise to reveal 
in hellish detail the wicked machinations of governments and big 
corporations.

They will also scoff at the misguided attempts of the "amateur" security 
workers who are charged with keeping them out of computer systems. They 
will openly share information on how to subvert those computer systems. 
They will privately worry whether their obsessive need to dissect data 
could lead to jail time.

On the same subject, I used to teach network, security, and basic
programming classes to youths in the Bronx.  I have over two dozens of 486
CPUs (IBM and Compaq) not in use at the moment.  They are great for Linux.
If you are interested, please give me a buzz.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44L-027.0207151054220.2246-100000@unix6.andrew.cmu.edu>

my currently working on a c++ program that takes a large set of position
data (300,000 floats) and calculates using a statistical criteria selects
a certain set.

my program works fine when i filter out some data before my final
selection (eg: selecting a certain date range in the query), but when i
select the whole table (which i have to do often)
mysql_store_result(mysql); seems not to able to give me everything i want
since the first entry in the first row is null. i can access some data
after that but its a little strange, possibly its not all there. Can
anyone suggest a good way to get all the data?

i'm using the LIMIT word in mysql to break it into parts, i need to make
it fast and to select the whole table right now, takes a few seconds (4
or so, keep in mind its still doesn't give me everything right) so i don't
want to make to many queries, since the result get feed back to a webpage

I've been made aware of a new site, http://php.meetup.com.  The
meetings are all over the world, and there are some right here in NY
and the surrounding areas.

Unfortunately I will be out of town when the meeting takes place (8/1)
but I hope many of you will be able to attend, as it looks like it'll
be a lot of fun.

There are also many other meeting topics, with Slashdot looking to be
the most popular so far.  Take a look at http://meetup.com for all the
other topics and cities.

That's a nifty idea.  I'm NJ and the nearest Meetup is in the Edison
area, about an hour from me...I'd love a Somerset County area Meetup.

Take a look at http://www.mysql.com/doc/C/_/C_API_problems.html,
specifically the first one.  You could be running out of memory, but
use some of the diag functions (like mysql_field_count(),
mysql_error(), etc) and some system utils. to see if your result set is
what you're expecting and weather you're running out of memory.  I
suppose there could be a bug in the API, but doubtful, especially if
you're using a modern version.  Also use the mysql client and run the
same query - does that work?

For testing purposes, uses a LIMIT, increasing it everytime... where
does it start to fail?

Webpage?  Shouldn't you be doing this in PHP?  :)  Regardless, if you
have a large number of records, you really should do some kind of
caching.  MySQL's heap tables can be great for this.

I was going to say they are still experimental, but I just looked at

If possible, I'd like to see some of your code, once completed, as this

Hello All,

I am running PHP 4.2.1 on Mac OS X.

When I look at at the results of <?php phpinfo() ?> it does say the

not see the file.

Any help from someone else using Mac OS X?

Thanks,

Well, I do not have any code yet, but I can explain what I'm trying to do.
I want to load the most accessed (read from) db tables as arrays into a
shared memory segment at startup. Has anyone done or heard of anything like
that done? I'm not talking about heap tables but using php's shared memory
functions (shm_*) instead.  I realize that querying those arrays will not
be as easy as quering a sql database but i'll come up with some kind of
interface function(s).  I should probably mention I'm talking about a
*very*  busy site with thousands of select queries/sec. Also, I heard that
it's a good idea to rebuild the shm segment often (cron job) due to memory
leaks in PHP when using shm_* functions. Was that ever fixed?  Is there
anything I should consider before starting to implement this approach.

Hi!

I've been asking a number of people this question but haven't received a
satisfactory answer, so was wondering if anyone here can help.

Both a database (such as MySQL) and XML can be used for storing,
manipulating (XML w/ XSLT), rendering data.

How does one decide between the two?

One scenario I might be dealing with soon is taking product information
from a DOS system and throwing it out to either MySQL or XML for posting on
a web site.

Thanks.

A database is designed for optimum storage and fast retrieval of data.  XML deals more with the representation of existing data. I believe you have to use the right tool for the job. Obviously you can still use XML with the data you have gathered from a database.

How would you store the XML? Flat files? In that case I think you're
going to find that approach a little slow. Relational databases have a
lot of advantages.

There's nothing mutually exclusive about using a database AND XML. You
ideally could store your data in a properly normalized database, write
object-oriented PHP to query it, generate well-formed XML from the query
results, and fold in XSLT to emit HTML.

There are even databases out there that claim to store data natively in
XML (some of which support query languages with better grammar than
SQL). Searching for "Open-source XML database" on Google:

Hey folks,

Trying to find the php.ini file on my system.

I am running Mac OS X and PHP 4.2.1

Someone else installed and set up PHP on this machine, but I do have 
admin access.

The PHP info function shows me that it is located in /usr/local/lib but 
when I open a terminal and go to that directory the file is not there.

Anyone else using Mac OSX who could help me?

I'm pretty sure MacOS X has the 'find' command. Maybe even 'locate'.

Try 'locate php.ini' first. If that doesn't work try the following as root. 

find / | grep php.ini    

(there's a regexp issue there that you can ignore--for simplicity)

On another note, not seeing the file where phpinfo.php claims it is might mean that you don't have a copy on your system. Try dropping the file there yourself (it doesn't need to be complete.. a one line option will do fine) set an option and test if it makes a difference after restarting your web server.

You can try several things.  
1. grep for php.ini
2. cp another php.ini to the /usr/local/lib (if you have write access) -
something people forget for copy the file there during installation (manual)
3. get into single mode if you have full possession on the box - this will
give you root access

0. Don't try to re-invent the wheel. You're not the first person to deal
with such problems and I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find something
that already exsists to solve your problem.

1. I don't know enough about your requirements, but a full page caching
solution might do the trick. I use jpcache on my site with great results.
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpcache/)

2. PEAR has a DB caching package you might want to look into.
http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=40

4. You might want to look into MySQL 4. Even tough it's still "devel",
it seems to be quite stable. It has built in RESULT caching ;) This allows
it to be EXTREMELY fast for your common querries. 

Feel free to contact me directly if you want.

Thanks Larry and Oktay!

I did not occur to me that the file might not exist. I created one 
containing the one variable I wanted to change and dropped it in that 
directory, restarted Apache, and bingo, it worked!

Thanks so much!

Thanks for the responses.

But if I'm storing data in a database then why not skip xml and output the
data to a text file and save as html where I'm outputting the recordset one
by one using something like:

x = "<p>" + productID + "</br>"

where productId is the record from the recordset I'm looping through and
any transformation is done in the sql statement used to open the recordset?

Sure.. You can either display the data dynamically on the fly..(this is pretty much what everybody else is doing) Or save it as html to display later. I said you could *still* use XML because you mentioned it.

The advantage of using XML between the database and the presentation ( HTML
etc. ) is that you have your data from your query in an organized fashion
that can be used and manipulated beyond just the web page.  For example, I
don't bother buying a TV guide anymore, I just check www.tvguide.com and get
my local listings.  I really want to get my local listings on my Palm, but I
don't like the options available.  So I being a programmer decided to rip
what's on the tvguide site, format it the way I want then put it on my Palm.
Well, their site is a complex combo of HTML and javascript.  Parsing will be
complicated.  And then, what if they change the page slightly which breaks
my parser?

Here XML comes to the rescue.  If they delivered the data portion of the
page as XML, I can forget about parsing the HTML looking for what I want, I
can go directly to the XML & parse it.  And if they change the XML, I have a
good chance my parser will still work so long as the fields I am looking for
are still there.

There are also those who claim that use of XML and XSLT lead to more
consistent pages with better organized code and quicker development time.  I
being a long time HTML coder feel comfortable enough with what I can do in
HTML that I don't care to learn the XSLT.  I can code quickly enough,
consistent enough, and organized enough for me!

That's the central trade-off of using abstraction.

On one hand it's usually simpler and faster (in both development time
and execution) to use domain-specific solutions like the one below.
Quick and dirty, gets the job done.

On the other hand, abstraction brings flexibility and generality.
Decoupling of data from presentation has been a holy grail for web
programming for many years. You could completely change the appearance
of your site, or present your data in a different context, by editing
only your stylesheets. This is typically more of a long-term
requirement.

The one irreducible truth under any scenario is that you should design
your data schema with care.

I think it breaks down to using a DB for large data that might be static 
and not have to reside im memory all the time vs. quick XML/XPath in 
memory configuration for ur application ... @ least this is the way I 
see it in my applications (mostly AI based) ...

The one big drawback is not having the ability to make use of both very 
easily for example XML<->DB where changes in the XML reflect the changes 
to the DB, it is quite possibly to do but not practicle with large rows 
of data, however you can write small tidbits of XML that might reflect a 
single row or something ... it should also be noted that the notion of 
XML is the point of readibility for humans anyway ;-)

XML as I see it is best for configuration files (filename based), maybe 
object modeling, and p2p, but for large amounts of data (unless you even 
out ur tables to small column counts), you will save a headache by just 
using a DB.

Hi Bruce..

what's xml file ? a kind of db to store data..

but as other said.it's slow to access data..bcoz it's not well 
formatted...query will take longer time than retrieving data from db..bcoz 
db is well normalized and data is stored in proper way..

also u can't store well fornmatted data..into xslt or xml...
ya u can use them to store..less data compare to db..specially or common or 
global data for which frequent access is needed.in those cases xml is useful 
bcoz we don't need to access db frequently..

but this tech is new..and doesn't work as fast as db..

however we also use xml files to store data...which r used repetetively..but 
not for storing larger data..

Sometimes xml r very useful for transferring data..perhaps this is the 
excellent use of xml

when u need to transfer data from one db to other db or server then xml can 
be very useful as it can also store..data with field values so while storing 
data into other db, we can easily select db fields...from xml and store data 
in exact manner as it was in previous db..

Thanks

if nothing works then find out whether php has been installed as an apache 
module or not..if so then u can't find php.ini as it is not needed for that 
installation..

Well on my site we use XML and a database.

When I first launched my site, I did everything in PHP and noticed that in
peak times my site would slow down considerably. I realized that my content
didn't have to be dynamic; meaning, it doesn't really need to change
everytime the user hits refresh.  So I set up my site to run through all of
my articles in the database and create HTML files for them. Later, I
switched to XML so that outside site could pull the files and use it on
thier site.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Database vs. XML


Hi!

I've been asking a number of people this question but haven't received a
satisfactory answer, so was wondering if anyone here can help.

Both a database (such as MySQL) and XML can be used for storing,
manipulating (XML w/ XSLT), rendering data.

How does one decide between the two?

One scenario I might be dealing with soon is taking product information
from a DOS system and throwing it out to either MySQL or XML for posting on
a web site.

Thanks.

Hello,
I'm trying to figure out a way to utilize the power of PHP on my Win NT
box at work because I can't afford the time to install Linux right now.
Has anyone tried to run Windows PHP binaries? If so, is it necessary to
install IIS? I'd like to serve webpages over the corporate network via IIS
using some PHP logic. Anyone try such a thing? Thanks for helping out!

http://www.badblue.com -- simple web server, no need to go with Apache or
IIS right now and allows you to test PHP and Perl on your local machine.
Also helps to install MySQL and go the whole 9 yards.

Clay,

How about trying Apache/PHP/MySQL for windows. 

I have a older version of PHP-triad which installed Apache, PHP, MySQL on my windows machines. I currently use it on a Win 2000 Advanced Server for my website but am working on getting newer versions up due to the Apache security hole. There is a FAQ on how to do it at: http://www.adslworld.net/. You need to be a member (free) but the FAQ (in the forum section) should walk you through installation. I am testing it out now so I can't guarantee the FAQ.
I haven't run in to any problems with the win binaries.

Hope this helps

Jessica 
PS: Make sure that you get the version of PHP that the FAQ wants. 4.2.1 wont work on Apache 2.0.39 you need 4.2.2

Your best bet is probable apache + PHP binaries for windows.
It took be about 2 hours to get Apache + PHP + MySQL setup and running
on my win2k box (including download time ;)

I was just gonna recommend that too, but it seems like it's not supported anymore and the developer is trying to 'make it worth his while' or he won't release version 3.0. He wants something like $25,000 in donations or he wants to charge for the software.

Hi all,
I have a quick question: I'm using PHP v 4.2.1 on a Win2K Server Box Build
2195
My problem is that, when I set cookie lifetime to zero (for session
handling), everything works as it should (session does not expire unless
browser window is closed) but when I put a value other than 0 (60 for
example), it seems that php always starts a new session at each call of
session_start() no matter what the life of the cookie is. Any suggestions?

We have our production and testing  servers running on Linux  but I do all
my developments locally on my W2K professional. It took me maybe one hour to
get it to run. I shut down IIS on my machine and I'm running only Apache.
Key issues to make it run faster:
After installing Apache and PHP edit the follwing files:

Edit php.ini and put it in c:\\winnt (or whatever your system root is)
Edit httpd.conf in the conf folder of apache

If you feel that this is a lot of hassle then just install badblue that has
web server and php running already.

Subject: DB <-> XML <-> DB/TLL/BLL/IL(GUI/CUA)
Message-ID: <244640-22002731712032781@softwareprototypes.com>

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a way of tagging a stream of data.

DTDs (Document Tag Definitions, usually in a seperate document,) are
required to that system A and system B can agree on the semiotics
(the semantics and c0ontextual dependencies,) of the tags and thus
exchange information.

XML is a format for expressing data contained in a file or data base.
It is NOT a database.

As for rendering, use XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language
Transformation) because that what it does. Expresses XML streams into
something renderable by transforming these into HTML.

There si no decision to be made. They are used in entirely seperate
areas.

A database (MySQL, PostGreSQL, DB2, Oracle, etc,) stores data (with
varying success and apply varying degrees of validation and
relational integrity checking.) It can also receive data and transmit
data as an XML stream. (You don't want to deal with a database engine
that doesn't.)

XML is a human readable means of transmitting the data to/from a
database engine, a busines logic layer, a transation procesing layer
or a interaction layer (GUI or merely CUA compliant inter-system
interface.) 

Think of XML as applying meaning to TCP/IP by wrappering it just as

I was hoping to attend the July 24th meeting but wasnt sure on the trains.  If i could get some type of directions using the trains from the babylon branch on longisland that would be great.

Thanks Hans.  My company LECHUON does a lot of work on NOLA and osCommerce
integration.  Hopefully, we can release fully functional software to the OS
community with NOLA, osC and CRM soon.  We don't know if we can provide the
documentation because most of us done speak English well enough to do
technical writing.  Everything is written in PHP and utilized MySQL dB.  We
can also use some strong developers, but we cannot afford to pay right now.
If anybody interested to join us at a principle level, please email me
directly at "lchuon at lechuon.com".  Sorry guys, only EXPERIENCE and serious
candidate please.  We also want can use some help on the front-end level.
We will try to customize NOLA UI.  Right now, it is very user-unfriendly
besides all the bugs that we uncovered.

New York PHP Presents:

"Implementing an Object-based Web Framework in PHP"

NYPHP's monthly meeting is a week away (7/24), and after an informal
networking event last month, we're excited to offer what certainly will
be a highly valuable presentation to many.

Web frameworks and object-orientated programming are forging the way
for increasingly functional Internet applications, and PHP is
continuing to be an integral part of the progress.  Two top developers
from Tanjero (http://tanjero.com) will be showing us how they've
leveraged the AMP Technology suite to quickly provide powerful, yet
reusable and cost-effective web applications for their clients.

NYPHP meetings are the 4th Wednesday of every month at 6:30pm, with
this meeting slated for 7/24.  Please visit http://nyphp.org for
location details, a map, and further information.

Thank you,

Hans Zaunere

I don't know the LI trains very well, but from looking at:

http://mta.info/lirr/html/lirrmap.htm

maybe something like this would work:

Babylon Branch -> Hicksville -> Port Jefferson Branch  -> Jamaica ->
NYC Transit (E/J/Z)? (http://mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm) -> Penn
Station

Once at Penn Station, take the C or E to 23rd street, then either a bus
or walk east to Digital Pulp (map available at http://nyphp.org).

I think there's a subway that's more direct from Jamaica to 23rd
Street, but I'm not sure - maybe someone else knows better about this.

Take the 1,2 or 3 to Uptown to 42nd street (1 stop), transfer to the 
shuttle to Grand Central Station, then take the 6 downtown to 23rd 
street. Walk east about 3 blocks (If I remember correctly).

I would recommend taking the LIRR straight into Penn Station (you should 
be able to pick a time that will avoid transferring at Jamaica), taking 
the E or C, and walking/cabbing/bussing east.

Anirudhsinh,

All are welcomed.  I want to be certain that everyone is cleared about one
thing.  You will not get pay for this project.  At this point, we are about
to complete NOLA and osC integration.  Many new features were added.  We
plan to integrate CRM and EZ Publisher to the suite.   If you are
interested, please let me know.  We want to be able to release this product
to the community in time of the recession.  As you know, there is very no IT
budget for 2002-2003.  Therefore, only experience developers (expertise in
ERP/CRM and CM is a plus) are needed at this time.  Sorry newbies.  You'll
get to hack the codes when we finish the product.

Hi there,

I'm new to the PHP NY group, but could you tell me a little more, or point
me to a URL regarding the CRM software - I've spent four years developing
CRM solutions in the UK using PHP and would like to get involved in the
project as I may be able to supply valuable input.

Is there likely to be a discussion at the next meeting about the project?
I'm in NYC for the next six weeks, so would be able to attend.

Kind Regards,
Wayne Cope

Hi,

Was wondering if anyone knew of any sites that may have a directory of
packaged software development companies in the NY metro area.

When I say packaged, I mean non-consulting, non-customization companies.
They create a software product and sell them.

Also, is there a U.S. association for these companies, and if so, what is
it's (or their) names.

Thanks.

As Ophir said, PEAR has a caching system, which uses shm:

http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2001/10/11/pearcache.html

And a lot of good stuff here:

http://www.php-accelerator.co.uk/

I'm sure a thorough search on http://sourceforge.net or
http://phpclasses.websapp.com would come up with some sample code as
well.  Also note that some software may be for caching pages already
created and some for caching DB results, but the shm mechanism should
be similar.

Consider that you may eat more CPU/memory/time walking through an array
than making a well formed query on an optimized table, especially if
we're talking two seperate machines.

Best bet is bugs.php.net for the status on that.

I personally use Maximizer at Indexstock.  There are not too many
open-source CRM that I am aware of.  So far, I have identified OpenCRM,
Relata (based on openCRM), TUTOS, Eden, and Compiere.  Unless someone else
show me a better CRM based on LAMP, we're going to integrate Relata into the
suite and add other features as we see fit.  We don't want to reinvent the
wheels.  We can definitely use your expertise on the subject.

Hi there,

I'm new to the PHP NY group, but could you tell me a little more, or point
me to a URL regarding the CRM software - I've spent four years developing
CRM solutions in the UK using PHP and would like to get involved in the
project as I may be able to supply valuable input.

Is there likely to be a discussion at the next meeting about the project?
I'm in NYC for the next six weeks, so would be able to attend.

Kind Regards,
Wayne Cope

Subject: phpSQLGen 0.3.0 released
Message-ID: <F198LmAx11WzhqLCNsl0001a494@hotmail.com>

phpSQLGen provides a library of functions for generating SQL queries from 
arrays and HTML tables from database result sets (ADOdb) or arrays.

For more information, see
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=XForum&file=viewthread&tid=2
http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsqlgen/
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/phpxref/phpsqlgen/index.php#documentation
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=djia&y=1998 (example program)

New in release 0.3.0:
1) improved integration between SQLGen and TableMaker (note in the example 
below how TableMaker uses the same $cols array that SQLGen uses to generate 
the query)
2) support for fetch mode num. This improves performance and cross-database 
compatibility, since some databases don't support the associative fetch mode
3) better handling of column headers (TableMaker)
4) better handling of "as" (SQLGen and TableMaker)
5) better handling of multiple-table selects (SQLGen)

Example program:

Subject: panamasuite - released v0.1.2 (PHP Portal Localization).
Message-ID: <200207181607.46623.matteo.rinaudo@tiscali.it>

Hi, folks.
This is Matteo Rinaudo from Cefal? (PA) Italy.
I wrote a PHP application called panamasuite 
(http://panamasuite.sourceforge.net).
I'd like your comments about it.

Portal AdvaNced Administration and Maintenance Application Suite is a package 
of PHP OOP components
such as classes, modular and ready-to-use web applications like locales 
support, connection to
databases, forum, newsletter, poll, faq, administrative control panel and 
other portal features).
IT SUPPORTS ONLY LOCALIZATION WITH CONTROL PANEL for NOW.
It simply uses PHP4 and MySQL. Interbase and other datasources will be easily 
implemented in the
future, thanks to the modular vision of the implementation method: the 
secondary classes inherit
from the main one the methods of database connections and query, and therefore 
it will be enough
to change the main class in order to approach to one various data source.

Best regards to all,
Matteo Rinaudo

Well, I'm 98% done with a clients' project and I just got a final change.  

Rather than go into the gory details here, if someone is curious about my dilemma they can contact me at peter at panvox.net.

It's quite probable that I'm simply missing something, but I fear I may have painted myself into a corner.

But that's what help lists are for.  The more people that see it, the more 
people that can help.  Of course, make sure you succinctly and clearly 
state the situation.  No one want's to read "War and Peace" here.

Allrighty then...

I have a food-costing application which takes data about a food item:
weights, costs, portion size, measurement equivalent, yield.  the end result
is that it determines how much it costs to produce a particular item.
Providing the user has kept the net cost current of all ingredients used of
course.

My client would like me to develop a form by which he can create his own
conversion.

So he'd like to say:
2 ounce = = 1 shmear

and have the system understand what a shmear is actually 2 ounces.

Thus my dilemma...I cn't for the life of me figure this out.

Thanks,

Just off the top of my head - I might create something like the following:

Create a couple tables in your database for conversions:

Table: Units
Column: unit_id
Column: unit_name
Column: unit_desc

Table: Equivilence
Column: equiv_id
Column: unit1_id
Column: unit2_id
Column: multiplier

Your equiv table will contain relationship information:
Example

Table: Units
Unit_id: 001
Unit_name: Shmear
Unit_desc: Dollap applied by knifelike utensil.

Table: Units
Unit_id: 002
Unit_name: Oz
Unit_desc: One Ounce

Table: Equivilence
Equiv_id: 0001
Unit1_id: 001
Unit2_id: 002
Multiplier: 2

This example shows that 1 Schmear is equal to 2 Oz's: Unit1 * Multiplier = Unit2.

Just a quick shot at it anyway - good luck!

Perhaps this idea would work...

Couldn't you simply create a "conversion table".

This table would then allow you to keep the new item (e.g. shmear), a
multiplier (e.g. 2) and a field that has a one-to-one relationship with
items in your measurements table (e.g. ounce).

That way, you could set up a form that would allow him to make a new
conversion item (force it to be unique) like "jigger".  He then would put in
a multiplier like 3.5 in a text box.  Finally he would select from a drop
down list the appropriate measurement, perhaps ounces.

Now, anywhere else in the application, you can show a jigger as 3.5oz.

You'll have to allow for the plural when listing it (e.g. the table might
show "ounce" but a "jigger" would need to show "ounces"), but I think it
could work with a relational DB behind you.

Apache is built in, all you need is PHP and mySQL. And there is a site that
makes it easy:

http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/

He's setup a really easy straightforward page or two to help you get them
installed.

Mac OS X just became the absolute best PHP development environment, IMHO. It
rocks.

Cheers,
Wes

Hey..pete..

well..if u can create this type of from, then u can store those conversion 
rates into database..and while generating calculations..u can retrive those 
figures and use..

however without knowing current functionality exactly it's diff to provie 
solution..

but as i told above u can use this type of solution...but u can't give..user 
to fill in conversion rates in free fromat like he can type

"1 ounce==2 smear" ..this is wrong..bcoz system can't figure out what does 
it mean...

instead u have to design your form in smart a way that user will never make 
mistake...like first u add all possible measurement units into database..

and when user want to add..some data then he can add conversion rates by 
below way

list box of   text filed        list box of
first unit    (which accepts    second units.
               numeric fig.)    (in which first to be convereted)

now by this way user can pick up..first unit then enters figure and then 
selects second unit..

now u can store all 3 items into db..and while calculating...or gennerating 
reports u can use stored figure and both conversion units for making correct 
conversion..

Thanks

My initial attempt a few days ago resembles Patricks' suggestion:
CREATE TABLE custom_conversion (
   custom_id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
   custom_name varchar(15) NOT NULL,
   custom_amt double DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
   custom_conv double DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
   custom_type varchar(15) NOT NULL,
   parent_amt double DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
   parent_conv double DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
   parent_type varchar(15) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (custom_id)
);


however the "mulltiplier" idea never occured to me...

Either way I think i'm getting a clearer picture now...

any more suggestions feel free to add them!!

if you like feel free to check out how the user would to define their
conversions here:

I too own an iBook, and I love it.  I agree with Wes, go to that 
entropy.ch page and use his software.  Some additional tips:

You might have to edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Look for all lines with php in them and uncomment them.
You may also have to add the following to the conf:
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

There is a binary mysql distro at www.yolke.com/oss
Its recommended by apple but I havent tried it.

I used entropy.ch's distribution but I followed these install 
instructions:
http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/osdb.html

Good luck and Yay for ibook.

hi,

you already have your multiplier:  it is your first amount over your second 
amount.  (Or vice versa depending on how it's used.  I'm looking at 
http://www.mainstreetsrestaurantgroup.com/msc/conversionBuilder.php).

So you can now convert to any weird unit, as Patrick explained (and i was about 
to send :), for presentation.  Otoh, save all amount data in native units so as 
not to complicate any of your other calculations on the data.

Hello everyone,

I was curious if anyone out there has had experience with any open source
e-commerce type applications or libraries. I have been looking at
Inrerchange, but do not really care for what seems to be its own
proprietary markup code. I need to build something extensible, but I would
prefer to not have to have to start from scratch. So any suggestions, or
pointers on where to look would be most appreciated. Something written in
PHP would be preferable.
I was looking at an application called 'pgmarket' and like the fact that
it is a template system and object oriented, but am not too keen on its
use of phplib.
Thanks again,
Alan

http://www.oscommerce.com - it's the latest version of the exchange project... Pretty slick.  There is also a version of PostNuke that has oscommerce functionality built in - I think it's available on
Freshmeat.

Subject: LiquidClassifieds 0.7.0 now available
Message-ID: <F152pc006Q24rM5AaSP0000aaf2@hotmail.com>

If this software package catches fire, maybe someday I can hire PHP 
programmers (there are quite a few enhancements I can envision)...a nice 
dream.  Maybe someday there will be world peace too.

Features
1) Fully automated. Users can register (via PostNuke), post, edit, and 
delete without your involvement.
2) Side block (so every page of your PostNuke site can show the ads)
3) Unregistered users can post, but cannot edit ads.
4) BBCode support
5) Categories
6) Easy to remember URLs like
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=liquidclassifieds,
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=liquidclassifieds&cat=forsale, and
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=liquidclassifieds&cat=forsale&id=1
7) Supported fields: title, body, state, city
8) Anonymous posting. Posters don't need to reveal their identities.
9) Registered users do not need to reveal their e-mail addresses. The person 
responding to the ad can fill out a contact form and then the system, which 
knows the e-mail addresses of registered users, will send an e-mail. 
Unregistered users should supply phone numbers (recommended) and/or e-mail 
addresses (not recommended because of spambots) in their postings.
10) Sorting by last modified timestamp
11) Modular design (only important for enterprise edition purchasers) - the 
same infrastructure was used to build journal, organizer, and cronmail.
12) Ownership re-assignment for un-registered postings. If an unregistered 
user posts an ad, and then a registered user edits it, it's ownership will 
be re-assigned to the registered user.

Limitations
1) Only two permision levels: registered user and unregistered user. There 
probably ought to be an admin level as well. All registered users have 
admin-like privileges - registered users can create new categories and edit 
or delete posts made by unregistered users.
2) No "paging." If you have 1000 listings in one category, the program will 
display all 1000 listings on the same page - it won't split the listings up 
into separate pages.
3) Slightly quirky user-interface
4) Not hierarchical (no support for sub-categories).

Pricing

--------------------------------------------------------------------

If this software package catches fire, maybe someday I can hire PHP 
programmers (there are quite a few enhancements I can envision)...a nice 
dream.  Maybe someday there will be world peace too.

Features
1) Fully automated. Users can register (via PostNuke), post, edit, and 
delete without your involvement.
2) Side block (so every page of your PostNuke site can show the ads)
3) Unregistered users can post, but cannot edit ads.
4) BBCode support
5) Categories
6) Easy to remember URLs like
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=liquidclassifieds,
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=liquidclassifieds&cat=forsale, and
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=liquidclassifieds&cat=forsale&id=1
7) Supported fields: title, body, state, city
8) Anonymous posting. Posters don't need to reveal their identities.
9) Registered users do not need to reveal their e-mail addresses. The person 
responding to the ad can fill out a contact form and then the system, which 
knows the e-mail addresses of registered users, will send an e-mail. 
Unregistered users should supply phone numbers (recommended) and/or e-mail 
addresses (not recommended because of spambots) in their postings.
10) Sorting by last modified timestamp
11) Modular design (only important for enterprise edition purchasers) - the 
same infrastructure was used to build journal, organizer, and cronmail.
12) Ownership re-assignment for un-registered postings. If an unregistered 
user posts an ad, and then a registered user edits it, it's ownership will 
be re-assigned to the registered user.

Limitations
1) Only two permision levels: registered user and unregistered user. There 
probably ought to be an admin level as well. All registered users have 
admin-like privileges - registered users can create new categories and edit 
or delete posts made by unregistered users.
2) No "paging." If you have 1000 listings in one category, the program will 
display all 1000 listings on the same page - it won't split the listings up 
into separate pages.
3) Slightly quirky user-interface
4) Not hierarchical (no support for sub-categories).

Pricing
Two versions are offered:
a) Standard edition: (includes obfuscated source code, installation help and 
7 days of support). Pricing is still being worked out, but will be in the 
hundreds of dollars. The code is designed to work with PostNuke, but can be 
adapted to work with PHP-Nuke, phpBB, etc. - though this may cost a little

more than one domain name.

help, and 30 days of support). Pricing is still being worked out, but will 
be in the thousands of dollars. Single domain name license - ask if you need 
to use the software with more than one domain name.

/dev/null  :)

While I'm joking, I'm also serious.  The only legitimate use for
Java'sCrap is mouseovers.  Relying on the browser/client for anything
isn't wise.

Most things done with JS can be done server side much more accurately.  
That's why you've subscribed to a PHP list, no?  :)

Message-ID: <200207181408.g6IE81P51120@slipdisc.virul.net>

Hi from Matteo Rinaudo.
I released a new version of a PHP application called panamasuite .
(http://panamasuite.sourceforge.net).
I'd like your comments about it.

Portal AdvaNced Administration and Maintenance Application Suite is a package 
of PHP OOP components
such as classes, modular and ready-to-use web applications like locales 
support, connection to
databases, forum, newsletter, poll, faq, administrative control panel and 
other portal features).
IT SUPPORTS ONLY LOCALIZATION WITH CONTROL PANEL for NOW.
It simply uses PHP4 and MySQL. Interbase and other datasources will be easily 
implemented in the
future, thanks to the modular vision of the implementation method: the 
secondary classes inherit
from the main one the methods of database connections and query, and therefore 
it will be enough
to change the main class in order to approach to one various data source.

Best regards to all,
Matteo Rinaudo

I find plenty of uses for JavaScript on the Client while still using PHP on
the server.  Form validations present nicer to the user when done on the
client, there's not that anoying flash caused by the server round trip, as
well as the delay on a slow connection.  JavaScript is also useful on the
client to update info in the client without making a full round trip to the
server ( ie. hidden frame refresh with javascript to copy the data to where
it needs to be ).  And then there's features like popup help ( although we
all know real programmers don't write help... ha ha ha... evil grin here ).
While I do try to minimize my Javascript on the client due to fear of
browser incompatibilities, I don't avoid it because it has it's place.

I agree to some extent ... one of the most hidden secret gems I find to

Thus I find Javascript *does* somewhere have a nice purpose besides 
beautiful rollovers :-)

You still need to do validation on the server anyway, so now you're 
maintaining two code bases.

Then, if the user has Java'sCrap turned off or not present, are they even
able to submit your form.  I've seen plenty of forms that won't.

But they all fall flat on their face when JS is off/unavailable, making 
your site unusable.

I disagree.  If there is a validation to be done on the client, I do it
there, no form
processing will allow submit without the data having been validated.

Haven't had a user complain yet, and I own my own software dev company in
which we have produced a number of web apps that use javascript.

> But they all fall flat on their face when JS is off/unavailable, making
> your site unusable.
True, but if the client wants to get rid of the page redraw & associated
delay
during validation, then you WILL do JS and let the client know that the app
will not work with JS turned off.  Once again, I refer to my above
statement, it's
never been a problem.

So, what's keeping me from saving your HTML to disk, editing it to remove
the Java'sCrap validation, refreshing, entering bogus data that'll mess up
your system into the reworked form and then submitting the form?  
Nothing.  Even if you do referrer checking, I can forge that.  In short,
if you want security, data must be validated on the server.

Perhaps because they figure it's not worth doing business with such a 
firm.  I certainly don't.

Nope.  If a firm doesn't trust my professional judgement, we're not meant 
to be doing business together.

First of all you can download the HTML and do what ever you want with it,
but unless you have FTP access to that server you will not be able to submit
that page and even if you change the action on the form, with in all my
scripts I check where the page is coming from and if is not from my domain
is not going to be executed.  Lets just face it there are many ways of doing
things if you don't like to use JavaScript to save time and resources that's
your purgative, but I've been doing it for years and it works fine for me
and my clients, and some of my clients do well over $100,000 a month  on
there sites.

Just one more opinion.

There's everything stopping you.  All my systems are built off a proprietary
security system which first ensures that the person submitting the form is
logged
into our system.  There are additional checks that ensure the sequential
integrity
of any submit.  So the only person who can make such an attack on one of
our systems must 1. be a good enough hack to know how to do something like
this.  2. want to mess up our systems.  3.  be a valid user in the system,
or
have the ability to hack into the system.  4.  have the ability to hack our
other
form security checks.  Can someone meet the bill?  Sure.  But how about
calculating the odds.  Then of course there is the database.  Our systems
have
many different validation checks on the db server.  From relational
integrity
checks to range checks to sequential integrity checks etc.  So now not only
does this hack need to do all the above, but he must figure out what bogus
data he can get away with putting into our system.

Is it foolproof?  Of course not, there's no such thing.  Is it good enough?
Depends
on who you talk to.  I have been in the business for 20 years.  Been in the
web
business for 9 years.  None of my customers have ever had a system hacked.
That
doesn't mean I can forget about security, it's just that why build Fort Knox
to ensure
someone doesn't steal my penny?  Writing custom applications ( which is all
I do ) changes completely how you program. I must be programming for the
needs
of the customer and within the budget of my customer.  When I first started
working
in the web environment I was major concerned that http was insecure and a
users ID & password were passed in the clear.  The threat of a lurker seemed
very
real.  Now we have https, and via various means ( many using JavaScript )
keep
the password secure.  Prior to having these solutions though, I never had a
problem with lurkers.  Didn't necessarily make the threat unreal, just put
the threat
into the perspective of how few people have the skill to lurk & pick out
specific
security related items, and how fewer still are the people who would want to
use
that skill to break into a proprietary data system.

So, if I want security, I can still validate on the client.

I didn't ask you to business with my company.  You have your choice.  I have
been
very successful without you so far!  And even if you wanted to do business
with my
company, it's totally up to you what tech we use for you.  If you want zero
javascript,
so be it.  We will explain the design issues that would be affected by such
a decision
as well as any monetary changes.  You get to choose as the customer what you
want and if you want to pay for Fort Knox to protect your penny, then we
will build
Fort Knox for you so long as you pay.

Dan, I'm sorry you take such a hostile approach to application development.
Our
clients pay to have applications developed the way they want them.  If my
clients
don't want to respect my professional judgement, that's thier business, I
don't have
to pay for there foolery, they do.  I am more than willing to profit off of
a fool so long
as I have vindicated myself by warning of the foolishness of something I am
about
to do on their behalf.  In fact I have received much more business with this
approach.  I warn them of the danger, they ignore me, they pay for their
ignorance,
they remember that I warned them and are now willing to trust my
professional
judgement much more.

While JS may not be full-proof, it can at least be a first attempt to

junk data, thus helping to lessen the demands on the server.

That's not really accurate.  Javascript, CSS, and DHTML are all very
useful if you know what you are doing.  Browser detection makes it
possible to implement client side languages without worrying as much
about widespread compliance.  The drawback being longer interface
development time as you would have to design UI for multiple levels of
compliancy.  With this setup and the good client side coding, you can
save the user time in reloading a page or make it easier and more
interactive to perform a task, thus saving bandwidth and other system
resources.

While I'm joking, I'm also serious.  The only legitimate use for
Java'sCrap is mouseovers.  Relying on the browser/client for anything
isn't wise.

Most things done with JS can be done server side much more accurately.

Bruce,

I think so.  I have done some work with "applets" in PHP that cry out for
client-side scripting, so I did exactly that.  One example was a time sheet
"applet" that required the ability to permit the user to move easily from
field to field, show live running totals of hours, etc.  I used PHP to
generate the page with the timesheet and to connect to the underlying
database, and JavaScript to allow "immediate" client interaction.  This
required some JavaScript to be embedded in the PHP... a little kludgey, but
it worked.  Lacking client-side PHP, this seems to me to be the best way to
try to do Java applet-like things with PHP.

Cheers,
Fred Woolsey

"What we have here is a failure to communicate."  FTP has nothing to do
with this.  I'm not editing the script on the server.  I edit the HTML
form on my hard drive, view the form from my hard drive using my web
browser, enter the data into it, click on the submit button, an HTTP
connection is opened to the web server I got the form from, all of the
data I entered into my hacked form is sent over that HTTP connection and
passed to the target script on the your server, just as if I submitted the
form that was on your server.


> with in all my

While that's good, it's not fool proof.  I can throw an HTTP_REFERER into 
my request headers that contains the URI that you'd expect.

Maintaining two validation code bases (client side and server side)  
doesn't save time.  And not maintaining server side validation is 
insecure, therefore it's not a way things should be done.

Enjoy,

Additionally, if you are designing Intranet apps, or at least apps where you
can specify what browser and version must be used (e.g., for use by a
specific group of users, such as employees of a single company), coding is
simplified by having a known client interface.  And, while it is indeed true
that data must in any case be checked at the server, it isn't a bad idea to
protect against innocent mistakes (like typos) on the client.  Rejecting
client-side scripting out of hand for straw-man reasons isn't a good idea.

Say what Dan? .... Wrong Wrong Wrong ....
I agree with Kyle. 
JavaScript is used to keep the load on the servers low!
If you know what your doing, you can accomplish many things with Jscript.
Validation, Dynamic menu's, Browser checking, etc...
If I had to do all this on the server ... I would have a farm stretching 
from NYC to Atlanta, GA .... You do need to make sure that your jscripts
are compliant with browsers. Get something like dhtmllib and your set.
The more you can use the visitors web-browser, the more you save on server 
processing, which means less servers, which means less money to spend on 
your hardware infrastructure, which means a happy CTO!
Don't know what kind of hit volume you guys get at analysisandsolutions,
but if you guys want a 15 billion http request ratio, you better rethink 
your coding strategy! 
Don't get me wrong, PHP is good at certain things ... no even better ... 
many things!
But there are many languages out there that have their pro's and cons.
Don't get to focused on one language to much ...

Ah.  From the initial post, it wasn't clear you were talking about an 
intranet.  Sure, that secures you from outside crackers.  But, that 
doesn't save you from malicious employees, which are responsible for the 
vast majority of attacks.

Agreed.  All of what I'm talking about is unlikely, but possible.

I'm not talking about putting in bogus data.  I'm talking about totally 
screwing up the system.  Let's say your intranet form updates the name of 
a user.  The user input is used to create a query string:

  UPDATE Users SET Name='$Name' WHERE UserID=$UserID

$UserID is usually a number.  But, what if the system allows me to alter
$UserID to be "3; DELETE FROM Users WHERE 1=1"  If your db permits
multiple queries in one request, then there goes all your data.

Or, if someone puts "'3'" into $UserID and your database doesn't like that
and your script doesn't gracefully capture the error, sensitive server
configuration information could be revealed.

Then there are buffer overflow possibilities.  If the size of user input
isn't checked, they could sumit some outrageiously long string which could
trip up some function in the receiving script or database server _IF_ (of
course) one of those components has a vulnerability.  But, as we all know, 
vulnerabilities do pop up all the time.

But putting data validation into an application doesn't add all that much

Misunderstanding here...  I'm not talking about my hiring you to design a
site for me.  I'm talking about retail websites I come across on the net.  
They're in business to sell things to the public.  If I need JS to do
buisiness with them, I take my business elsewhere.

I hear you.  I don't like having my name associated with projects I can't 
stand behind.

I do have one, though.  The backend and interface I created rocks, but the
stuff the client is doing is lame.  But I'm getting _PAID_, if you know 
what I mean. :)

Enough for now...

Sorry to interupt, and I don't wish to sound rude - but this is getting a
little petty.

At the end of the day there are good point and bad points to all languages -
and good reasons for doing some things on the client, and others on the
server.  So long as the security model is sufficient for the application in
hand, and all potential risks given the sensitivity of the data or
functionality being secured are removed sufficiently then who cares what
method is used, or where the validation occurs - it's all application
specific, and there should be no specific rule.  Guidelines yes, but rules
no.

At the end of the day, the chap simply asked for help on some JavaScript -
and he got that off a few kind people out there, and thereafter the whole
issue completely lost it's context and turned into silly banter.

However - to have started a discussion on security issues in general, i.e.
discussing the pro's and con's of client side and server side validation
would have been a good step, but there's no need to be derogative about any
specific languages because that simply leads to people being argumentative,
and constructive criticism is lost.

Bye for now...

I tend not to use javascript much at all.
for validation, I usually do light validation (syntax, not empty, is email,
etc) w/ JS and heavy w/ php (error checking, etc).
It's useful for DHTML stuff...but can be combursome. 
What I think it is useful for though...is for gui enhancements.
For example: I had a client recently, that wanted to pull address from a
database table to populate a form. W/O JS, this was a three step process,
with PHP loaded JS, it became a 1 step process. 

Everything has it's place, and once you realize the right place for
everything...you become a better developer. 

JS defineately has it's purpose. But I don't think it should be used for
everything. Lets use the right tool for the right job...and save the other
tools for the other jobs.

While I don't disagree with the post, I'd just like to point out the the 
PHP MySQL functions (I don't know about other databases) will only 
process the first SQL statement passed, preventing such exploits.

Entire GUIs can be written in JavaScript. If you can control the
environment (for example, it's corporate intranet), compatibility is
not an issue. I'm one of developers of SiteSupra (www.sitesupra.com),
and we've built complete application in JavaScript, with server
connections and other advanced stuff.

Aparently not vast enough for my clients to pay for increased security.  I'm
also not dealing strictly intranet.  Some of the systems I have been a part
of
have included subscription services over the internet, data query systems,
and specialized e-commerce solutions.  In all cases my clients have always
asked for a login process which allows tracking who is doing what & allows
an admin choosing what parts of the system a user can get to.

> > Can someone meet the bill?  Sure.  But how about calculating the odds.
> Agreed.  All of what I'm talking about is unlikely, but possible.
Yes, possible.  But not such a rampant problem as to dismiss out of hand
the use of JavaScript validation without server side validation as a huge
problem.  Depending on what my client wants and is willing to pay determines
what level of validations they will get.  My initial low cost approach is
server
side validation only.  If they don't want the refresh between validation and
the error, or want field level validations rather than form level
validations, then
I go for the javascript validations.  If they want both the cleaner GUI and
the extra security of ensuring a malicious person doesn't attempt to put in
stuff, then I go for both.

This is relying on a knowledge of the code on the server.  The assumption
is that multiple queries can be done in one request.  I must admit, all the
work
I have done in the past has been via ASP, JSP, and proprietary Java Servers
in which multiple queries is not an option.  PHP is a newer technology for
my
company, and I was unaware that a PHP query could allow multiple queries in
one statement.  Your vulnerability also assumes that the data field is at
the
end of the statement. Without knowledge of the server side code, an intruder
is just playing in the dark in the hopes of finding a field that ends the
statement
so they can tag along another malicious query.  Once again, it comes down
to all things are possible, but if I am always programming for every
possibility, I
will never get a completed application.  As a programmer I must choose the
level of safety in my code that I am attempting to achieve & program for
that.
Once again also, what the client is willing to pay certainly determines how
much
code safety they will get.

Yes.  In any situation where we have rules defined on the server we require
proper error handling to insolate the user from the internals.

Yes. And there are every other possiblity as well.  I would hate to see the
code
that deals with every possiblity.

I put no more effort into an application than what the customer is willing
to pay.
And this whole thing started with your attitude that maintaining 2 code sets
were unacceptable, that having javascript validations on the client, and php
or
some other validation on the server is a waste of time and effort.  If you
are
successful at your business ignoring the benefits of Javascript, than that
is your
business.  I am glad you are so successful.  But don't denegrate the
successes of
others who use Javascript on the client, or who choose to safety down their
code
because that's what a client wants.  Especially when this thread was started
by
a request for a newsgroup which deals in Javascript.  Your response seemed
very negative against Javascript as if a programmer is not worth his salt if
he
chooses to use javascript.

Yes, misunderstanding.  But your taking your business elsewhere just because
a web vendor requires JS is your choice and a choice I am sure web vendors
consider when they choose to put JS into their web apps.  Seeing the
preponderance of JS assisted web sites, I would be led to beleive that the
average vendor considers this of little importance, or have the money to
provide
both a rich JS assisted GUI and a less rich HTML only GUI.  Just the same,
this is not of my concern, I do not make my money off the apps, I make my
money off the development of the apps.  My client chooses the technology
they
are comfortable with.  BTW, I had an ASP client who was anti-JS. I developed
and app or 2 for them that has a pure HTML GUI with some CSS mixed in.
They asked for a particular type of application which my company has done
before so I pointed them to the URL to see the app.  They saw the app, loved
it,
wanted a similar app.  As we discussed the app, they would say they wanted
it to work like the other app, but we would have to say, well, that feature
is done
with Javascript, so we would have to rewrite that feature without the
Javascript
and we couldn't guarantee that the replacement GUI would be as responsive
or user friendly.  They initially accepted that until they saw the time
estimate.
It's funny how a price tag can change a clients mind about a technology.  We
ended up doing the project with the JS.

Yes, and that's my whole point.  I don't always like what I have to develop,
I don't
always like what my clients are willing to settle for.  I have developed
applications
that I WILL NOT use as promo for future reference.  But the bottom line is,
I am
a computing whore.  You pay me the money, I give you what YOU want, not what
I want.

Hey, hope I haven't come on too strong, this is all in the name of open
discussion
on development strategy etc.

Have a great JS free weekend.  ( although right now in NJ it's dumping major
buckets of water, boo hoo )

hear hear!

That's the big problem of todays development environments.  I need to know
HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript and a bunch of other 3 letter acronyms for the
client, PHP/ASP/ASP.net/JSP/Java/Servlets/Cold Fusion/Perl/C or any other
poison of choice on the server sprinkled with SQL( many flavors depending
on the target server ) as well as enterprise distributed techs like Corba or
EJB.

Just one small internal project I'm working on uses HTML, CSS, JS, PHP,
mySQL.  All for just 1 small project.  Sheesh.

That's very good to know.  As you see in my answer, I was unaware of this
vulnerability since most of my experience lies in environments that don't
allow this.  It kind of scared me to know that possibility existed in PHP.
So far my foray's in PHP have been with mySQL, so I hope you are
correct on the first query only thing.

As is the case with most PHP functionality [extensions], it's based on
the C API.  MySQL's core C API doesn't support multiple query strings
per query command (what DBs natively do now that I think about it?). 
As a result, you'll get a parse error at the ';' after trying to run
such a query string and then calling print mysql_error($db);

A problem, however, is leaving parameters out:

DELETE FROM atable WHERE id=''

or improper escaping:

DELETE FROM atable WHERE firstname LIKE '%'

As an aside, as I'm sure many have noticed, phpMyAdmin does support
multiple queries per "form box".  This is an application level feature
of phpMyAdmin.

A strictly JS authentication system is a BAD idea.  There are several
ways to get around it.  If you are going to use JS to authenticate data
it should only be to save the user or your servers stress.  There should
be always be server side checking as well... well unless you really
don't give a.

Thanks for the offer Hans.

Sorry to stir up such a debate earlier, but I still do need help. :-)
Maybe someone can assist me. I'm actually just learning PHP and was 
hoping to concentrate on that before learning anything else. But it 
seems I may not have a choice.

I'm thinking this can only be done with JavaScript, but maybe I'm wrong.

Is there a way I can get form values that are on the same html page as a 
form but outside of the form tags, and then pass them along with the 
rest of a forms values when a submit button of a form is clicked? The 
page must contain multiple forms. Each form will contain different 
hidden values and a submit button.  The form values outside of the form 
tags will be associated with every form on the page which is why they 
must also be sent along with the rest of the particular form's hidden 
values.  To help illustrate this I've included and commented the HTML 
code I'm using below.

Many thanks to anyone who could help out!

<p>STEP 1. ENTER YOUR DOMAIN NAME:

Subject: metrocard dilema
Message-ID: <1065.128.238.4.221.1027157562.squirrel@students.poly.edu>

Ok i am writing this out of my frustration of losing $1.50 due to fun pass.
 It is quite a programing dilema.

MTA rule : fun pass expires at 3am next day after it is being used.
Simple enough right but what i been out and coming home late at night. Also
i live on staten island and am taking ferry.  so i am comming from brooklyn
i have to go to manhatten and then take the ferry that is if i catch the
boat on time which goes once an hour at night then on the other side in
staten island i have to swipe the metrocard to get on the train.  By the
time i get there its past 3am ($4 dollar pass being useless).

So why not have this fun pass realy be for 1DAY that is 24 hours after
activation at any time of the day.  Say i started using it at 4pm it should
last till 4pm next day.

I dont know the details of how the metrocard system works but i imagine it
has the simplest implementations. Metrocard probably has 3 states inactive,
active, expired.  What moves it from active to expired is the 3am cut off
time. Also the date has to be checked.  Making the cards 24 hours would
require puting a time stamp on the card after it is being used.  I dont see
whats so much more complicated about that ?  This mta policy seems realy
whacked out.  Anyone see this differently ?

As far as I know, the only way to get data outside a form to be sent with
the request
would be the use of JS either to build it as part of the querystring, or to
finagle some
form elements.

But, based on what you have below, I don't see that you need all those
forms, why not
just one form.  If it's a matter of determining which submit button the user
chose, then
give each submit button a different value, the selected button's value would
be associated
with the button field item available on the server side which would then let
you know
which of your hidden fields to use.  For example:

<p>STEP 1. ENTER YOUR DOMAIN NAME:
<form action="https://domain.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="OptionName" value="Domain">
<input type="text" name="OptionValue" size="25"></p>

 <p>STEP 2. CHOOSE A PLAN:</p>
<p>PLAN A 3 MONTHS
<input type="hidden" name="item1" value="PA03">
<input type="hidden" name="amount1" value="74.85">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit1"></p>

<p>PLAN A 6 MONTHS
<input type="hidden" name="item2" value="PA06">
<input type="hidden" name="amount2" value="137.70">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit2"></p>

<p>PLAN A 12 MONTHS
<input type="hidden" name="item3" value="PA12">
<input type="hidden" name="amount3" value="239.40">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit3"></p>
</form>

Thanks for the advice Jim, but when a button is clicked I need only one 
of the hidden "item" and one of the hidden "amount" values to be passed 
to the cart.

Thanks,
Steve

Where is the problem with passing all the items?  If $submit == "submit1"
then use $item1 and $amount1 if $submit =="submit2" then use $item2 and
$amount2.

Based on your example also, couldn't item & amount be put into a table &
based on which button the user pushes determines which record to look up to
populate item and amount?

If you can't do all this on the server, then JS looks the way to go.  I
would still use 1 form, except the submit button would call a JS user
function passing the 2 values.  The function would then take the 2 values
and put them in the fields.  So long as the button is a submit, the submit
will happen after the JS user function.  Look at below example.  I just
typed this off the top of my head, so if it doesn't work, you'll know why.
Hopefully it gives you the idea though.

Jim

Yeah... I'm going to throw in filtering "subscribe" and "unsubscribe"

Bravo Jim!  Your "off the top of the head" JavaScript worked excellently!
I even added some additional hidden fields to it and I didn't mess it 
up. LoL
Seems like when I'm ready to actually start learning JS (after I master 
PHP of course) it won't be that difficult.

Thanks for all your help! ;-)

Jim is right on here.  I'd even save a step.  Make the value of $submit 
an integer, then use that integer to create the name of a variable 
variable, from which you get the needed data.

Form...
   <input type="hidden" name="item2" value="PA03" />
   <input type="submit" name="submit" value="2" />

Script...
   $itemvar = "item$submit";
   echo 'item chosen is: ' . $$itemvar;

This eliminates the need to go through a lot of if or switch statements
and makes it easy to add and remove items because you don't need to 
update those if or switch statements.

Again, Jim is on target.  This is really the way to go for several
reasons.  Most importantly, -- yes, I'm bringing this back to the data
vaidation thread :) -- it keeps people from editing the cost before
submitting the form.  Also, it obviates the need for any hidden fields
at all by allowing you to just put the product ID value into the submit
buttons, like this:

   <input type="submit" name="ProductID" value="PA03" />

If you don't have database access, you can keep the product information 
in a text file or an include file.

Enjoy,

Hadn't thought of the variable variable, yes, this would cut the code on
the server way down.  The more I play with PHP, the more I'm liking it!

Hi all,

No problem using sessions as such, but I'm over-riding the default read,
write, destroy functions used for sessions so that when a session is
destoyed I ncan set a flag in a database pertinent to the session.

All works fine except if the browser is closed or something unfortunate
happens and the connection is lost etc., the server doesn't seem to
acknowledge that the session has died and promptly fails to run the destroy
code.  If I explicity call the session_destroy() function everything works
fine.

In ASP it's pretty much taken for granted that the session destory code
equivalent is called when a session ends, wether it be closed explicitly, by
expiry, or by closing the browser or some other method of loosing the
session with the server.

Does anybody know how I can achieve what I'm trying to do - yes I could pop
some JavaScript to detect closing the browser, but that doesn't account for
loss of connection etc.

Any help much appreciated.

Wayne....

I remember briefly looking into this at one point as well...maybe if you
can find a software vendor who produces an OS, web server, scripting
language AND browser, then you might be in luck ;)

Microsoft does all that and more ;-)

OS -> Windows
web server -> IIS
srcipting language -> ASP
browser -> IE

Doesn't mean it works in your favor in this instance (or in any other IMHO).

They should expire after the given time depending on how you reconfigured
it. If it doesn't seem to have expired after the configured time try
reloading a few times. For performance reasons the script doesn't run
after every connection, it is usually ran on a probability of say 1 of 100
hits. Maybe that is your problem?


Don't dream it. Be it.

details about the vulnerability from the php site.:

PHP 4.2.2 released in response to vulnerability

[22-Jul-2002] The PHP Group today announced the details of a serious vulnerability in PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. A security update, PHP 4.2.2, fixes the issue. Everyone running affected versions of PHP is encouraged to upgrade immediately. The new 4.2.2 release doesn't include other changes, so upgrading from 4.2.1 is safe and painless. 


PHP Security Advisory: Vulnerability in PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1

[ Version Fran?aise ] 

Issued on:    July 22, 2002
Software:    PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1
Platforms:    All

The PHP Group has learned of a serious security vulnerability in PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. An intruder may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. This vulnerability may be exploited to compromise the web server and, under certain conditions, to gain privileged access.
Description

PHP contains code for intelligently parsing the headers of HTTP POST requests. The code is used to differentiate between variables and files sent by the user agent in a "multipart/form-data" request. This parser has insufficient input checking, leading to the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can send HTTP POST requests to an affected web server. Both local and remote users, even from behind firewalls, may be able to gain privileged access.
Impact

Both local and remote users may exploit this vulnerability to compromise the web server and, under certain conditions, to gain privileged access. So far only the IA32 platform has been verified to be safe from the execution of arbitrary code. The vulnerability can still be used on IA32 to crash PHP and, in most cases, the web server.
Solution

The PHP Group has released a new PHP version, 4.2.2, which incorporates a fix for the vulnerability. All users of affected PHP versions are encouraged to upgrade to this latest version. The downloads web site at

http://www.php.net/downloads.php

has the new 4.2.2 source tarballs, Windows binaries and source patches from 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 available for download.

Workaround

If the PHP applications on an affected web server do not rely on HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST requests on the web server.

In the Apache web server, for example, this is possible with the following code included in the main configuration file or a top-level .htaccess file:

      <Limit POST>
         Order deny,allow
         Deny from all
      </Limit>

Note that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have parameters contradicting the example given above.

Credits

The PHP Group would like to thank Stefan Esser of e-matters GmbH for discovering this vulnerability.

Message-ID: <F2145bOPsWPCrEIIjKh00013805@hotmail.com>

Hello Steven

well u can do so

but don't put from vars outside from tag.

when u want to transfer vars of 1 from to other or so..

use javascipt method or properties like this

document.FROM1.VARNAME.value=document.FROM2.VARNAME.value;

so put your global 2-3 vars in 1 main form tag and then pass them  values to 
other forms using javascript.

or so..this is just simple example..u pls explore more on this.

Thanks

Subject: Mom and Pop CC Security
Message-ID: <B961BA85.4781%jim@nettmedia.com>


Hi all,

Let's say a user fills in his/her credit card number into a web form and
then submits the form via https to a secure server.

The user's order and credit card info are stored in a mySQL database.

Then, the owner of the site goes to a dynamic page which also lives on the
same secure server. This page lists all the orders and the credit card
numbers.

The owner then processes the credit card order by hand in hes/her shop and
deletes and marks the order as processed.

What security holes exist in this scenario?

This is a tad complex, but security and efficiency are always an inverse 
relationship.
I don't believe in storing the entire credit card number anywhere. If 
this is a mom and
pop shop, then maybe all the transactions will be done at the end of the 
day of possibly
bi-daily. I'd set up a routine where the CC# is stored and displayed 
with the last 4 numbers missing.
A file with the last 4 numbers and the transaction number is kept 
somewhere else, on the
same server if need be. The file could then be printed out. By using the 
transaction number
the store owner would know the full CC# without it ever being displayed 
on the screen.
Not the most secure method, but add encryption, algorithms to determine 
the transaction number,
etc., and this can be much more secure. Otherwise, trojans can easily be 
used to steal dozens
of CCs.

There are of course many variables, but here are some things I've run
into, dealing with medical data:

Assuming proper configuration, this should be as solid as one would
expect.

How does the data get from webserver -> MySQL?  Same physical box?
Encrypted?  We've been looking at MySQL 4.x for p-t-p SSL encryption.

Is the owner's access via SSL as well?  Is his computer secure?  Is his
computer shared by anyone/in a public area?  Is the data cached at all
(browser/proxy)?

> The owner then processes the credit card order by hand in hes/her

Of course security is only as good as the people that use the system!

> What security holes exist in this scenario?

This is just a start.  How secure are the boxes themselves?  The
network?  Are they running latest/secured php/apache/ssh/etc?  Physical
security?  Who has access/administers them?  Are the backup tapes/media
secured, physically?

This may pedantic, but we've been dealing with medical data, and thus
HIPPA regulation, so I'm learning to be extremely anal about things.

In any setup, you want to rule out as many variables as you can. This 
ideally means using multiple machines. Your database should not be 
directly exposed to the internet, it should be behind a firewall and the 
firewall should be set to control what computers can access the database 
machine through which ports. That reduces the "variables" considerably 
and is fairly easy to implement.

For instance, my setup looks something like this:
internet <-> firewall <--> web & mail servers <--> firewall <--> LAN

On top of all that, you still have your os, web and database security 
levels in place. It takes a bit of effort to come up with all the 
security policies you want, but once you do, it's easy to maintain.

Hi all,

No problem using sessions as such, but I'm over-riding the default read,
write, destroy functions used for sessions so that when a session is
destoyed I ncan set a flag in a database pertinent to the session.

All works fine except if the browser is closed or something unfortunate
happens and the connection is lost etc., the server doesn't seem to
acknowledge that the session has died and promptly fails to run the destroy
code.  If I explicity call the session_destroy() function everything works
fine.

In ASP it's pretty much taken for granted that the session destory code
equivalent is called when a session ends, wether it be closed explicitly, by
expiry, or by closing the browser or some other method of loosing the
session with the server.

Does anybody know how I can achieve what I'm trying to do - yes I could pop
some JavaScript to detect closing the browser, but that doesn't account for
loss of connection etc.

Any help much appreciated.

Wayne....

Hi Folks:

I promise the following will be my final foray on this subject... :)

First, I'm sorry if I've come off as nasty.  That's certainly not my
intention.  But I _really_ don't like JavaScript.  Allow me to clarify
exactly why.

JS has opened up a wide array of vulnerabilities.  Putting the words
"javascript" and "vulnerability" into Google brought up over 31,000 hits:
http://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+vulnerability.  The bugs include
situations where the JS engine in the browser has flaws that cause
exploitable crashes.  Other problems arise from nasty scripts doing
nepharious things, such as cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.  
Cross-site errors have arisen in notable programs such as Cold Fusion and
PHPNuke.  Here are some searches on this matter...

http://www.google.com/search?q=php+cross+site+scripting+vulnerability
brought back 6,800 hits.

http://online.securityfocus.com/search?submit=yes&category=23&order=DESC&query=cross%20site%20scripting
landed 237 pages.

So, this is not a small problem. The best way to keep such things from
happening is to keep JavaScript turned off.  I do.

The problem arises when landing on websites that require JS in order to do
essential things like click on hyperlinks, forward users to other pages or
submit forms.  While instances of JS can be convenient for the developers
and often provide a pretty interface, they needlessly restrict the
usefulness of the site.

These simple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities bring me back to an
earlier post:

I'd consider a web discussion forum to be down in that low economic impact
area.  But, if the system doesn't check user input on the server before
saving it, users can get unpleasant cross-site coding saved that will
spring up every time someone views their posting.  This has no economic
impact on the server or the people running it, but it poses problems for
the people viewing the site.  So, pennies need to be protected.

True for now.  But, there's no guarantee that'll always be the case -- be
it intentional or mistakenly.

I don't see what's the big deal about doing some basic validation for each
bit of user input.  Here's my basic method:

   #  Start out by creating an array to hold problem notices.
   $Probs = array();

   #  Now, examine the various variables submitted.
   #  For example, check $Data to see that it's an integer.
   #  I do the substr() to keep the possible points of
   #  overflow failure down to one simple function.
   $Data = substr($Data, 0, 6);
   if ( !preg_match('/^[0-9]{1,6}$/', $Data) ) {
      $Probs[] = 'Data was not an integer';
   }

   #  Finally, before inserting the data into your system,
   #  make sure there weren't any problems.
   if ( empty($Probs) ) {
      #  Life is good.  Proceed.
   } else {
      #  Ya got a problem.
      echo 'There were problems...<ul>';
      while ( list(,$Prob) = each($Probs) ) {
         echo "<li>$Prob</li>\
";
      }
      echo '</ul>';
   }

This process is really simple and eliminates all data corruption.
In my eyes, it's so easy, there's no reason not to do it.

Yep.  And, as it turns out, it seems Steve went with a JavaScript answer
despite both you and I put forth PHP based solutions.  Now there's one
more page on the net that's inaccessible to those w/o JS.

Anyway, ENOUGH!  Hope to see some of you on Wednesday.

And yet as another poster pointed out, you use JavaScript on your website
for flyovers.  I realize that the website will still work with JS turned
off, but for
someone so dead against JS, I would think you would not want to support
even the simplist use of JS especially since you can't even see the JS
impact on your website since JS is turned off in your browser.

This same thing can be said about alot of technologies, but do we stop
using a technology because there are potential vulnerabilities?

Take for example stylized e-mails.  I can send very professional looking
e-mails with tables, graphics etc.  I have yet to have a customer complain
that they can't see my e-mails the way it was intended to be viewed because
they have stylized text turned off.  And yet even with JS turned off,
stylized
text is relied on by spammers to find active e-mail addresses so they can
spam you some more.  They send an e-mail with graphics that are not
embedded in the e-mail but are linked to a site.  As far as your concerned
it saves on the size of the e-mail on initial delivery.  To the spammer, the
moment you read the e-mail, they get a hit on their web server for you to
DL the picture, and they get your e-mail address which allows them to know
it's active.

I did not say pennies do not need to be protected, I implied that pennies do
not need to be protected with a vault with a protected ventilation system
and
a pressure sensitive floor and sound level alarms and walls thick enough
to withstand a nuclear blast and guards out the wazoo.  I'm glad to protect
my penny by putting it into my piggy bank in my house which is locked when
I am not home.  Can someone steal my penny?  Sure, they can break in to
my house & the poor piggy bank is toast.  They can hope to also rely on
me being lazy sometimes and not locking up because I'm just running around
the corner to rent a video.  But I can guarantee that someone desiring to
break into my house is not doing it for the penny, it's not worth their
effort,
they want my VCR & DVD & TV & Stereo & Computer & the wife's jewelry
etc.  And yet, even though all those things are more valuable to me than
that little penny, I still rely on protecting it with a locked house in a
peaceful
safe community.  The statistics of breakins in my neighborhood run in at
under 10 per year in a community of thousands.  Under the circumstances
I would look foolishly parinoid to spend thousands of dollars to get the
best home alarm system available, especially when that money can be
far better spend on important things like my kids college fund.  Yeah, I can
be a little more parinoid without looking foolish, so I can go ahead and
get the el-cheapo alarm system to assuage my parinoia.

This is the same in software development.  There are vulnerabilities around
every corner.  Did you hear the latest PHP vulnerability?  Well maybe we
should stop using PHP because it has proven that it too can be compromised.
It's nice that there was a patch for it very quickly, but the fact that
there was
a potential vulnerability, and hackers could have exploited that
vulnerability
for the few months that it was exposed makes PHP potentially dangerous
and casts the light of doubt that there may be other vulnerabilities that I
am
unaware of but the hackers are.

And that is the case for any technology.  So long as technology continues
to advance, there are new vulnerabilities being built as we speak, and
new existing vulnerabilities being discovered and exploited.  So I might
as well get out of the industry because there's a vulnerability just around
the corner that's going to kill my busness.  I think maybe I'll go into
farming,
now there's a wholesome job where hackers can't destroy my business.
Oh no, there's pests looking to eat my crops, and health extremists who
won't let me use pesticides to protect my crop.  And even mother nature
is standing against me looking to destroy my crop...  Maybe if I just don't
work, yeah, that's the ticket...

I don't either, but I also don't see the big deal with using JS to do basic
validation on the client because my client wants it.  I make my money
making my clients happy, not making myself happy.

You are also using some basic methods which still can't deal with every
possibility.

  I personally avoid
JS when I can, beyond the visual enhancements, but there are times you
cannot avoid it.  Take for example the guy who took my JS solution over
the server side solutions suggested by us both.  I suspect that he
was having to submit form data to an already existing web site which
meant having to submit the data in the fashion that existing web site
expects.  With a very simple JS he was able to do what he needed. Now
he could have avoided JS and still met the other web sites form interface
by submitting his own form to his own website which then did lookups
or whatever to convert the form data into the expected data, then submit
the form from the server to this existing web site, then retreive the
results
and hand it back to the client, but that is so much more work.

> This process is really simple and eliminates all data corruption.
> In my eyes, it's so easy, there's no reason not to do it.

This doesn't point out the repopulation of the form with the data as entered
by the user, nor does it point out the code necessary to highlight the
fields
in question.  Both of these points on a complicated form can lead to a
few extra hours of development.  These are features that my clients almost
always ask for.  If I am using client side validations, I don't need to
repopulate
the form, the form is never replaced.  with client side validations,
changing
the color of a cell is also quite simple.  If I also do the server side
validations,
I can usually ignore having to code the form repopulation and error
highlighting
because I know that my server side validation is only there to protect
against
a hacker.  I know that the normal use of my form cannot produce invalid data
so why bother with the form repopulation code on the server.

And as simple as your script is, it does not validate the data itself, does
not
take into account range checks, and lookups to see if the data exists( ie.
on
the client I can populate a dropdown with valid choices, that ensures the
user selectes a valid choice.  A hacker can submit whatever they want that
may be the right data type, and in the right range, but not a valid choice )

export the excel file as a tab-delimited file and use the import file
feature of mysql.

Ken,
I think there's a pretty simple script you can write to do this for you.
First you'll need to save your MS Excel file as a tab-delimited text file.
(Run away from that M$ garbage).
Then, simply open your text file; read in a line - use the tab as a token
separator and fill in the values.
I assume you know the number of rows in your data but you could generate
that dynamically.
While there's still data left in the text file, generate your SQL insert
statements and populate the DB.
Hope this works for you. (It works in theory! ;) )
Jonathan

I had a similar problem.  You will have to clean up the CSV document that
Excel exports.  It's not in a "standard" output.  I had to replace " with '
to get it to work.

My only excuse is that I'm in DC this week. However, posted minutes after
the fact, ( or posted presentations or whatnot) would be appreciated for
those who are active in the list, but cannot make all the meetings!

The most help I can offer (I don't have a car!) is go to
http://nyphp.org, click [ map ] then search for parking in city search.

Hello all,

I know a very decent PHP OO Framework,which I have
used little so far for web application.

It is called PHP Site Manager and it can be accessed
at:

www.roadsend.com/sitemanager

They have excellent documentation..

Message-ID: <OE42X28ZmSych2LjMNv0000c058@hotmail.com>

I am from NY but am currently work in DC.  I have enjoyed the topics brought up in this mailing list but is there a PHP mailing list for DC? How about a DC PHP users group? 

I was hoping to attend a meeting in DC but going to meetup.com php we so far only have 8 members (3 includes me, my co-worker, and my boss).  With DC and the surrounding environs considered a Techtopia [http://www.nvtc.org/techtopia/mapwlogos.pdf]
with a lot of tech companies (vs NY having mostly financials, insurance, etc., which are non-IT centered) I think that the should be a lot of php programmers here [not meaning to knock NYC but I spent months looking for a job before deciding to leave my birthplace and look for a job elsewhere].  Anyone have any info?

Thanks, I'm from NJ so I'm not used to having a search engine for the

For anybody else driving, there's a lot on 24th just east of 3rd.

I am from DC and long to return to NY but work in Baltimore.  I have been
coding in PHP for nearly a year now but for now I code in ASP cuz it pays
the bills.  I haven't found anything in DC for PHP programmers, but if you
know of anything I'd be happy to put my name on the list.

I am from NY but am currently work in DC.  I have enjoyed the topics

about a DC PHP users group? 

I was hoping to attend a meeting in DC but going to meetup.com php we so
far only have 8 members (3 includes me, my co-worker, and my boss).  With
DC and the surrounding environs considered a Techtopia
[http://www.nvtc.org/techtopia/mapwlogos.pdf]
with a lot of tech companies (vs NY having mostly financials, insurance,
etc., which are non-IT centered) I think that the should be a lot of php
programmers here [not meaning to knock NYC but I spent months looking for a
job before deciding to leave my birthplace and look for a job elsewhere]. 
Anyone have any info?

Hello everyone,

I am developing very basic Content Management website and have a working
web-based HTML editor for Windows client.  Since Mac does not support the
IE 5.5 editing features, I need to find a Java based  solution for Mac OS
(8, 9).  I have seen some enterprise level Java applets (EditOnPro,
EditLive - only Mac OS X(), but their licensing is too expensive for me (10
user license per domain minimum) .

Any suggestions or advice  is most appreciated.

Message-ID: <F9E832D44277A64EA6FB98FE9BD720FDAFF75C@psle07.xchg.pwj.com>

Hi all, I've been a lurker for a couple months as I've been learning PHP,
and many of your suggestions have been really helpful.  I was hoping someone
might have an idea on how to tackle an issue I haven't been able to find any
info on.

I'm currently working on a new version of a departmental intranet website.
I have a database, and offer the users a search page that lets them query it
in a variety of ways.  The new results page is not laid out in a grid, as
the old one was (we've added a lot of new fields, and the grid would be too
packed).  Some users have requested the ability to download the data for
import into Excel (they used to just copy and paste the table in).  I've
figured out how to create a .csv file, and I could, theoretically, create
one every time someone runs a query, save it in a temp directory, and
include a link to it on the webpage.  We'd have to run a cleanup routine
every night, though, to delete all these .csv's on the server.  It seems
really clumsy to me.  What I'd like to do is put a link on the result page
that, when clicked on, builds the .csv right then and offers it to the user
for download.  Is this feasible, or should I just go with the temp directory
full of reports?

Thanks in advance,
Tom

Hi, I think this self explaining code helps :

header("Content-disposition: filename=$filename.csv");
header("Content-type: application/octetstream");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Expires: 0");
echo $csvfilecontent;


PS : You need to use this code before any other output since header() function requires to be sent
before anything else.

Hi Tom

nothing wrong in creating on the fly .cvs file if required only.
so you can save bulk of the .csv files.

anyway : two approach you can have

1: you can generate the file and save it to the harddisk  and offer as link.

2: You can either dont save it to disk but just output the content stream to 
the user when clickingon the link... by using
assuming "$contents" is the content that you want to write in a file.

header('Content-Type: application/text');
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='.$FILENAME);
echo $contents ;
exit;


I hope this might be useful.

Thanks everyone!  I was unaware of the Content-disposition header.  I'll
give this a try as soon as I can!

Thanks again,

Hey there,

Another thing I'd add, is how different browsers handle filenames, as in
Kayra's example below.  If, for example, the filename is output.csv, some
will handle it correctly, some will give the name yourscriptname.php, and
worst of all, some versions of MS IE will name it something weird and
random like a3uxe382 (without an extension!)  It'd probably be a good idea
to give explicit instruction to save the resulting output and rename it
with the correct filename/extension.

I suggest using tab delimiting rather than comma delimiting.  They're 
easier to handle.

Also, there's no need to create a temporary file.  Just have your script
display the desired output in the browser.  Folks can save it from there.

The header() stuff folks passed along is handy, too.

Hello,

Well I don't know if you are running on Windows or on Unix server but I if
you are running an a windows platform,  you can change the MIME type on the
results page and have it come up on an excel sheet and if they want to save
it they can just go to file save as and save the results on their computer.

Hope this helps.

One thing that I have done is create an HTML table as usual, no graphics
or anything like that. But at the top of the page before you output
anything to the browser, you can do:

header("Content-Type: application/excel");

If you are on a windows machine and have excel installed and are using
IE, excel will open up and convert the thing to a basic spreadsheet.
Then the user could save this file if they want.

The only problem I've had in the past is the user trying to save the
file on the server when they have the excel open in front of them.

You may want to check that "application/excel" part. I may be wrong.
Could be "...ms-excel" or something. Shouldn't be tough to look up on
the web though.

Hope this is helpful,

hise

Everything's working great.  That's exactly what I was looking for.

I did hit a Microsoft snag, of course, which gave me a good hour and a half
of headaches.  

It turns out that the first two characters of a text file loaded into MS
Excel CANNOT be "ID".  Of course, I was calling my first column "ID".
Excel, upon finding those characters, assumes the file is a SYLK (symbolic
link) file, and tries to read it as such.  This fails, so you get the
cryptic error "SYLK: File format is not valid."  I spent at least an hour
trying to figure out what about my output was invalid (line terminators,
separators, possible bogus characters in the data), until I finally searched
the web in desperation and hit upon a Microsoft KB article acknowledging the
problem.  Just makes you wanna scream, sometimes.

I wouldn't call hitting something like that a Microsoft snag.. Exactly how unlucky are you ? :)

Donald,
   I was one of the presenters Wednesday evening. We're working on 
getting all our slides and a description of our framework online, both 
on nyphp.org and at our own URL.

   I'll make an announcement to this list when that has all been uploaded.

Thank you,
Benjamin Stiglitz

There were some notes taken, however the presentation itself with code
samples, documentation, and referring articles should be put online at
http://dev.nyphp.org/jawa shortly by the presenter.  I will be out of
the country starting tomorrow morning, but I've created an account for
the presenter to put content online and he should make an announcement
when it is available.

Donald Organ --

Your optonline.net site is well down and straightforward -- is it done with
mysql/php?

Are the links on the front page ALL referenced/pulled from a database?

if your user are using excel-2000 you can use the xml speardsheet format.
there is documentation on it somewhere on msdn.microsoft.com , somewhere.
i use http://homepage.tinet.ie/~jmcnamara/perl/WriteExcel.html , perl
module. i beleive it writes in an older format, but i'm sure it will do, i
just like the simple interface. for the xml format i would just create a
file and in the save as, save as xml speardsheet and look at how it looks.
there is also a libxls right now i can't remember the link, its a c
library no documenation but you can look at the sample programs to get an
idea... not that simple.... maybe if your curious.

my defense:
i do it easily in perl becase perl like the php program gets its data from
a c++ generted xml file and both use the same exact parser. why c++ a
lot of things need to get generated on the fly (php to slow for it).

this is what i currently do on my site as far as headers... i'm sure i
didn't even think when i did this, i just probably copied from somewhere:

/* no cache */
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); //always modified
header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");  // HTTP/1.1
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
header("Pragma: no-cache"); // HTTP/1.0

/* application */
header("Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel");
header("Content-Disposition: inline; filename=fund.xls");
header("Content-Description: PHP3 Generated Data" );
header("Content-Length: ".strlen($contents));
print $contents;

ciao i hope this helps.

Hi all,

   A few days ago there was thread re: PHP methodologies.
   I  found  this  while  browsing PHP.builder and thought I'd pass it
   along: http://phpbuilder.com/columns/nair20011003.php3

Actually.. the article's title is a little bit misleading. I don't see any paradigm or methodology discussed there. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the article is bad, but what I see is there a coding standard, which is much more deeply covered in the PHP Coding Standard you can find here http://utvikler.start.no/code/php_coding_standard.html

Obviously, there's no coding style/standard that is going to work for everybody, but I believe it is crucial to adhere to a standard (any standard) when coding in environment where there's more than one programmer working on the same project. The coding guidelines for the Linux kernel, or PHPBB2 are nice examples of this.

I'll have them up tomorrow at some point. And, as promised, we'll have a 
whole lot of information on our website (http://jawa.tanjero.com/) 
starting August 1st. Don't bother visiting beforehand - there won't be

Message-ID: <F85VqWdStTqNxjx4rg50000f532@hotmail.com>

Anyone know of some good free (or very cheap) software for inventory 
management?

I have a potential client who has this problem: their current system handles 
the inventory count OK (decrementing inventory when an order is shipped), 
but it is not very flexible and does not handle other needs.  They also need 
some way to note, for example, that item a is selling at a rate of b units 
per day, that they will be out-of-stock at the current rate in c days, that 
person d has put in an order on date e for f amount of new stock, that the 
new stock is estimated to arrive on date g, and that in-stock item h (maybe 
a different color of the same type of item or some other minor variation) 
should be pushed by sales as an alternative if item a is out-of-stock.

Slightly more complicated than that if the item is seasonal.

The re-order curve has to follow a stocking-delay lag and this may
zero out where expected sales of items (hockey sticks in summer) will
exceed the cost of stocking the item (purchase + storage + taking up
space for more salable items,) so its usually cheaper to have a fire
sale and then move it out to jobbers who take lots of stuff its no
longer cost-effective to hold on to. (Thats' how 99 cent stores get
most of their goods.)

The inventory system has to be modified in the following manner.

Each item in the inventory has to have a link to the state machine
which describes its (re-)order process (supply side) and its
projected consumption (demand side) and some parameters on minimum
(buy trigger) and maximum (stop further buy trigger) quantities on
hand. 

This can all vary over time and monitoring this is   the job of an
inventory manager, above and beyond bossing the inventory, delivery
and shelf stocking crew.

In addition to the GUI and DB maintenance software to maintain this
meta-information (its not the items or the QOH it __about__ the QOH)
the system itself has to have the triggers and the state machines put
into place as well as the software to set up and put down buy orders

I spent years in DP for a major food chain and retail store chain
until the owner decided that she'd rather retire rich and sold off
the family business.

Hi Folks:

Nice meeting some of you last week.  Security Focus' latest weekly 
contains a notice about a JavaScript vulnerability.  In some ways, it's 
just another incantation of prior problems.

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5290

Anyway, it's a good reason to keep JS off in your browser.  And another
good not to rely on it on your websites.

Enjoy,

Damn.

I got this message literally five minutes after I finished a fancy, OO 
JavaScript bar chart builder, assuming everyone who is going to be using the 
site will have JS enabled.  :{

Another business case to do this on the server with PHP, I guess.

Thanks for the heads up.

I think I'm just going to go with plan "A".  There is no mention of a
problem in Linux -- big surprise.


<snip>

The discoverer of this issue has reported that Microsoft does not feel this
is a valid vulnerability. A workaround for Internet Explorer is to disable
the ability of script code to manipulate/interact with the clipboard/cut and
paste functionality.

To do so, users should:

- Click on the "Tools" toolbar pulldown
- Select "Internet options"
- Click on the "Security" tab
- For each of the zones that you wish to disable the feature:
- Click "Custom Level"
- Go to the "Scripting" sub-section
- Set "Allow paste operations via script" to "Disable"

Another, broader workaround is to disable scripting completely. This may
adversely affect your browsing abilities.

Dan, sorry I didn't have the chance to meet you, I showed up a little late &
then had to scoot out as soon as the presentation was through.

Onto the JS vulnerability.  This vulnerability must come from the server.  I
still stick by JS as a valuable addition to the web experience.  If you want
to have JS disabled to protect against hitting an untrusted site then fine,
that doesn't mean I shouldn't use JS in my web apps.  You can always check a
vendor out to find out if they are what you would consider reputable.  If
so, add them to your trusted list & have JS enabled in your trusted list.

Today's business is a lot more savy to the ways of the web and when they see
functionality on a web site that they want on theirs, throwing security up
as an excuse not to do it doesn't work anymore.  When they can find this
functionality on large reputable sites they consider that the security
issues must not be so great and that you are just being the purveyor of doom
and gloom.  I still take the position that if my client wants it and I can
code it, then they will get it.  They will get my standard warning about the
potential insecurity, but the final decision is there's.  If they should
lose business because too many of their potential customers have JS
disabled, then the burden is on them since they decided to forego my
warning.  If they should find themselves under attack, once again, the
burden is on them.

Jim

Subject: Credit Card Validation Solution updated
Message-ID: <20020730004356.GA28270@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

I'm happy to announce the latest versions of my
Credit Card Validation Solution.  This includes a new JSP Edition and
reworking the PHP and Perl Editions into an Object Oriented paradigm. 

If you're using a version prior to the following, please upgrade:
  Ed.   Ver  URI
  ----  ---  ---
  JSP   4.2  http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/ccvs-jsp.htm 
  Perl  4.7  http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/ccvs-pl.htm
  PHP   4.4  http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/ccvs-ph.htm

An older version of it is also available for Visual Basic at
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/ccvs-vb.htm

If you're not familliar with these scripts, here's a quick description:

It ensures credit card numbers are keyed in correctly. Includes checks
that the length is correct, the first four digits are within accepted
ranges, the number passes the Mod 10 Checksum and that you accept the
given type of card. Just to be clear, this process does not check with
banks or credit card companies to see if the card number given is actually
associated with a good account. It just checks to see if the number
matches the expected format.

Enjoy,

--Dan

As a fairly new PHP developer, I'm wrestling with not only learning the
lingo, but also attempting to discover best practice.  When I was first
faced with ASP when ASP was first introduced I made the design snafu of
developing my first small page as a single page.  Login, login validation,
form entry, form validation and submission, and submission response all
rolled up into 1 .asp file.  While it was great for this 1 small app ( more
of an applet ), when the client wanted to add more stuff it required
re-arranging the app splitting it up, figuring out the then flawed
response.redirect etc.  It then required adding to the top of each page the
security checks to ensure the user was logged in etc. ( of course added as
an include ).

Well to make a short story long, I encountered an ASP app written by another
programmer which I was inheriting which used a single entry point(
everything went through default.asp ( ASP's equivalent of index.php ) ).  He
used an encrypted querystring parameter to key the ASP file as to which page
was really required & then using a case statement included the necessary
files.  He must not have been aware of ASP's static include, all includes
are included regardless of control logic around the include.  I did think
the solution to be rather elegant, hiding the implementation from the user
by only exposing 1 page.  Later as I developed it I even moved the encrypted
parameter to a hidden form field to even hide that part of the
implementation.

I've seen a few PHP apps floating around that use a similar design.  In PHP
the obvious advantage over the ASP version is the dynamic include ( include
based on the surounding logic ).  I'm interested to get the opinion of more
experienced PHP developers on this single entry point design.  I realize
this design will not allow search engines to index more than the entry
point, but I'm developing in an extranet environment where search engines
are not desired anyway.

I think one of the things that draws me to this solution is the ease of
security checks and forcing a specific modality ( ie. stopping the browsers
back button & ensuring a specific work flow where required ).

Please let me know your opinion on this.

Jim

I will have to disaggree with your conclusion that this kind of a design will have major advantages regarding security.

You could just seperate you security page (that checks whether the user is signed in and has the required permissions) and include it in every page (maybe along with stuff that you include anyway. .like the <HTML><HEAD>
<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-51353372-3"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'UA-51353372-3');
</script> stuff). 

I've found that what you're describing is good for template based sites. For instance on freelinuxcd.org I use a very simple implementation of this. All pages have the same table structure which keeps the look uniform, but depending on the 'page' variable passed, the appropriate CONTENT is displayed in the table cells. If you would like to take a look at the code it's in http://freelinuxcd.org/download/latest/. There's no authentication there simply because we have no use for it. 

Lastly, you can accomplish most of what you're describing by using a dummy frame that keeps the url unchanged no matter which page you go to.

cheers..

Oktay

Yeah, having one page for everything is tough to manage.  I like
separating pages by purpose.  Though, a purpose may have several steps
that I'll integrate into a given script using switch statements.

As Oktay mentioned, having one page vs many doesn't make a real difference
for securty.  Use an include file that does the login validation at the
top of each file which needs it.

The security advantages I'm refering too have to do with centralizing the
security & modality checks.  By the checks being in 1 place, there's no
danger in adding a page to the system and forgetting to put the necessary
includes.  It seems to be a simpiler and less error prone design.  You may
disagree, but can you see where this design would be a bad thing?

I hadn't thought of the dummy frame for implementation hiding, I'll have to
give that some thought.  Although the implementation hiding in the single
entry point is more complete if you utilize simple encryption on the
variable that controls the "next page".  For instance, the design I'm
working with creates a sequence# + the next page encrypted with a system
key.  This means that all intersite links are giberish to someone looking at
page source.  It also means I can ensure the back button on the browser was
not hit, or the browsers history not used since these requests will have an
out of order sequence#.  It also makes it nearly impossible for a hacker to
submit a form that will be accepted from the server since the sequence# is
different every time that page is hit since it is based on 1) the initial
sequence# assigned to the session ( it's not 1 or 0, but a random range )
and 2) on the order the user chooses the pages.  A hacker may break past the
login security ( or be a valid user ) and navigate to the page they want to
hack & then attempt to circumvent the system since the source contains valid
encrypted links, but this makes hacking all the more trouble.  Add on top of
that usage log analysis showing the same user going though the same sequence
followed by errors raises flags you may have an attempted hack.  All the
while this implementation is hidden making the hack alot harder.  Not to say
a similar system could not be designed along side the normal links hidden
via the dummy frame, it just seems like it would be more work.

For instance on freelinuxcd.org I use a very simple implementation of this.
All pages have the same table structure which keeps the look uniform, but
depending on the 'page' variable passed, the appropriate CONTENT is
displayed in the table cells. If you would like to take a look at the code
it's in http://freelinuxcd.org/download/latest/. There's no authentication
there simply because we have no use for it.

With single entry point, and PHP's dynamic include, I can seperate pages by
purpose, but all going through the single entry point.  PHP also allows for
a variable in an include which eliminates the need for a switch statement
like
is required in ASP.

Please see my response to Oktay.

Jim,

Sounds like you might like to try Fusebox.  (I haven't used it yet.)  My notes 
are that Fusebox is a tool that facilitates an 
all-functionality-through-index.php approach.

http://nyphp.org/list/viewmesg.html?mid=81:  "The example's containing index.php 
are most likely mimicking 'fusebox' methodology, which is a great way to 
organize files, especially if you are coding as part of a team or on a large 
application.  Its mainly been popular on ColdFusion applications but fairly 
recently has been extended to PHP. Their are some nice code shortcuts and 
re-usability advantages by going this route.  Check out http://bombusbee.com/ 
for more info.  regards, ken schwartz".  5/~1/02

Eg, article http://bombusbee.com/index.php?fuseaction=articles.view&id=6

More info that was kindly provided me:

That's the LAMP way!

Probably one of the main reasons MS still has a large advantage in the
server market is because of the 'elite' attitude of many Linux types.

If you don't see it how I see it, your obviously wrong and a retard and
don't deserve a computer! Lol

I, and the DoJ, would disagree.  Apparantly, so would Netcraft :)

I haven't seen this attitude from as many people as I've heard it
speculated upon by outsiders.  I will say the average free/open 
software advocate is infinitely more pleasant than the average ISP or 
Telco rep.

It's really not fair to judge the entire group based on one alleged
overreaction.  Maybe the guy's puppy was just run over, maybe the email
he received was rude, maybe it was misinterpreted...we don't know.
However, persons are persons, and I've seen every org from Dell to
BlackBerry to Microsoft to OpenBSD have some truly obnoxious
individuals firing off unnecessarily.

So, let's judge people individually, and not by the mass stereotype.  
Unless they use M4, in which case they're just creepy and sinister.

I was judging based on a report that was given in regarding the PHP
webmasters telling someone they should learn to read and other such
insults because someone was having trouble navigating their GUI.
I can very easily see a upper level tech deciding to try out a php
implementation of a project at say Morgan Stanley, or another big firm
and having some trouble on the website.  This person emails php.net and
gets berated... Now this person who may have converted is now just
pissed off and will probably solve his problem with another means.  Be
it that he uses PHP still, or just tells his boss that it's not worth
working with PHP because the support is so bad...

It's just not professional to have this attitude, especially if you are
an underdog.  In business, image comes way before quality... sadly
enough.  I know this point can be argued, but marketing works. Well.

Can we all stop crying for a few moments to recognize how much time the
people that work on the site and documentation take out of their lives
for no money?  If you have a problem with it then join the team and help
them, otherwise stop bitching.  As for the bug system... the open-srm
crew was working on Bubar, a new bug system, for php.net.  I worked on
it a bit with them, but time constraints didn't allow much of my time.
Last I heard Derrick and Jani had put the application on hold, until
time there was more time available.

The email you sent me off-list, where you called me "an evil moron who
can't read" deeply hurt my feelings.  Everyone, take this as an official
report that Adam's employer is not someone with whom you should do
business.

Of course, I'm being facetious, but the point is made.  Someone says
"they were rude" and the rumors begin.  Assuming the report is even
true, maybe the guilty party at PHP was repremanded for it.  PHP has 
done a lot for us, we can at least give them some benefit of the doubt.

This is a totally unfair assumption.  You're rumouring anyone who 
emails php.net gets insulted, once again with no proof or evidence.  My
point in the original email was simply to be fair and not make
judgements about how an entire organization behaves based on one
speculatory email.

Your response is to speculate that if upper management at Morgan Stanley
has problems, PHP.net will automatically flip them the bird.

That's not fair.  As Oktay (I think) said, if we can all see the email 
exchange, we'll decide for ourselves.  Until then, it's borderline 
slanderous to continue like this, and without merit.


In closing: If you are fair, judge based on facts and don't 
  perpetuate stereotypes and rumors, we'll all be happier.
  I'm not denying they could definitely be completely rude, but
  we don't have any reason to think they usually are.

yes, if the attitudes smelled like team spirit i'd probably be more tempted.

If any of you have a problem with the creators or contributors to PHP,
then don't use the language.  I know several of them, and I'm sure they
won't mind.  It's like you people are biting the hand that feeds you.
You're ungrateful and shouldn't be using open source if you don't
appreciate it.

Yes I see your point.  

However, the original communication from PHP made someone feel slighted.
Regardless of the content of the message from PHP, it made that person
feel bad for having contacted asking for assistance because his question
or comment was unwelcome to the recipient (php.net).  It's just not
professional, nor does it help the open source cause to shut people out
like this.  That's all.  Think before you hit send.  If your stressed,
go take a walk and remember what the outdoors looks like perhaps.  I
don't know, but don't take it out on potential clients.  That's just bad
business.

I did not rumor that anyone who emails php will get this type of
response.  But someone did get a response like this, and one time is
more than enough.  Chances are that was not the only degrading email
that left their mail servers.  (I'm assuming the message was degrading
as I trust the people on this list, and unless he has a personal
vendetta against php, he was made to feel shitty from a reply from
php.net... no reason to make this stuff up.)

I'm not saying PHP.NET is evil, just that this attitude is.  Go read a
bunch of OS based responses on /. And you will cringe and be embarrassed
to admit you run linux.  Almost good reason to switch to BSD! Lol.

The email you sent me off-list, where you called me "an evil moron who
can't read" deeply hurt my feelings.  Everyone, take this as an official
report that Adam's employer is not someone with whom you should do
business.

Of course, I'm being facetious, but the point is made.  Someone says
"they were rude" and the rumors begin.  Assuming the report is even
true, maybe the guilty party at PHP was repremanded for it.  PHP has 
done a lot for us, we can at least give them some benefit of the doubt.

What does this have to do with appreciating open source ? Although I will not speculate whether some person received some degrading email from a php.net webmaster (by the way I still do not see any email. for all I care there's no email), I don't see this as biting the hand that feeds you. PHP.net people are human beings just like you and me and their actions and attitudes can be discussed just like any body else's.

Hypothetically speaking.. had there been an email of the said type, the person receiving the email would be very much entitled to be pissed. This has nothing to do with one's appreciation of or commitment to open source software or the community. 
 
And what kind of ignorence is it to suggest not using the language if you don't like the creators or contributors of PHP? If things worked that way nobody would be using qmail or even openssh. 

You mention you know several of the PHP developers and that they wouldn't mind if somebody chooses not to use PHP over the impoliteness of a php.net webmaster. I would very much like to think otherwise. If there are no users, there is no community. Without the community there will be no PHP (or any other community dependend software or concept for that matter).

Every one I've talked to that is anyone major with PHP or Zend has seemed
decent and helpful as long as I didn't ask stupid questions. They seem to
follow the rule that every other large project follows.. ask the right
person the right question. High level people get bombed with tons of
questions, suggestions, dumb ideas, good ideas, etc and tend to get tired.
Sometimes they will respond in ways that aren't really nice (and sometimes
they apologize especially if you prove not to be an idiot) but you just
have to remember that they are frequently exhausted and grumpy from
spending so much time doing what you really want them to be doing anyway.
Coding, writing docs, etc. ;) Try asking someone further down the chain.
If it needs to come to the attention of someone higher you'll typically be
directed to the right person. Works that way in almost any large project.


Don't dream it. Be it.

I'll step out on a limb and disagree with the others that responded to
your message. I've written some very large PHP-based sites and from my
experiences I've learned to base any sites of any size off a moduler
single entry point design. For an example of the framework I created for
my own use try http://freshmeat.net/projects/kfl/ and see my newest
version.

I do not suggest that using a single entry point design is reasonable for
every project. Small sites don't really benefit from the more structured
design. Also a single entry point site can be designed totally without
enternal structure which is just a mess. It can also be beneficial to have
several 'single entry points' to group modules as is practical for your
problem domain.

As someone else said templates are a good design choice for use with
single entry points. IMO so are object oriented modules. Good object
oriented design will make it easier to maintain security and
maintainability as the site growsbut by no means will do your job for you.

There is no reason why search engines won't or can't spider as deep as you
want even with a single entry point. It's a pretty easy trick to pass PHP
arguments in the URL path. For example index.php?module=logon can be done
as index.php/module/logon or just index.php/logon if you wanted.. hiding
the fact that the requested files are dynamic from the search engines.

As one of the disaggreing people :), I'd like to mention again that there's no automatic security advantage to designing a site with a single entry point that I can think of.

I'd say it's more of a design issue. The fewer possible places to leave
something out the fewer places you have to audit before you're sure
security is working. I've worked on sites that had been written over a
couple years time by dozens of programmers with dozens of modules and
nothing ever documented and so forth. Security was a nightmare to ensure.
By putting it all under the same tent to begin with then at least you can
ensure that security is working unless someone specificly disabled it.

This is quite right and accurate im my experience. Building objects
has, in my experience, been even more helpful than a single entry point.

All are right at their point if view..

Bcoz security depneds upon type of application, Session management 
capapbility of script and coding.
u may include as many as files as u need due to php's powerful inclusion 
facility.

And can place your security checking in those special files or session which 
doesn't contain any html tags
hence user or hackers can't track it.

But as told above it depends upon application type and coding, we can 
atleast sepearte main security checing and
data displying in forms.

Hence single entry is not that much useful in all type of application..

Jim is quite right about his point.."using single entry suytem in all 
projects."

Thanks

I definitely agree. This is what we tried to achieve here at Tanjero 
with Jawa. The beauty of using objects in the concept of inheritance. 
Normal page functionality is inherited from base classes. As long as the 
public interface doesn't change, it doesn't matter how we implement any 
one feature; if we want our pages to be output in WML instead of HTML, 
we only have to change it in one place. Authenticated pages are a just a 
subclass, etc...

Of course, objects aren't very useful without planning. The first thing 
we did was create a class map, which has now become a terrifying graph 
of objects will all sorts of lines connecting objects. Easy it wasn't; 
however, it's paid off quite a bit.

Thank you,

A real selling point for me for using object oriented design for a website
is the ability to easily embed one pages functionality inside of another.
For example you can have a login page and include it as a login box in
other pages without recoding much of anything. The data all goes through
the same checks, is handled in exactly the sameway, etc. It seems a small
thing but as you get into complicated modules it can be a major benefit.
You can achieve some major code resue even between multiple sites.


Don't dream it. Be it.
