Subject: appropriate rates
Message-ID: <000c01c1f6e3$d8f10dd0$644ca818@kenschwartz>

I know this question is hard to answer due to the many factors that could be involved.   But I'm just looking for very general input.  I'm wondering if anyone can give me ballpark idea of appropriate rates/project price for a fairly 'normal' upgrade from a static HTML site to one with some PHP enabled dynamic components.  By 'normal' I mean nothing crazy in the data model or code expected.  I need to give a client a project price and I've been working completely inside a corporate environment for the past 3 years so I really don't know what the freelance market will bear.  Anyone wish to enlighten me?

Thanks and best regards,
Kenneth Schwartz

If no database work is involved then I would charge $50.00

Hello all,

I've just sent out a mailing giving some details about the new mailing
list system and site, both of which should be working now.  Please
email me offlist if you've gotten this mailing, so I know it went out
OK.

Also feel free to email me offlist for any problems you may have with
the new software.  And, note that ftp://nyphp.org readonly/dev is
available to look at the code (although it may not be at the moment). 
However, please keep any discussion about the software on the list.

Thank you,

Hans Z.

hi,

It's a pretty tricky market right now in New York City. I think the 
going rate is about $45/hr with or without DB work. I  know some amazing 
programmers who now basically will take anything, they have been out of 
work for months. I heard that AMEX axed 2000 programmers, sent the whole 
operation to India just the other day. So the competition is going to be 
fierce here.  

A real eye opener is to check out  how rock bottom the prices 
programmers are charging on elance.com.  What's scary is that these 
overseas guys are doing some great coding, and charging almost nothing. 
I lived in India for a few weeks, my hotel was 70 cents a day. So a 
$1000 for a full featured Web site is a nice piece of change if you are 
outside the USA for sure. Not everyone can send their work [and deal 
with the logistics] overseas, so building  up relationships now may pay 
off with bigger projects later.

Good luck... ed

Somewhere in this neat package lies some sort of idtag parser for mp3s. I remember finding a smaller piece of code in that past, I'm sure you can find it too if you search freshmeat and google.

Unless there's a clever way of doing it, I'd imagine you'd have to know
the internal structure of MP3 files.  Then, step through the bytes to
read what info you need, in this case the bitrate.  A quick google for
the "MP3 specification" produced:

http://www.id3.org/mp3frame.html

I've recently seen a similar set of code.  Although it deals with tar
files, the principles will be the same; that of walking through binary
files.  I've the attached the file (plus I want to test the system
out!).

i'm kinda blown away by answers.google.com, you may post there, offer $5 
bucks, and get the code back in a few hours...  I think it's the hottest 
thing on the web in months....  for sure an interesting business model.

Hi,

I'm stuck on something.

I was planning on sending sensitive data to an https server from a script. I
was going to use libcurl, but I found out that their ISP's version of
libcurl was not compiled with ssl support and hence does not support https
posts. I also cannot issue the exec() command.

Is there any other way to post data to a URL via ssl from a php script?

I joined the NYPHP mailing list in part because I am seriously considering
moving to New York City in the next few months, although I have to ask,
considering $50.00 an hour seems to be a high rate there... how can one
afford to live in New York, and only get $50 an hour contracting? I am
currently in Phoenix, and it is hard to get by now.  I would have thought
with the high cost of living one would make more. Is it just me or does it
seem a little strange?

It's simply supply and demand..

There are simply too many skilled programmers looking for projects like these and the number of projects are not too many. I would be surprised if you could get $50/hr since a lot of people are willing to work for less (after having looked for a job for months).

I don't think there is any clear-cut answer - you could get lucky and
find a fantastic job.  However, the average situation appears to be
high supply of programmers and low demand for them, which will drive
down rates.  That said, it's important to consider the future.  In my
opinion, the economy as a whole will start to pick up again by fall,
meaning more demand for skills, and when that happens, it'd be a lot
better having your name out there (in the form of resumes,
applications, small projects already completed, etc) than trying to
jump in after the fact.  Of course, it's easier said than done.

spend a lot of time with your boxes.....<g>
competition here, esp in your field is fierce right now. 
You'd probably get a higher rate repairing legacy Netware

Personally, I'd go the route of a fixed price for a WELL defined site
upgrade, and then $X an hour for changes / upgrades.

It it's more than 1 (or 2) hours work to create a specficiation document,
charge something small just for that. (so they won't get your document
with the nescasasy changes and then get a cheaper bid elsewhere and leave
you with nothing).

In this day and age, most places need to control costs, so a fixed price
can give them some peace of mind. Also - it's easier to give a "discount"
on a fixed price for the WHOLE project.

Also - see if you can get from them what their budget is and try to work
something out accordingly.

If you do go with fixed price, make sure to include a clause where they'll
pay you for hours worked if for some reason they want to break the contract.

Ultimiately, you need to figure out how much it's worth it to you to
get this project.

hope that helps.

Hi Alan,

I hate to be discouraging, but to be frank, the "web development" job
openings scene in NYC is currently very poor.

There are still some positions which are still in demand like if you're
a senior Java person with strong financial background, but if you're
just a "web/internet" developer, you're up against a big crowd.

In any case, good luck.

Check out this article:

http://www.nydailynews.com/2002-02-17/News_and_Views/City_Beat/a-141677.asp

Read this in the paper 2 wks. after moving here on Feb 1.  I'm still working
my corporate job (from home, the company is in Chicago) so I don't need to
survive on freelance right now, but I think this article is not accurate at
all.  Everyone seems to be struggling and IT is no exception in NY.  I've
floated my resume out there because I'm not particularly fond of working at
home, and I'm not getting as much response as expected.  Just so you have an
accurate idea before moving out here.  Its tough all over, and I this
article is way off in citing huge programming demand in NY.

Message-ID: <E1858F33EF60D411AC120008C74C668A3D33BA@EXCHANGE>

I agree Ophir's sentiment.  I do a lot of freelance myself, run my own
company that produces a product where I also hire a lot of freelancers
to do php work, vb client side windows and Delphi work.  (If any of you
are Delphi wizards, please email me!)

When I hirer a programmer I ask them for a project price, and I normally
neg. a certain amount of hours after completion for bug testing and
minor revisions.. all in the base cost.  Then anything new and major I
do at fixed cost again.  
I have one programmer now that I have on a maintenance contract for the
lifecycle of this version, which is until September.  He wrote the
software, and now is on call for any quick changes etc.  This is a
win/win situation.  I know it costs me $X/month to have the piece of
mind my software will be supported no matter what.  He has the piece of
mind knowing he can pay his rent, go on vacation, or whatever. :)

On the other side, when I take a freelance gig, it is normally for
graphic design and implementation of the backend. (I have a friend I
work with) And I always make up a contract with each module depicted and
how long it will take approx. and then give a project price, and payment
terms. Usually 25%, 50% at a milestone, and 25% on completion.  I also
host all my clients work, and charge for hosting, and a maintenance
contract for bug fixes, server maintainence etc.  Once I started doing
the hosting, I started keeping clients, and making more $ as you are
much more intimately involved in their business.

As Ophir said it is _very_ important that your client understands that
additional work is not included in the project price.  Scope creep is a
horrible thing for a programmer.  If scope creep isn't talked about,
your client will assume he can make a change here or there and its OK,
nor realizing how much effort it takes to alter an existing system on a
whim.   And what will wind up happening is you getting shafted, and thus
hurting the entire freelance market because if enough people do this, it
will become the norm... As that's why hourly rates are so low these
days.

Just keep in mind, the contractor wants to get the lowest price and will
cry poor at every conveinance.  It is up to you to stick to your guns
and realize that if he really wants the work done, he will give you what
you deserve.  A line that always works well with me is "You get what you
pay for" ... And then give a small discount, or include an extra service
at the same cost.  (For me, I will give the first month of hosting or
something)

Sorry for the rant, I have just been seeing way to much greed among
contractors f'in over freelancers because the freelancers wont stick up
for themselves.  Is a bad situation.  Contracts and Confidence are good.
If anyone wants some help with one let me know, I'd be happy to look it
over or comment. I'm no lawyer, but I have put together hundreds of jobs
over the past bunch of years.

Having been one of the lucky ones to have found a job in the last 4 months 
after looking for 3 months in NYC and unemployed for 6 months, I have to say 
that moving to NYC last Dec. would have been a very bad decision if it hadn't 
been for living with parents rent-free.  Even now though, I'm earning less, 
working harder than I was before.

I'm a little less optimistic about the economy turning around by fall.  IBM 
is about to lay off 10% of its workforce.

It's important to consider the factors.

3 strikes against NYC.

Spring 2001 - Internet bubble bursts, Investment in Internet companies that 
hire Web Application developers drops to the floor.

Spring 2001 - Companies switch from a "we value a company based on how it can 
grow" to "we value a company based on how much profit it makes."

Fall 2001 - Terrorist attacks depress a struggling economy.  NYC hit-hardest!

All in all, it's not only the economy that's depressed, it's the general 
outlook that most Americans have.  There is still fear here in NYC, you don't 
see it on the street, and you don't talk about it, but it's definitely here.  
The Empire State building is seeing _A LOT_ of vacancies.

I personally, don't see the web developer community going back to salaries 
like we saw in 1999 and 2000 ever.  People with deep technical skills in 
Databases and Application development will make a come back.  Good designers 
will be OK.  But, people who just know how to code HTML and use Dreamweaver 
are a dime a dozen now.

What is happening now is that the Internet business is being incorporated 
into regular business.  Internet Design firms are merging, being bought by 
Established Design firms.  Internet Advertising firms are merging, being 
bought by Established Advertising firms. ... and so on....
the reason it's interesting to be in the PHP community, in my opinion, is 
that since the tools are free, costs a low, and while Internet budgets are 
being cut when the tools are free, more money can be set aside for salaries.  
I think smaller companies are staying lean with PHP.

I think this is the crucial point. The explosion in need for "web
programmers" caused a lot of people to go into the field without a lot of
the industrial base of skills that are useful (necessary?) when jobs aren't
so plentiful, like now.

The worst I saw this was at my old company in Boston, after an interview
with a potential programmer. He did the standard 1 or 2 programming
questions we asked and we talked about various things. At the end, he asked
me if we always ask programming questions in interviews. (Yes). He said he
thought that was very tough of us, since this was the first programming
interview he'd been to where he'd actually been asked to write code!

My friend interviews people in DC for his company.  
He had a woman come in for a programming position, but more doing
advanced JS and a little CF.  He asked her to write a simple JS function
to count 1 to 10 and display the results on the browser.  She started to
cry and say that she thought it was very unfair that they ask this hard
of a question on an interview... As she was stressed out enough.

Tho that doesn't beat the ex biker transvestite turned web developer who
barely knew what a <title> tag was trying to ask for a 60k salary at my
company. :)

It doesn't help on Stern every morning you hear ads to become an IT
professional and make the big bucks... Advertising to bottom of the
barrel folks.  Oh well.

I think in the consulting world, its all about word of mouth these days.
If I put an ad in the paper I will be flooded with so much garbage it is

I think this is the crucial point. The explosion in need for "web
programmers" caused a lot of people to go into the field without a lot
of
the industrial base of skills that are useful (necessary?) when jobs
aren't
so plentiful, like now.

The worst I saw this was at my old company in Boston, after an interview
with a potential programmer. He did the standard 1 or 2 programming
questions we asked and we talked about various things. At the end, he
asked
me if we always ask programming questions in interviews. (Yes). He said
he
thought that was very tough of us, since this was the first programming
interview he'd been to where he'd actually been asked to write code!

Here is my take on things:

Over time and the past 2-3 years, expert developers have made things WAY too
easy ... and in fact myself and others working on AI (on the side because NO
ONE puts any real money into AI) are building
bots/agents/whateveryouwanttocallthem to actually code for themselves
(simple Javascript routines, maybe eventually some PHP since its a bit
easier) but I find the "install and run" attitude to completely forget about
HTML programmers, and the whole evolution of
HTML->XHTML->XML->SOAP->WSDL->UDDI is a bit stalled because no one has R&D
money to blow on things that may or may not work and honestly half the time
of a developer is spent sitting around playing and waiting for a 1.0 API to
be released from some consortium somewhere ...

Then there are other things like VoiceXML which is promised to be so easy to
code even HTML people can do it and then when you learn what you need to
front the bill for such a service its not really like designing for the web
@ all ... cool stuff ... but will take a long time to catch on ...

Im currently riding out unemployement hoping somewhere that there will be a
glimmer of hope that money will be put into AI or some aspect of it but my
outlook is very bad, and even if I was to start something the first
objective of my business plan is to not land the company on
fuckedcompany.com (which is sad) ...

Im stumped on any advise Id give anyone looking to come into NYC expecting
to be a high paid web developer, in fact whats ever worse is if you look on
craigslist for job postings almost everything "free"lance falls under the
$200 mark for a complete web application ... quotes Ive been giving @ even
$35 per hour get turned down and proposals end up in outer space somewhere
...

You don't.. Well at least.  Can do a JS push/receive from the server
every X times or something... Similar to the way PHPLive does it.

If you load up the caht module on Kiwibox.com (teen site) my friend just
finished making that.. uses java. Is nice.

Yeah, 

the job market eventually won't be too bad if you are a GenX-er
(weren't born before 1970.) If you were alive when Woodstock happened
you're are [expletive deleted].

I'm a late Boomer (1953,) and it sems that I truly am [expletive
deleted].

Now all these jobs require a bachelors or a masters and there were
none of these, certainly not in Montreal, when I was going to school
in the late sixties and early seventies. They didn't exist. <sigh>

All you had to know then was your "Math 'N Fizzicks." Amusing because
I NEVER got to use any damn math and certainly no physics through out
my entire career. But I did find my philosophy and architecture
studies very useful. Sadly, I never got a degree.

I have over twenty-five years of experience in AI, object-oriented
software development, have been doing HTML since 1995, did VRML in
1998, have most of my carrer in the financial sector but my resume
won't get past the little eighteen year old who is reading my two
pager and if s/he doesn't find the words "Masters Degree", just
tosses my resume into the "circular file." 

I've been unemployed since September. Had to move from Battery Park
City to Jersey City where my savings aren't disappearing on rent as
fast as in Manhattan. Personally, I'm screwed and I know it. I may
NEVER find a job again. 'Xcept maybe at McDonald's. I am not deluding
myself about my job prospects. Being bright has nothing to do with
getting and holding a job and has nothing to do with survival.

Between you and me. The entire profession is utter bullshit. These
people are blind to something so fundamental that they really should
NOT be blind to but it doesn't seem to be on any curriculum that I've
seen. I have rants about this on my old wiki. 

I wouldn't trust an outdoor toilet built according to MIS stangards
not to collapse on me as I try to take a crap or that anyone had
though of digging a hole under it. (That's doesn't show up on any
"use case".)

I'm glad to have found the NY PupUG because that led me to the
"OpenBiblio" open source php project and I started in public library
systems in 1975, before I actually got my first job in Data
Processing (DP) which is what it was called then, before it got
high-falutin' and called itself "Informatics" and then called itself
Management Information Systems (MIS) and lately it calls itself
Information Technology (IT.)

I'm starting a "Community Wiki Project" (at http://wage.packet.org )
in Jersey City drumming up interest collaborative writing with some
creative people here (at "AlliterationAlley" and "Ground Coffee
House",) and making an end-run around the MIS world. Screw 'em all.
I'll just put 'em all out of business before I'm done. :-)

Actually, I'm seeing possibilities in php that dwarf Smalltalk's.
Deployment of Smalltalk is anecdotal. Only several thousand machines.
While deployment of php is total over Linux platforms and over most
Unix platforms as well. It's even available on IIS though I look for
M$ to try to stop it out for .NET ASAP. That means that if you do
something in php it can be deployed over the entire web or on
intranets.

With a properly constructed Object model (objects, methods and
relationships, not ignoring that objects exist in time as well and
need state information and relationships to state machines to transit
object instances from state to state.) described in XML and
inter-piled (interpreted with the resulting objects cached on the
server and using standard cache invalidation techniques for refresh
only when required,) for use within a wiki.

But for the most part I should be able to implement a trio of phpwiki
plugins.

1) to scan & validate/load the object model, 
2) to load objects as XML from the wiki database and  and 
3) to provide almost all of the functionality I have ever been
required to implement in DP/MIS/IT. Present instances and
relationships for instantiation/observation, modification and
storage. Present functionality for execution.

and which would use the wiki for security, for invocation of
function, for presentation of objects and/or navigation of
relationships, for capture, validation and connection of objects and
relationships and for storage of objects and relationship
connections, in the wiki database in XML. 

The access model can be as permissive (assume yes) or as restrictive
(assume no) as it needs to be. I want the plugin to let
visitors/users:
access meta information:
 N) Navigate the model
access information:
 C) Create/connect objects/relationship connections (contexts)
 R) Read/navigate objects/relationship connections
 U) Update object instances/relationship connections (validation)
 D) Delete object instances & dependent objects)/disconnect (contexts)
 E) Execute functionality

Thereby rendering everything I've ever done and everybody I'd ever
worked with entirely redundant. Now, THAT's a "puissant" idea. That's
also called "gettin' even." 

I'm going to put the code out there in open source as part of
OpenBiblio and it will outlive me as I starve to death in my
cardboard box over a heating grate. (Melodramatic. I hope, so but a
very real prospect nonetheless.)

JS as in Java servlets or Javascript? I lean toward the former, I can't
imagine Javascript having that kind of capability!

Augh! Can't figure this out! There goes my usefulness down the toilet.  Lump

Hello, 

someone was looking for a php based chatroom? Take a look at:

That should start you off.

Javascript... you have a function run every X time to pull data from
your server and document.write it out in a layer you clear or something.

But for an actual IRC type chat environment java is the way to go... But
theres lots of projects already out there for this sortah thing.. And
some commercial ones that are quite nice.  I used www.webmaster.com's
product for our chats.  Just smooth and nice.

JS as in Java servlets or Javascript? I lean toward the former, I can't
imagine Javascript having that kind of capability!

Augh! Can't figure this out! There goes my usefulness down the toilet.

Subject: XMLRPC and Linig for your birdcage
Message-ID: <20020510201343.67089.qmail@web12805.mail.yahoo.com>


This post is basically meaningless, but I wanted to show off my amazing
Visio skills :->.  I've attached a .jpg that shows the basic structure
of NYPHP.org's backend, including list and authentication.

Right now, the site is "hosted" on two servers.  The .html is served
from nyphp.org, but the core code resides on a remote server.  There's
not much sense in this at this point, however, I'm curious as to
anyone's expierence with XMLRPC in PHP - solid, reliable implementation
yet?

Currently, the Parasite Host acts, very minimally, as a web service,
providing an authentication/app framework to what could be any number
of Parasites.  I'm using a homegrown RPC structure now, however would
like to move to XMLRPC for standardization reasons.

The diagram is poor, the organization is weak and the cliches are
cheesy, but if you print it out and put it on the bottom of a birdcage,
it might keep a parrot busy for a few minutes.

I have given up the idea that I will ever get this applet-servlet problem solved, so therefore I am looking toward a simpler solution, namely, a PHP-based chatroom based on this premise:

An HTML frame with a frameset consisting of a continuously renewing PHP script that will pull a flat file of messages and refresh itself with it.  The other frameset would be a form for the user to fill out.

Is that a feasible idea or am I lost in space?

Hi Hans.

cute but you saved the file as an untyped application/octet stream or
something.

I had to save it to disk in order to open it. I know I should have
just been able to open it as a JPG.

This isn't exactly XMLRPC, but the SOAP classes in PEAR are pretty easy to
use, both for clients and servers. THe object model seems well thought out
and it's pretty simple to get up and running.

Actually, when pulling the blob out of MySQL, I send a generic
application/octet-strea content-type to the browser because I don't
save the MIME type with the file.

That's a good addition for the next version though,

I've considered SOAP as well, and although I'm not set in my ways yet,
XMLRPC seems a little less bloated.  However, that bloat may be worth
it depending on the XMLRPC implementation.  Also something I need to
consider will be encryption (ssh through either one of these is
probably a wet dream, no? - I would like to avoid SSL)

I guess bloat is relative, but I don't think you're going to notice it until
you start doing a lot of simultaneous transactions.

As for encryption, if you want to avoid SSL (to not buy certificates?) you
can set up port forwarding with ssh between a port on the client machine and
the port the web server is listening on on the server.

I guess my thinking here will be the ability to provide a drop-in
solution, making implementation as easy as possible for the end-user. 
So, for example, someone has their own site that they want to add user
auth. to.  Ideally, they can subscribe to a free service, download a
PHP library file (or a PHP extension at some point), make a single
tweak to Apache for the site they want to protect, and they have user
auth., tracking, etc.  I guess XMLRPC caught my eye because of it's
directness.  Maybe an application implemented encryption scheme would
be easiest at first.

Message-ID: <007801c1f87c$ed71dce0$e9c0a818@scandinawa1bo6>

I don't know how categorize this one so I'll just shout out a plea for HELP!!!!!!!!

I have the following .php file, menubar_functions.php, resting in the docroot:

<?

 // This function is the PHP version of the TCL proc PRODUCE_MENUBAR which 
 // will produce the menubar for all PHP files
 //
 // Syntax: echo PRODUCE_MENUBAR() 
 //


 function PRODUCE_MENUBAR() {
  global $HTTP_HOST;
  $tcl = (preg_match("/\\bdyndns\\b/i", $HTTP_HOST)) ? "tclsh83" : "tclsh";
  $path = (preg_match("/\\bdyndns\\b/i", $HTTP_HOST)) ? "cgi-bin" : "cgi-bin/cgiwrap/ppowell";
  $fileID = fopen("http://$HTTP_HOST/$path/menubar.cgi", "r");
  $menubar = fread($fileID, 1000000);
  fclose($fileID);
  return $menubar;
 }

?>

I have a file called chat_login.php that is resting in $DOCUMENT_ROOT/chat folder.

I can't call menubar_function.php 's function PRODUCE_MENUBAR (Fatal error) from my file chat_login.php.

What on earth do I do??!?!

The example still doesn't work for me, though, here is the error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function: produce_menubar() in
/users/ppowell/web/chat/chat_login.php on line 55

Here is the code of menubar_functions.php:

<?

 // This function is the PHP version of the TCL proc PRODUCE_MENUBAR which
 // will produce the menubar for all PHP files
 //
 // Syntax: echo PRODUCE_MENUBAR()

 function PRODUCE_MENUBAR() {

  $path = (preg_match("/\\bdyndns\\b/i", $HTTP_HOST)) ? "cgi-bin" :
"cgi-bin/cgiwrap/ppowell";
  $fileID = fopen("http://$HTTP_HOST/$path/menubar.cgi", "r");
  $menubar = fread($fileID, 1000000);
  fclose($fileID);
  return $menubar;
 }

?>

and the offending code in /chat/chat_login.php:

<?
  flush();
  $menubarPath = "http://" . $HTTP_HOST . "/menubar_functions.php";
  require_once($menubarPath);
  flush();
  echo PRODUCE_MENUBAR();

?>

I can't alter php.ini as this is occurring on a remote site (not on my own

Maybe try removing the second call to flush() from chat_login.php

Subject: PHP can't access files (but TCL can!!!)

Message-ID: <017001c1f936$26f49d40$e9c0a818@scandinawa1bo6>

TCL 1, PHP 0

Ok, I am frustrated.. here is my code and this portion has to be done in
PHP.  I have a frame that can only be accessed if 1 of 2 things occur:

1) if $HTTP_REFERER has a specific value
2) if your nickname passed in the query string is found in the existing
nicknames.txt file found in /chat/nicknames.txt

Here is the code:

<?
 // Security measure to prevent bookmarking of page unless nickname exists
in nicknames.txt
 $contents = "";
 if (!preg_match("/\\bchat_process_nickname\\b/i", $HTTP_REFERER)) {
  $canAccessChatroom = 1;
  if (strlen($nickname) < 2) $canAccessChatroom = 0;
  if (!file_exists($DOCUMENT_ROOT . "/chat/nicknames.txt"))
$canAccessChatroom = 0;
  if ($canAccessChatroom == 1) {
   $fileID = fopen($DOCUMENT_ROOT. "/chat/nicknames.txt", r) or die ("could
not open file");
   if (!$fileID) {
    $canAccessChatroom = 0;
   } else {
    $contents = fread($fileID);
    fclose($fileID);
   }
  }
  if ($canAccessChatroom == 1 && strlen($contents) == 0) $canAccessChatroom
= 0;
  if ($canAccessChatroom == 1 && !preg_match("/[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]+/",
$contents)) $canAccessChatroom == 0;
  if ($canAccessChatroom == 1) {
   if (!preg_match("/\\b$nickname\\b/i", $contents)) $canAccessChatroom == 0;
  }
  if ($canAccessChatroom == 0) {
   echo "<meta http-equiv=Refresh content='1;URL=http://" . $SERVER_NAME .
"/chat/chat_login.php'>\
";
   echo "<script>\
<!--\
  location.href='http://" . $SERVER_NAME .
"/chat/chat_login.php';\
\\/\\/-->\
</script>\
";
  }
 }
?>

No matter what I do, however, the file cannot be accessed if it exists and
causes damage galore.  Can anyone out there help me figure out what I did
wrong; I'm completely stumped and may have to rewrite this portion of the
chatroom in TCL, all of my TCL scripts have had NO problems whatsoever
accessing the txt files.

There was a planned meeting to get down and dirty in NYPHP.org's
development this week, but since I have gotten a less-than-enthuisastic
response to a day/time preference, it has been postponed.

I realize people are busy, as I am too, but let's try to do better and
get a new meeting worked out.  Maybe our next general group meeting
should be dedicated for this purpose?  NYPHP.org really needs some
layout/design work.  As I've said, the backend is ready to go - it's
not perfect, but we won't know what else needs to be done until it's
put to use.

>From now on, this type of group business will be carried on the NYPHP
Development list, so if you reply to this message, be sure you are
replying to the correct address (dev at nyphp.org).

Now all I need to figure out how to write a task scheduler on the server end.

Hello,

Someone had released a php compiler last year, that let you make standalone
windows executables - anyone seen it around?  I don't have it anymore, and
can't seem to find it on the net.

Anyone have it, or have a URL where I can grab it from?

Thanks,

Tom

Good Morning,

Last night, just as I was about to go to sleep, I noticed some oddities
with the mail server.  Turns out, for one reason or another (possibly
my doing, although I'm blaming null mounts in FreeBSD) sendmail started
going crazy.  From what I can tell, some of you may have received
duplicate emails from tom at supertom.com - this is sendmail's doing, not
Tom's.  Also, some incoming messages were dropped.  If you posted last
night, and haven't seen your message yet, you'll need to repost.

Everything should be cleared up now, however, with normalcy settling
back in.

Thanks,

Hans Z.

Greetings Fellow LAMP'ers.

I have a student enrollment application I am writing for my employer and I would like to offer the administrator of the system the ability to download a comma seperated dump of the student file for
import into excel.

I'm using the header("Content-type: text/data") and it works, prompting the user to save/open the file - however, it appears that the newline character that I am using to delimit the rows is causing
MS Excel to think that the file is something odd.

The question: I'm use "/n" to break a row - is there another way of printing a cr/lf?  I've tried &crlf and it comes out as a literal "&crlf" in the data file.

Thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer.

Regards,
Mike

Does PHP 4.2.x only work with Apache 1.3.x or does it work well
under the latest and greatest Apache?

The "INSTALL" file says nothing about Apache 2.x, only it's predecessor.
And are the configuration files very different from Apache 1.3.x and 2.x?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Formatting dates
Message-ID: <20020515034040.93338.qmail@web11701.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello:

I would like to know how I can use dates in PHP.

This is what I would like to accomplish:

First I would like to assign a starting date, for
example:
5/11/02.

I would like to add seven days to it so it will be
Sat. May 18th and one day so it can be Sun. May 19th.

I would like to do this for every week. At the same
time, assign a week number according to the date. For
example; May 11th and 12th would be week #1. Now, May
18th and 19th would be week #2 and so on...

I know it will be a problem when the month changes. In
other words what I like to create is a schedule thats
in a database and loaded according to the week_no.

Any idea on how I can accomplish this.

Your help would be very apreciated.

Thank you.

Hi!

I'm not gonna go into details here, but just about all PHP date
functions use the unix timestamp..which may seem a little odd if you are
coming from M$. However, this turns out to be great because it actually
eleminates the problem of going into the next month.

For instance, to print the date, you say something like:

print (date("M Y"));

This will give you "May 2002";

Now, you can use a function called mktime() like this:

$new_timestamp = mktime(0, 0, 0, 5, 15, 2002);

Now if you say,

print (date("M d Y", $new_timestamp));

You will get:

"May 15 2002".

The "next month" problem is solved because if you say,

$new_timestamp = mktime(0,0,0,5,32,2002);

You will get

June 1 2002

Cool huh?

Good luck!

Jeremy

NOTE: Some syntax may be off a bit, but use PHP.net as your reference.
You can type in http://www.php.net/mktime and it will redirect you to
the function definition for mktime(), etc.

Subject: Strange error including PEAR libraries
Message-ID: <OE74NPPzQT456UnHAaa0000e548@hotmail.com>

I am attempting to use PEAR's DB library in a project I'm working on, but am
running into problems including the files in my php scripts. To include the
library, I am using:

require_once 'DB.php';

About 20% of the time, my scripts will execute properly. The other 80% of
the time, I get this error:

Fatal error: Failed opening required 'DB.php' (include_path='') in
/home/dpmusic/public_html/admin/dbconn.php on line 2

Notice the part about the include path, (include_path=''). I did a test
where I tried to include a dummy file with require_once 'foobar.php'; and
got this error:

Fatal error: Failed opening required 'Foobar.php'
(include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php')....

None of my scripts contain anything that modifies the include path. I am
hosted with a pretty reliable company who has always known what they're
doing so it would surprise me if they installed php incorrectly. I would
really like to figure out how to fix this though, it's been bugging me for
weeks. Also, my phpinfo() output says that my include_path is set to
.:/usr/local/lib/php

Several ways of doing this - here is some tips that might help.

define('SECSINDAY', 24*3600);
define('SECSINWEEK', SECSINDAY*7);

$sat_timestamp = $start_timestamp + SECSINWEEK;
$sun_timestamp = $sat_timestamp + SECSINDAY;

Since you'll be starting at an arbitrary date, you'll need to track the
weeks on your own.  However, maybe you could setup an offset, and
subtract that from the yearly week count (using date()).

If your using MySQL, there are some very useful date/time
subtraction/addition functions (DATE_ADD() or something like that).

Hope this helps,

Hmm.. the 20/80% of the time work situation is always tricky.  Somehow,
in the file that you're requiring from, the include path is getting
smacked.  From that same file, test including a file in the current
dir, etc.

If only that file is having problems with including, then check out any
config settings, or oddities in the file it self.  Otherwise, you may
want to contact your provider.  Sounds almost like theres some memory
corruption, although it could be anything I suppose.

API module structure `php4_module' in file /home/apache/libexec/libphp4.so
is garbled - perhaps this is not an Apache module DSO?
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

I compiled Apache 1.3.24 and PHP 4.2.1.  Seems that Apache doesn't like the
SO.  I tried various configurations but I get the same result everytime.

The very same .so file loads up fine when I load it up with the previous
installation?!  But I cannot use it, I am required to recompile the httpd.

Anyone have any insight into this?

Thanks!

Not 100% on the configuration you have, but make sure you are compiling
correlating versions, ie, make sure that you aren't compiling php into
Apache staticly, then trying to load the DSO.  Also, make sure the
source you compile the PHP against as a DSO, is the same version you
are loading it into.

And remember, unless PHP is a DSO, Apache will need to be recompiled!

Good evening folks,

I've written a couple thoughts up, and posted them to the Group Notes
section of http://nyphp.org.  Please take a look at them, and conduct
any further discussion on the Development mailing list (dev at nyphp.org).

Thank you,

I am developing for myself a database application that carries job
related information for the internet - my own small business.  I have
developed scripts for adding and deleting a record, but the script for
update record does not work.  The add record script adds values to all
the fields of a record, and the delete record script deletes whatever
record is selected.  I think the database columns are okay since they
work with these two commands.

The script for the update record consists of three separate scripts. 
The first script selects the record to be modified.  The second script
displays the fields of the record on the screen.  The third script does
the modification with the UPDATE statement.

The script that selects the record and the script that displays the
field information for the record work fine.. the script that modifies
the records does not.

I copied the script from PHP Essentials, written by Julie Meloni.

If someone would be willing to work one on one to look at the three
scripts (record selection, record display, and record modification, i
would greatly appreciate it.....I would like to e-mail them to you as i
do not have a server to post them on, or I can send them by icq or
irc.... here is the third script that is not working (i get no error
message... apparently it is executing but--------:

It would really help if you included the job table definition. 

For example, it appears as though all the fields in the table are
strings. But it seems like the field named "comp_id" should be a number.
If this is the case, then the SQL maybe has a syntax error.

it looks like the update format is not right. ig.
    ===set KEYWORD1 = \\"$keyword1\\",=== 
when it goes to db, it will be 
   ***  set  KEYWORD1 = "XXXXXXX"       ****, 
I don't know MySql, but I guess it will cause a db error,
because the correct sytax for set it could be 
  ++++  set  KEYWORD1 = 'XXXXX', +++++
so I suggest you to use this 
  $$$$ set  KEYWORD1 = '".$keyword1."',  $$$$$
to try for some db fields which need to be quoted by ''.
for fields are numbers, you just do like this:
  %%%% set  NUMBERFIELD = $number, %%%%%

Hope this help you,Good Luck!

something in my script based on variable type....my principal function
in life is business and I would appreciate it if you would catch my
errors....or anyone else....let me start with your suggestion Jeremy.... 

Here are the column types for the database UPDATE problem in my earlier
post:

keyword1 varchar(15) null
keyword2 varchar(15) null
keyword3 varchar(15) null

Ok.

So I created small test to see what would happen if I tried to update a
record using your syntax with PHP/mySQL.

It didn't work. No errors, but it still didn't work. The only major flaw
with my test is that I'm using a straight-up int (int(11)), and you are
using a medium and tiny int. But I'm assuming all numbers should be
addressed the in the same manner.

If you are updating a record, you should not put quotes around the
values for the number fields.

eg:

table test:

name	type
job_id	int(11)

You should not say:

update test set job_id = "23";

You should say:

update test set job_id = 23;

For your update query should be:

$sql = "update jobs set 
KEYWORD1 = \\"$keyword1\\",
KEYWORD2 = \\"$keyword2\\",
KEYWORD3 = \\"$keyword3\\",
KEYWORD4 = \\"$keyword4\\",
KEYWORD5 = \\"$keyword5\\",
COMP_ID = $comp_id,
SHOW_DATE = \\"$show_date\\",
JOB_CAT = $job_cat,
JOB_LOC = \\"$job_loc\\",
JOB_TITLE = \\"$job_title\\",
JOB_DESC = \\"$job_desc\\",
JOB_SALARY = \\"$job_salary\\",
FIRST_NAME = \\"$first_name\\",
LAST_NAME = \\"$last_name\\",
AD_EMAIL = \\"$ad_email\\",
CNTCT_EMAIL = \\"$cntct_email\\",
USR_NAME = \\"$usr_name\\",
P_WORD = \\"$p_word\\",
AD_PHONE = \\"$ad_phone\\",
CNTCT_PHONE = \\"$cntct_phone\\",
AD_FAXPHONE = \\"$ad_faxphone\\",
WEB_SITE = \\"$web_site\\",
CCNAME = \\"$ccname\\",
CCNUMBER = \\"$ccnumber\\",
MONTHEXP = \\"$monthexp\\",
YEAREXP = \\"$yearexp\\",
CCTYPE = \\"$cctype\\",
STREET1A = \\"$street1A\\",
STREET2A = \\"$street2A\\",
STREET3A = \\"$street3A\\",
CC_CITY = \\"$cc_city\\",
CC_STATE = \\"$cc_state\\",
CC_ZIP = \\"$cc_zip\\",
TRBLFONE = \\"$trblfone\\"
where job_id = $job_id";

Note that I have changed job_cat, comp_id and job_id in the where
clause.

This seems to be at least 1 problem.

Good luck and let us know if it works out!

Jeremy, I made that change and got this error message:

You have an error in your SQL syntax near ' SHOW_DATE = "", JOB_CAT = ,
JOB_LOC = "", JOB_TITLE = "",
JOB_DESC = "", ' at line 8.

  Jeremy here is my script for adding the original record to the
database.  Am I doing a automatic type conversion when I add the record
and is that messing up the UPDATE?

I have posted the column types in my earlier post, and I have changed
the script, Jeremy, like you showed me to do, and my question is whether
when I add data to the data base I am doing an automatic type
conversion....Second question: should i change all the columns in the
table to varchar or char since i am not doing any math with the
thing)))))... Thanks for being patient, Jeremy.

You have an error in your SQL syntax near ' SHOW_DATE = "", JOB_CAT =
****NEED SOMETHING HERE**** ,
JOB_LOC = "", JOB_TITLE = "",
JOB_DESC = "", ' at line 8.

Jeremy, I made that change and got this error message:

You have an error in your SQL syntax near ' SHOW_DATE = "", JOB_CAT = ,
JOB_LOC = "", JOB_TITLE = "",
JOB_DESC = "", ' at line 8.

  Jeremy here is my script for adding the original record to the
database.  Am I doing a automatic type conversion when I add the record
and is that messing up the UPDATE?

I have posted the column types in my earlier post, and I have changed
the script, Jeremy, like you showed me to do, and my question is whether
when I add data to the data base I am doing an automatic type
conversion....Second question: should i change all the columns in the
table to varchar or char since i am not doing any math with the
thing)))))... Thanks for being patient, Jeremy.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Mysql UPDATE Problem
In-Reply-To: <200205182038.g4IKcjR13834@slipdisc.virul.net>
References: <200205182038.g4IKcjR13834@slipdisc.virul.net>

I don't really know much about automatic type conversions. But I do see
the job_cat is empty.

You may also want to give your form elements better names...at least I
would.

Anyway, try slimming down your update query and start with a couple of
items only, then work your way up. That's a sure-fire way of narrowing
down the problem. If you start with only one field in your update query,
you know that it's probably something else (such as db permissions).

Give that a shot and see if you can't pinpoint the reason why the record
wont update.

Jeremy


PS: If you still have problems, send me the form and the code off-list
and I may be able to figure out the problem at some point over the next
couple of days...but try narrowing down your update query first!

It seems to me that you have some research to do. Check your code, check
php.net, check the mysql site. What you are trying to do is relatively
simple so you'll most likely find an answer pretty fairly soon.

Jeremy, with one variable to update the program simply does not do it...
there are no error messages or other problems... the script executes but
the single field does not update.  Thanks, Jeremy for your help..

Did you put in quite marks for that one field?
There is no  permissions on a / field basis.
There is a syntax error in your code.... bad grammar type. :)

Subject: XMLRPC or SOAP
Message-ID: <3CE72D37.87F7B361@alum.rpi.edu>

Ok, which should I be considering to use? XML-RPC 
or SOAP? I would like to start a simple webservice 
for data retrieval for parts of my site and was
wondering
which one I should go with. 

It seems as of now that there's more PHP resources
for XML-RPC so it that better? Also if I go with
one of these, 
which PHP implementation is best since there are
quite a few
and most seem to be in alpha stages (not for
production).

Thanks.

the syntax i use, but i'm using Postgres, works fine...

KEYWORD1 = '$keyword1';

and to make it a bit tighter
KW1 = '$kw1';   // KW is close enough to keyword to abbreviate, imho.

I just was able to make the UPDATE command work on some known good code,
Jeremy, so the problem is in my code and not with the data base...I will
be working all night to try and find out what there is that is different
between my code and the known good code that works... I modeled my code
on the known good code so i don't know where i went off track....

Subject: PHPXref 0.2a
Message-ID: <F108bXS0FhKktkpgnkT00001df1@hotmail.com>

Hi, I have just released a modified version of PHPXref, a PHP documentation 
tool, similar to LXR.

See http://www.liquidmarkets.com/m.php?m=News&file=article&sid=3

An example of the output is here: http://www.liquidmarkets.com/phpxref/
This shows documentation for phpSQLGen and php4/pear (PEAR 2002-05-19 22:36 
GMT snapshot).

PHPXref was written by Gareth Watts, with contributions from Gottfried Szing 
and myself.

The PHPXref home page is here: http://phpxref.sourceforge.net/.
I made the following modifications:
+ Fixed an issue that was preventing the script from working on Windows
+ Changed the regular expressions to match the standard Javadoc/PHPDoc 
comment marker (/**) for functions.
Used ## for the file comment marker.
+ Added the pre tag for function comments so that example code comments will 
be formatted correctly.
+ Increased font size

This modified version is available here:
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/m.php?m=Downloads&req=viewdownload&cid=2

There could be any number of problems, however I would start by looking
at the SQL that actually gets generated and try to clean things up a
bit.  Although this maybe not be helpful at all, I've attached a file
with some formatting/etc you may want to consider.

I personally dispise the "or die()" scheme (too Perly) so I've used
if() statements.  The real important things to consider is 1) I always
like to supply what connection handle I want to deal with - otherwise
things can get confusing if you have multiple database handles.  2) the
key for large SQL statements is to print it out and examine it if you
have problems.

Of course you may not need so many mysql_escape_string() calls,
depending on the data source, and you'll have to check that your column
types are all agreeable, DB perms, etc.

Hope this helps,

Hans Z.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XMLRPC or SOAP
In-Reply-To: <200205190443.g4J4hXR15423@slipdisc.virul.net>

Interesting subject, as I've just been pondering the same issues. 
Thanks to the wonders of Barnes and Noble, I did a lot of free reading
this weekend on this very thing, actually.

While I am by far not an expert at this point (and will tend to throw
my personal bias in) I like XMLRPC much more.  SOAP, while it wants to
be good, is just too bloated.  Of all things XML, XMLRPC looks nicest
(IMHO) and I've seen the most written about:

http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/main.php?t=php_about
http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/

A little XML rant follows:  While XML means well, and is an interesting
idea, it just doesn't make any sense to use, what esssentially is HTML,
to markup so much varied data.  To me, data should be organized
properly in the first place, and XML becomes quite worthless.  After
browsing many books on all things related I've realized that XML
requires an ENOURMOUS overhead, both human and computational.  That
said, I do think there must exist good uses for XML and related
technologies (ie enhanced HTML, or what's really XHTML), however I'm
just going to be careful not to think XML is a panacea for all data. 
Lastly, I've been doing some web service stuff lately as well and have
been using strictly PHP serializing - it works great, is fast, and if
it really needs to be in XML for another language, there are
converters.

Sorry for the rant - flames are welcome. :)

Hans, thank you for your help... the problem is in the UPDATE statement 
and the fact that the variables $keyword1, $keyword2, etc, in the
statement have no values.  IOW the values that are in the text boxes in
script 2 where the current data is are not carried to script 3 where the
UPDATE statement is located when the modify table button is pressed. 
You know Hans, I have successfully updated records with this form of the
UPDATE statement just yesterday with a small test table i wrote, and
when i go back and try it with the table I am using and it does not
work, i.e. the values of the variables are not passing from the second
to the third script, i wonder if my browser is screwing me up... I have
netscape 4.5 that i am running....I will try $HTTP_POST_VARS[xxx] and
see if i can pick up the values in the array when the second script is
submitted.  Thanks Hans for your help on all this and on getting me onto
the forum where i can get assistance.  Jerry

The main issue is that XMLRPC is so much more simpler than SOAP but gets
alot less press and hype ... so if/when you decide to build a web service
the odds are that most of the clients connecting are going to be expecting
a SOAP Envelope and if you are XMLRPC they are not gonna get it ... so keep
the "client market" in mind ...

I had this problem with the Alicebot stuff, deciding what is more useful
since I did not need the types of SOAP (remember SOAP has a wide variery of
types compared to XMLRPC) so if you are working with something more
complex, you really should use SOAP ...

And to create a simple XML envelope structure is really not rocket science
... +1 for SOAP ...

Of course a handy function here is phpinfo(); 

However, keep in mind the globalicity (ie, if you're in a function). 
var_dump($HTTP_POST_VARS); and print_r($HTTP_POST_VARS);  are great
too, when phpinfo(); is overkill.

My pleasure,

Jerry,

Try this on the page you submit to:

print "<PRE>";
print_r($HTTP_POST_VARS);
print "</PRE>";

It will let you see the whole thing easily. By the way, I didn't have time to look at the code you sent me. Please make sure you're indeed using the POST method on the forms and not using GET.

Oktay, i get all the data in the array... but when i try to write an
assignment statement i get a parse error.  I write :

keyword1 = '".$HTTP_POST_VARS["a1"]."'  


That gives a parse error... do you know how to write it correctly,
Oktay?  I appreciate your time very much....

Jerry

Sure.. you're cascading double quotes incorrectly.. you have to escape the ones inside.. if you look at your example below.. you're opening the double quotes right before $HTTP_... then the next time a double quote is encouontered, PHP will think it's the closing double quote.. in this case right before a1..... which is incorrect.  try the following.. you seem to be quoting too much. 

keyword1 = ' $HTTP_POST_VARS[a1] '

Xref looks cool, my question is, what exactly is Liquid Markets?  Looks 
like the beginnings of something interesting, but i can't really find a 
mission like statement, maybe i'm just missing it...

thanks...

Hello to all

I am new to both Mysql and PHP.  I found this list by accident and have

basic and fundamental information.  Books, websites, How to's that sort 
of thing.  If there are specifics that stand out above the rest or are 
considered a must read please tell me.  I hate to buy books only to find

The most useful PHP book in my library is the PHP CookBook. I'm pretty
sure it's by NewRiders, but I certainly could be wrong. It's great! You
should at least check it out. It's white and red...ish.

Good luck!

My suggestion is as follows:
1) www.php.net -- probably your best source of documentation
	a)you can find stuff easy if you kinda know what you're looking for 
	e.g. (www.php.net/mysql)
2) www.mysql.com -- same as 1...for mysql
3) get a book (I can't advise you on which one. I've read a few...none
	really stand out. I'm sure someone else can assist you w/ that)
4) play around w/ ideas...try new things....it will speed up the process.
5) if you can...look at other people's code. down load some open source
	stuff from freshmeat.net just to look at it...it will show you how to write
	better code (hopefully -- there is a lot of bad code out there -- [but
	you'll notice it when you see it])
hope that helps.
good luck...and welcome.

There are many options - here are a couple:

-- Come to tonight's meeting.  There is always time to ask questions
and network with other coders.

-- Ask questions on the list.

-- Search google.com using terms like "php", "beginner", "tutorial",
"newbie", "article", etc

Once you get up to speed a little, I recommend Programming PHP from
O'Reilly (I have a copy I'm bringing to the meeting tonight) and the
WROX PHP books.  Although there are a lot of easy tutorial books on
PHP, I would shy away from them - you can learn all that easily online
- save your money for more advanced books.

Hope this helps,

Hans Z.

First and foremost, the documentation at php.net is outstanding. That is
always the first place to check when stuck with a problem. In terms of
getting introduced to mySQL and php, I've found that there are some very
good faqs out there for setup and such (just google it). If you're looking
for something to buy, "PHP and MySQL Web Development" from SAMS by Welling
and Thomson is a really useful walkthrough of some standard PHP type apps
you'll probably want to write at some point.

Hi Paul,

It also depends on your current knowledge.
If you have previous experience with databases and server side web development
(perl, cold fusion, asp, etc) then the online reference manuals should
be enough.
If databases are new to you, I cannot emphasise enough the need for a
good SQL book (like http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201447878/)

With some more info on your current knowledge, I could be more specific
regarding books.

hope that helps,
Ophir

I'm new to MySQL and PHP too, but not new to databases and programming. I
started with MySQL by Paul DuBois, which also briefly goes into interfacing
PHP, Perl and C with MySQL. I thought it was an excellent book for beginners
and intermediates. It starts with your typical relational database design
tutorial, which you can skip, but also includes security guidelines and
database maintenance. It's pretty thorough if you are looking to get
started.

I bought another book at the same time called PHP and MySQL Web Development
by Luke Welling and Laura Thomson. It's ok, but could be organized better.
It's one of those "SAMS" books, which I never liked. I should have known
better.

I'm sorry I won't be able to make tonight's meeting, I just started looking
into PEAR and am a little lost so far.

Paul,

- The book I always go back to is 'Web Application Development with PHP 4.0' from New Riders by T.Ratschiller & T.Gerken.

- For PHP/MySQL development I'd recommend 'MySQL/PHP Database Applications' from M&T Books by J. Greenspan & B.Bulger

- http://www.DevShed.com/ has some great PHP and MySQL articles, as well as some very active discussion forums on different open source web technologies (including PHP & MySQL of course)

- You should find some very good reads at http://www.onlamp.com/php/  and  http://www.onlamp.com/onlamp/general/mysql.csp

Have fun,
Jerry

What Im looking for is how to build a very simple "Hello World" C extension for
PHP, or @ least how to build PHP on Windows without Visual C (using Cygwin) ...
I attempt it and php.h creates a huge mess ...

Is there any advantage (speed-wise) to using a native MySQL C extension u have
built vs. using the built-in methods?

Get the new Programming PHP by Rasmus from O'Reilly - most in-depth
coverage of PHP extension/internal I've seen so far (if anyone knows of
anything better (besides the source) do tell!).  There is also
http://www.zend.com/apidoc/ which is very good.  Both about cover the
same, but each fills in a little.

> or @ least how to build PHP on Windows without Visual C (using

Not sure about this, but in Rasmus' book they cover Windows
configuration, etc.  I don't know the details, but I'll have the book
at the meeting tonight so you can check it out.

Hmm, I doubt it.  PHP and MySQL have been like bread and butter from
the beginning and the extension has been developed by members of each
team.  When compiled against mysql's libraries, the extension is about
as native as you can get.

Good morning all,

I've updated http://nyphp.org's frontpage with a couple notes that
might be interesting.  I'll be updateing the Group Notes section later,
as well.

However most important is that we start to build our knowledge base.  

To the presenters last night: if you haven't already, please send me
notes/links/etc about your presentation.  I saw many people using note
paper and web page links.  If you could write this up in an
article-type format, that'd be great - if not, just send me the raw
notes and I'll "compile" it into a reasonable form.  We're not looking
for anything fancy at this point, but I just want to get the resources
online.

Also, to anyone else who took notes last night, please send anything
you found interesting to me and I'll compile it as well.  And, the
position for NYPHP Clerk/Secretary is still open!

I was thinking this morning:  if I setup a group weblog thing, would
people put useful info there (from meetings, and even just general
notes)?  Then I or other editors could compile it down to article-type
formats, link lists, etc.  Feedback on this please.

Either way, since we're getting great presentations, we need a way to
track/record the information.

Thanks folks, and I look forward to next week's development meeting
(all are welcome).

Hans Z.

Subject: Making URLs Search Engine Friendly - Follow Up
Message-ID: <20020523144340.JEVL4876.mta09.onebox.com@onebox.com>


Hi All,

I wanted to go over a few items as a follow up to my presentation last
night (ok - I forgot to look at my notes :)

1. I don't know how I forgot to mention this, but one of the biggest
disadvantages of the PATH_INFO method is that it does not work with cgi
versions of PHP.
As in the nature of yesterday's presentation - does anyone know what
error you get and why it doesn't work with cgi versions of PHP ?

2. When making your URLs search engine friendly, there is an advantage
of using URLs that looks like an .html file (and not just a path, as
often done with the PATH_INFO method).
In the future, if you should want to make any of your pages truly static,
it makes life easier.
For example, one of the pages on my web site was getting a lot of traffic,
so instead of having it be created on the fly, I simply created a crontab
entry that once a day grabbed the dynamic page and saved it to a static
page. Something like this:
wget http://www.mysite.com/dynamic-version.php -o static-version.html

Just a side note - I no longer do it this way, but instead use a output
caching object to get almost the same performance gain.

3. Someone asked how do I make ANY file in a directory be treated like
a PHP file, regardless of filename (under apache of course). Add this
line in your .htaccess file for the directory you want to use:

ForceType application/x-httpd-php   (or whatever mime type you use for
php)

For more details see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#forcetype

I've created an example at:
http://www.consolemonkey.com/nyphp/allphpfiles/example/name/ophir/city/nyc.html
(I'll leave it up to the reader to write the regex to remove the .html
from the PATH_INFO so your last value won't have .html appended to it
;)

Hope you all learned something.

I took a quick google and didn't come up with much.  However I noticed
that Verity (VDK) supports COM, which PHP supports as well
(php.net/com).  There are also some ways to bridge PHP and Java
(php.net/java), but I'm not sure if it's at the level to be of use
here.  There is also the PEAR SOAP library, which might be useful here.
 Either way, I've never used any of these, so I'm flying blind.

Thanks for the feedback.  Sorry, I missed the meeting last night.  My
company had a softball game.  BTW, we (NYPHP) should also plan to gather at
a bar sometime.  This way, people can network better.

G'morn all,

	Weblog? Blah! A web forum would be more useful to the members.
I suggest breakin' it up into different areas, for example:

	o "Member Discussions/Chat/Issues/Etc",
	o "Meeting Minutes/Log"(static area only "webmaster" can update),
	o "Previous Presentations"
	o "Reference Area"(maybe, alot of reference sites out there already)
	o "Member CODEZ!"
	  (stuff written by members, I'm sure many will love to contribute
to this ;)
	o "Club Rules and Related-Junk"
	o "LAMP Book Library"
	  (Overdue books? List of books available with an accompaning book
review)
	o "Kool Zites" - (Member Recommended Sites with description/review)
	o etc etc etc

There are free forum services out there, or better yet... 
download some php(of course) based web forum app and put it on nyphp.org.

My 3 cents,
-Ed

Good morning all,

I've updated http://nyphp.org's frontpage with a couple notes that
might be interesting.  I'll be updateing the Group Notes section later,
as well.

However most important is that we start to build our knowledge base.  

To the presenters last night: if you haven't already, please send me
notes/links/etc about your presentation.  I saw many people using note
paper and web page links.  If you could write this up in an
article-type format, that'd be great - if not, just send me the raw
notes and I'll "compile" it into a reasonable form.  We're not looking
for anything fancy at this point, but I just want to get the resources
online.

Also, to anyone else who took notes last night, please send anything
you found interesting to me and I'll compile it as well.  And, the
position for NYPHP Clerk/Secretary is still open!

I was thinking this morning:  if I setup a group weblog thing, would
people put useful info there (from meetings, and even just general
notes)?  Then I or other editors could compile it down to article-type
formats, link lists, etc.  Feedback on this please.

Either way, since we're getting great presentations, we need a way to
track/record the information.

Thanks folks, and I look forward to next week's development meeting
(all are welcome).

Hans Z.

A web forum would indeed be useful.

Anybody brought up the idea of using a content management system such as
PHP-Nuke? I've implemented PHP-Nuke for a number of sites and found the
setup and use fairly easy, and it comes with plenty of features built-in,
such as forums, downloads, links, etc.

Personally I think a wiki tool is exactly what the group needs.
I've installed twiki (http://www.twiki.org) at a few places and it's
been VERY helpfull. Yes, I know it's perl and not PHP, but I don't know
of any PHP based wikis with such an extensive feature set.

In your apache error log you get a message like:
[Thu May 23 10:36:46 2002] [error] [client 209.176.7.100] Premature end of script headers: /www/cgi-bin/php
and a 500 Internal server error is shot to the browser.

I haven't dug around to find out exactly WHY this is, but here's
what I've gathered from my experience with it. It seems that the
PHP binary is passed the path of the script to run, which will
include the PATH_INFO.  So when it tries to execute it, it dies
because there is no script named that.  PHP should parse that
path to the first script it finds and treat the rest as PATH_INFO
data.... but it doesn't.

Anyone have any more insight into this?

You hit the nail on the head.

If you run PHP as a cgi, when you enter http://www.mysite.com/stuff/blah.php?id=5
What is happening behind the scenes is that apache passes the URL / script
path to the PHP cgi executable, and then the cgi takes it from there.
If the script doesn't exist, the php executable chokes since it can't
find the script!
This brings out another disadvantage of using php as a CGI.
Any URL that apache thinks is a php file will be sent to the php cgi,
and will choke if the file does not exist. This means it's very difficult
to catch 404 errors with php file.

> PHP should parse that
> path to the first script it finds and treat the rest as PATH_INFO

Passing a script data via the URL using "/" is a feature that apache
implements, not php itself. I'm sure the PHP tream could implement this
if they wanted to, but I don't think any problems related to running
php as a cgi are high priority ;)

Subject: Last night's notes?
Message-ID: <188710-220025423183748109@softwareprototypes.com>

Hello Hans,

I'm extremely sorry I missed last night's meeting. I wanted to bring
in my TiBook wich I use for demoes which is running Apache 1.3.23,
php 4.1.2, MySQL-3.32.39, phpWiki-1.3.3, phpMyAdmin-2.2.4 and some
other things. I've even installed ZendStudio_Client 2.0 Beta.
Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to get ZendStudio_Server
working on my slackware box.

But duty, and a job possibility, called. I hope it wasn't for
naught...

A Blog, like phpSlash, would allow to build a searchable message
stream and that would not be a bad idea. That develops a sense of
community very quickly (specially with as small a community as the NY
PHP User's Group.) 

But for peristence of information, organization, searchability, and
so on, all stuff you want in a knowledge base, you'll want a Wiki,
(like phpwiki.)

The stuff that worth keeping from the blog can be moved over onto
wiki pages and that information becomes a web accessible resource. In
fact phpwiki is extensible by using plug-ins written in php so you
might want to integrate the blog into a wiki page to ease the
transfer.

I've got some time available but I have to earn some dough. Would the
position of blog monitor/moderator be a paying one? (If not now, then
soon?) That will be a major time sponge.

If you decide to go for a wiki (and I think you whould, look at the
wikipedia for some inspiration,)that will also need a
montor/moderator backup scheduler etc... That would mesh in well with
the duties of the blog monitor/moderator.

Hi,

I bought ZendStudio 2.0 Client & Server. While I was able to install
_Client stuff without a hitch,  the _Server is proving to be a bear
to install on my slackware-8 box.

Basically their installer (a perl script) sucks. It asks questions
that I can't figure out or can't find/disambiguate the right answer
to. (I do "find / -name '<whatever>' -print" and come up with X
answers, which one am I supposed to use?)

End result... I've wasted my money for want of some explanations.

Does anybody want to earn my eternal gratitude, some nosh &
brewskies, coming to my house in Jersey City and helping me with this
recalcitrant install?

Yes, contacting Support is worth a try of course, but don't expect them to admit 
their bugs.  They sure didn't with me.

When you insist on your $ back, the passphrase is persistence pays.

Hi,

I don't want my money back, 

I want the thing to work. It works on RedHat, or so I've heard... 

But my directory structure is slackware8 with some mods by a sys
admin friend of mine to my box to give me dual drives mirroring each
other.

I hate to think that I'm going to have to screw up my system as it
stands now just because they don't know how to write an installer
script. I really don't want to lose all my settings, etc, to install
RedHat over my current, working, system.

I've had too many systems crash on me to ever trust my web site, even
though its just a little vanity piece right now, to a single drive
system again. Even if I do burn my backups to a rotation of CD-RWs
everyday and to CD-ROM every week.

The problem with the ZendStudio_Server installer is that it sucks
eggs. And the yoke's on YOU.

Its BAD. Real CLI amateur-hour crap. Make a mistake and it crashes on
you and didn't store the answers you gave it the last time so you
have to re-type everything all over again. I have a neurological
problem so this is a real pain in the [expletive deleted]. Sometimes
it might be my typing or maybe not. All I know is that it fails to
install.

There is no documentation explaining the nature of the questions its
asking and there's no info to help you disambiguate when you find
multiple directories with the same name. (Which one's right? How the
[expletive deleted] should I know?)

Their support is no great shakes. They don't seem to understand that
their installer sucks. The last time we emailed back and forth, they
referred me to their http://www.zend.com/install_instruct.php page
which says:
- - - 
          * Download the Zend Studio Server package and place it in a
temporary folder on your machine.
          * Login as root, or a user with superuser privileges.
          * Extract the .tar.gz file you have downloaded:
               1. tar xzvf
ZendStudioServer-x.x.x-Linux_glibc21-i386.tar.gz
               2. Then, run the script ./install.sh (for dialog
based) or ./install-tty.sh (for command line interface)
               3. And follow the instructions in the installation
script.
- - -

Yeah.... Right...

               3. And follow the instructions in the installation
script.

The instructions in the installation script are terrible, obscure,
non-intuitive, not the least descriptive and impossible to actually
follow if you need to deviate from a stock standard install and can't
just keep hitting enter.

That's why I'm inviting some total stranger, any total stranger who
could help, to my house for food and beer. Then we'll write up what
the problem was, how we solved it and shove that back at Zend with a
big "Thank's for nothing" note attached.

Well I don't think I can make it to Jersey City any time soon, but post
what the questions are it asks you that are giving you trouble and
maybe we can get you started.  The Perl script may very well be poorly
written, but Slackware is known for not being "your average" Linux
distro these days; altough I'd never leave it.

Hi Charles and others,

I threw up phpWiki at http://dev.nyphp.org/wiki.  It is the raw
install, so it's looking for someone to play with.  I'll give the admin
password to anyone who wants, or if multiple people want to play with
it, I can setup other instances easily.

I've also installed Phorum (great package) at
http://dev.nyphp.org/phorum.  As above, it is the raw install and
looking for some attention.  I can also setup multiple instances if
more than one person wants to play with it.

I tried setting up phpWeblog (http://phpweblog.org) but it is junk as
far as I can tell, so it's not working (http://dev.nyphp.org/weblog). 
Maybe when they release their "final" version (any other PHP
implementations of this?)

If anyone knows of other programs they'd like to see setup to play
with, let me know.  Right now I can't do Perl stuff because of the
server setup.

I really don't know much about how these things work (I'm still not
sure the real difference between a weblog and wiki) so I'd like someone
to play around with these.

I don't want to have too many seperate systems going for communication,
but at this initial stage I feel that it will be best to have multiple
software possibilties up, and then they can be refined and whatever
people like the best we'll keep.  So, multiple people are welcome to
work on any number of these packages, or others.  Just let me know what
needs to be setup/changed.

Let's move this discussion to NYPHP Development (so don't just hit
reply!)

Thanks,

Hans Z.

Hello Hans,

good thing I'm NOT in a hurry. Still I'd like it installed before the
next php course (May's got "canceled".)

I'll grant that slackware is perhaps not your run-of-the-mill distro,
(atually it respects the Linux directory structure more than RedHat
does.) No customized set up will be perfectly compliant with any
scheme. Which makes explanation of the installer questions and their
answers even more important.

Installing on Mac OS X would be a breeze since the ONLY way is the OS
X way and the OS X installers don't have to contend with any
directory variance. Apps go in the Applications folder or one of its
subfolders and that's that. Host servable Web documents go in
"<startUpDisk>:Library:WebServer:Documents:" User documents go in
"<startUpDisk>:Users:<user>:Sites:"

However,the Linux world is NOT Mac OS X. Its important to provide
good information so that installation can occur on the various
distributions. I think its a pain that only RedHat's directory
structure is supported right out of the tar file but that's my
opinion. 

Still, its inexcusable that Zend does not provide enough information
to let people who are using another distro to "roll their own". I'm
getting used to doing this since RedHat is our 800lb Gorilla
regardless of what I might think, but can't claim to be thrilled at
this "contre-temps" since it only the crappyness of the installation
instructions that stands between me, multi-platform clients and a
usable ZendStudio Server.

It certainly is not.  One problem with Linux (and UNIX through the
ages) is variance.  Linux is no exception, and it's openness probably
intensifies these problems.

In addition, commercial products are notoriously finicky, especially on
Linux.  I just went through an Oracle, ARCServe and AntiVirus install
on RedHat.  Even taking the most "ceritifiable" and commercial version
of Linux, and using the commercial software for THAT VERY version,
caused enormous pain.  And if you think Zend's installer doesn't give
much detail, try Computer Associates - worse yet, CA won't give you
support if you've even modified your system beyond their "certified"
vision of a system, which must be a industry secret, since they're very
illusive (ignorant) as to what that exactly means. (CA makes Microsoft
look like Apache).

It's the nature of the beast, perhaps the fault of the vendor, perhaps
Linux; probably somewhere in the middle.  Open Source, say hello to
commercial vendors.

If you'd like to post some details I/we'd be glad to help.  If you
like, I could even ssh into your box and see what I can see.

Subject: Solaris installs/users?
Message-ID: <F261KAlOp6oQr3bIh9D0000681f@hotmail.com>

Greetings all,

I'm wondering if anyone here has experience installing PHP - or the other 
regulars MySQL/PostgreSQL, Tomcat, and Apache - on a desktop Solaris 8 
machine.

I've been doing local development with Windows 2000/IIS and Mac OS X/Apache 
and deploying them to outsourced Linux hosts for a while now, but I'd like 
to mess around with configuring this Solaris machine on my local network to 
be a staging/experimental server of sorts.

Most of the documentation I've been using over the years has been 
Linux/BSD/Windows related so it's about 85% helpful for what I want to do, 
but I would also like to get a feel for any potential pitfalls before I 
really start messing with the SPARC box (I'm not exactly a Unix guru...).

So, does anyone have warnings or anecdotes that might come in handy?


Thanks in advance,
Dan

My five-cent explanation:
The distinguishing feature of a wiki is that its pages are publicly
writable, and through the "intermap" mechanism, different wikiwebs can
link to pages in each other.  I've been using a Perl-based wiki for a
while now as a knowledge base.  Wikis sort of take on a life of their
own.

Weblogs are generally writable only by one or a small group of selected
posters.  Many blogs don't have any sort of public commenting facility
either.

Hello Hans,

a wiki is a collaborative, adaptive environment. The last thing you
want to do is set up multiple copies. That would defeat the purpose...

How stock is your wiki install? 

What's the persistence mechanism? Did you create/use MySQL tables?

You might want to let me onto your box and set you up properly. For
one thing the site looks anemic. There are several attractive themes
to choose from (I use MacOSX myself at
http://wage.packet.org/phpwiki-1.3.3/index.php though Hawaiian is
very nice,) or we should create a distinctive NY php User's Group
theme.

I have already played with the wiki. Its the latest version and we
have GOT to get it looking like it belongs so it can earn its place
on the site's menu bar. :-) 

I'm not going to mess around any more until I know its running on
MySQL and getting backed up every day (I burn mine to a rotation of
CD-RWs with weekly burns to CD-Rs I've got some community groups
actually starting to use it so I take it seriously now.)

- - - -

A weblog is like "/.", or www.MacSlash.com , www.RadioFreeNation.net
or www.sensibleerection.com where items get contributed by the
community, get read and commented on by site visitors, scroll of the
end of the site lead page and pretty much disappear for ever. 

A wiki is VERY different. 

Its a 'soup' of web pages generated from database records/rows. These
pages can be linked in a network of relationships. These pages don't
persist unless you get really sneaky and know how to implement cache
registration and invalidation and put it in the wiki engine,) but the
database record/rows which were used to generate them does persist.

Creating pages is ridiculously easy. Edit a page that seems like a
good place to create a page at (a subtopic or sumt'in',) create a
PageName (a string of contiguously catenated Capitalized Words, like
'CapitalizedWords') and save the page. It will reappear with a '?'
following the CapitalizedWords. Click on the '?' and you'll get a new
page to create.

Type away and save the page and you have created the page and a link
to it.

Edit any other page and anywhere you have the CapitalizedWords you
will have a link to the CapitalizedWords page. A page can have
several kinds of links. I have created a page which links to the
phorum. Check out the RecentVisitor's page too. Its got a table with
an animated graohic in one of the cells. 

That page should also contain META-information about the phorum (WTF
is it? How you use it? Administer it? Install it? Where can you
obtain it from? etc.)

- - - -

Somebody will have to decide what phorums we might want to have. I
suggest nothing until I read some more (did you install the docs?)

- - - -

I'm not sure about phpWeblog. If they're using it to run their site,
I'm not greatly impressed. Actually, I don't think people use "/."
like systems for anything serious. You might want to go with phpNuke
instead. I have actually found a site that uses phpNuke (Be warned
its a self-styled "Portal of Porn" at http://portal.900.ee/ ) Its
very "/."-like in format if not in, uh, content. At least it shows
that phpNuke works. Does anybody know of a less embarassing site to
use?

- - - -

You might want to get snipegallery
(http://www.snipe.net/geek/scripts/ ) installed to set up galleries
of images, pictures of events, members who are't camera shy, etc.

- - - -

You have, of course, installed phpMyAdmin I hope.

hello all,

wiki is indeed impressive, and worth considering. i mentioned phpNuke in an
earlier post and will mention it again, only because it is based on PHP and,
well, isn't that what this group is all about?

I have a few NON-porn (and non-commerical) sites running it, and you can see
one of them at http://amoeba.janish.com

Since the platform allows you to build customized modules with PHP, it may
be worth taking a look at, as it would be good practice for the community to
build in the features we need.

There is a philosophical difference between Blogs and Discussion Boards. 
I view bloggers as "Personnel Newswires". A discussion board can act 
like a blog and a blog can act like a discussion board.

Guys,

I got forwarded this letter, and I want to try and gain as much as possible 
from it, in terms of improving the installations so that they fit 
everyone's needs.  I just want you to know that the guys @Zend are really 
not Redhat-centric, and that installations get tested on most of the big 
distros.  It's impossible to support them all, but we do try :)

One thing I firmly believe in is that 'assumption is the mother of all 
mess-ups' (that's the G rated version) - in this case, we assume that 
everything's fine because we don't get bug reports, and you assume that 
we're aware of these problems and feel frustrated that we don't care about 
them enough to fix them.  In reality, apparently, there are problems, but 
we're not aware of them, and the result is negative...  Sorry for the short 
lecture :)

As for the problems with the installation, the Perl script, assumptions 
that you believe we make erroneously, unclear questions - please let me 
know about them.  I promise that we'll do our best to fix them in the next 
release (which is coming out very shortly).

Thanks,

Zeev

Hello Zeev,

there are several things about the script that you might consider
re-doing. This is criticism but its constructive criticism. That's
the kind that leads to better products.

Dialog control:

It should consist of the script, [split into two parts: 1) data
collection/validation and 2) execution,] and a control file of
labels, explanations and defaults which would at least record user
input after every question and allow recovery of keystrokes in case
of a "failure to proceed" 

I'd use an XML format file with the following information:

<questions>
 <question>
  <number> # 
  </number>
  <text> some meaningful ascii string. Not just the word "root," 
    but the root of WHAT? Avoid purely generic words.
    (this makes internationalization easy:
    just replace the text) 
  </text>
  <explanation> some meaningful ascii string which explains
    what the desired value might be and some hints as to how
    to disambiguate when the user might find many posible values.
    This should definitely avoid generic words since you want to
    get the user to provide specific answers.
    (this also makes internationalization easy:
    just replace the explanation)
  </explanation>
  <default> some value 
  </default>
  <validation> some Perl code to verify the value (possibly a
    function/method name to execute which is passed the user
    supplied/accepted value) 
  </validation>
  <actual> recorded keystrokes/accepted default, validated value
  </actual>
  <ok> NIL | F 
  </ok>
 </question>
 ...
</questions>

Dialog flow:

The script should gather all user input first, recording it in the
XML file and then proceed to the installation portion using the
<actual> information recorded in the XML file. 

When an value leads to a script's "failure to proceed" if should, if
possible, set the <ok> flag to false when it encounters a value that
leads to script failure (monitor the return values from processes you
fork off and synch with on their termination.)

If you wanted to get fancy, you might place 
  <condition> value, #
  </condition> 
and be able to implement a finite state machine which would give you
some "make" like control and capabilities.

Human-Machine Interface:

The creation of the <explanation> tags is really necessary. Without
them, even my SysAdmin friend who set up my slackware-8 box and
modified it to increase its robustness, doesn't want to attempt it.

Charles,

Thanks for the input.  To be honest, we're not in a position where we'd 
consider redoing the entire design of the installation from scratch right 
now, so these far-reaching changes you suggest are probably not going to 
happen in the foreseeable future (even though it would have been a Good 
Thing).    There's simply no time to start doing that from scratch.

I'm still interested in fixing the problems that were found, even if we 
don't turn it to an ideal recoverable installation program.  I'm especially 
interested in hearing about the problems that people bumped into, which 
originally sparked this thread - specific texts you found to be unclear, 
incompatibilities with the way certain distributions are laid out, etc.

Thanks,

Zeev

Charles,

Thanks for the input.  To be honest, we're not in a position where we'd 
consider redoing the entire design of the installation from scratch right 
now, so these far-reaching changes you suggest are probably not going to 
happen in the foreseeable future (even though it would have been a Good 
Thing).    There's simply no time to start doing that from scratch.

I'm still interested in fixing the problems that were found, even if we 
don't turn it to an ideal recoverable installation program.  I'm especially 
interested in hearing about the problems that people bumped into, which 
originally sparked this thread - specific texts you found to be unclear, 
incompatibilities with the way certain distributions are laid out, etc.

Thanks,

Zeev

Hello Zeev,

I'm smiling at the irony of the situation right now. 

You're at the center of an open source software world.

The quality and usefullness of php are without doubt. 

I'm sure that many people would want to help with your installer. If
you ask people to lend you a hand with rewriting it, you have a pool
of millions installations to ask. 

For all we know somebody out there has already done it or has an
installer with the features you need: 
 XML control file. 
 Easy internationalization, 
 Explanation text, 
 Recording of selections,
 Recoverable process.

Maybe you should put something up on your web site and see if there
are any takers.

I have time tomorrow so 
- I'll go through the installation again, 
- record all the question the installer asks and
- all my questions about what I'm supposed to provide as an answer.

You'll have a detailed email by Saturday night.

-Charles-A.

I haven't used sockets, but http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sockets.php's 
example 1 meantions streaming.  Maybe that could be a starting point.

unfortunately, I have *very* little expierence with Solaris.  However,

even come standard at this point.  If they are, I would imagine things
should work without a lot of pain.  I Googled for "php solaris apache"
and got what appeared to be some useful results.  Also, maybe a look at
some of the automatic install systems would be of use (the name of the
major one escapes me at the moment).

I'd be curious as to how it turns out - if you find anything useful or
jot down some notes, this could be an interesting article.

The nature of HTTP doesn't permit this.  However, HTTP/1.1 does allow
for persistent connections.  With some handy-work you might be able to
keep the connection up, and have the browser poll the server, however
this doens't really get you that much.  I think this really needs to be
implemented client-side, ie, have javascript or something refresh every
few seconds, or so (not the whole page, necessarily, but maybe a little
frame/piece of the page).  One poster spoke of using Flash, which is a
very exciting technology.  A friend of mine uses Flash a lot and knows
how this would work - unfortunatley I do not.

Subject: Upgrading php problem....
Message-ID: <3CF3BAA3.8030603@well.com>

ok, so i figure time to upgrade php.   Downloaded to /usr/local/etc/, 
install everything, make install runs fine. Then I do phpinfo() and I 
keep getting the OLD version. So i do a which, and it says that 
rackspace has configured php like this in /bin: [moral do a which before 
hand!]

-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      1105740 Jul 16  2001 php
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          426 Jul 16  2001 php-config
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          593 Jul 16  2001 phpextdist
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          688 Jul 16  2001 phpize


And of course my /usr/local/etc looks like this [where i've installed 
apache]:

lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           24 May 28 11:56 php -> 
/usr/local/etc/php-4.2.1
drwxrwxr-x   16 root     root         4096 May 28 11:48 php-4.2.1
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root     18974720 May 28 11:26 php-4.2.1.tar
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           29 May 28 11:25 httpd -> 
/usr/local/etc/apache_1.3.22/
drwxr-xr-x   13 root     root         4096 May 28 11:24 apache_1.3.22

SO THE QUESTION IS:  [yes, i tried symbolic links, did not work.] Before 
I start hacking away [probably in the startup scripts], is there an easy 
way to just remap something here?  The configuration that rackspace 
provided seems VERY different then what the regular php install writes 
out. SINCE everything has been working great, I dont want to have to 
reinstall postgres, apache, etc.

thanks
ed

Hans & Spencer,

Thanks for all the tips.  Googling with that particular string seems to have 
done me quite well as well as the GCC info from both of you.

I will try to work on configuring the machine this weekend and whether I run 
into problems or not I'll report what I find to the list.

Thanks again,

Ick.. this IS an odd install structure (why everything in
/usr/local/etc? personally, I make /usr/local/apache and
/usr/local/php).

Anyway, it looks like /bin/php is a binary, and the link
/usr/local/etc/php is a link to a dir. Assuming the new php lives in
/usr/local/etc/php-4.2.1 and that permissions are ok (which they look
to be), maybe something like:

mv /bin/php /bin/php.original
ln -s /usr/local/etc/php-4.2.1/bin/php /bin/php

would help.  Symbolic links should really clear things up, but take
note of some Apache and PHP settings about following symbolic links. 
Maybe a similar problem with httpd->apache, or maybe I'm way off.

Always dumps vendor provided configurations when he can,

Hans Z.

Hi All:

I am having a little problem:

I am trying to load a file's path from a DB and store
the record_id on an array. That way the next time the
function is called I don't get a repeated file into
the page. In other words, I'm trying to simulate
randomized links to be included on the page but, I
don't want it to repeat.


$path='NULL';
$text = array( 2, 3, 6, 9 );
$currentPath = 1;

//the function gets called from different places
several times like this: 
<tr>
<td><? get_file( $currentPath++ ); include($path); ?>
</td>
</tr>


function get_file($cur){
   global $path, $text;
   if( $cur == 1 )
    {
     $id = rand( 1, 10 );
     $sql = "select path from table where rec_id=$id";
     $result = runQuery( $sql );
     ..... database functions work .......
     $text[1]=$id;
     list( $path ) = mysql_fetch_array($result);
    }
   else
    {
     while( !checkId( $id=rand( 1, 10 ) ) )
      {
        $id = rand( 1, 10 );
     $sql = "select path from table where rec_id=$id";
     $result = runQuery( $sql );
     ..... database functions work .......
     $text[$cur]=$id;
     list( $path ) = mysql_fetch_array($result);
}
    }
}// endFunction

function checkId( $id )
{
  global $text;

   for($i=1; $i<5; $i++ )
   {
    if( $text[$i]==$id )
     print( 'Compared...' );
     return true;
   }
   return false;

}

Some how the print statement in the checkId() never
gets executed. I don't know why. What am I doing
wrong?

Please help.

Thanks.

Hmm... did you mean to have the the 'return true' within
the if test?  Basically, it's only doing one iteration of
the for loop and returning true.  Something like:

function checkId( $id )
{
  global $text;

   for($i=1; $i<5; $i++ )
   {
     if( $text[$i]==$id ) {     // missing brace
       print( 'Compared...' );
       return true;
     }                          // missing brace
   }
   return false;
}

This is the main reason I ALWAYS use {...} for if()'s, etc.
even if there is only one statement ;).

Don't know if this is what's causing your problem but it's
something that seemed contrary to intent.  Hope, this helps.

Plaster that code with print statements ala:
If ($debug) {
	print "ID: $id<br>";
	print "I: $i<br>";
	print "Text[$i]: $text[$i]";
	print "---<br>";
}

That's what I would do anyway.

Good luck.

In my original code the {} were in place. This is not
causing the problem..

Hmm... could you post your original code instead of the code

It's hard to make a diagnosis if they are different ;).

Here's the original code:

$text_path ='NULL';
$text = array( 0,0,0,0,0 );
$text_ads_count = 5
$current = 1;

This function will be called 4 or five times per page
like this:
<tr>
<td>
<?
	get_text_ad( $current++ );
	include( $text_path );
?>
</td>
</tr>


function get_random_number( $m, $l )

{	
	srand((double) microtime() * 1000000);

Ahh... I added a print statement:

  print "text[$i]: " . $text[$i] . "<br>";

BEFORE the if() test in the for loop... and found that
the if() test never passes since the $text[$cur] = $id;
assignment never occurs.  The checkit() function is called as:

  while(!checkit($id = get_random_number(1, $text_ads_count))){
    ...
  }

perhaps it should be called as:

  do {
   ...
  } while(!checkit($id = get_random_number(1, $text_ads_count)));

so that the $text[$cur] = $id; assignment occurs at least once
before the checkit() call.

Hope this helps and good luck!

Oh wait a minute!  I played with your code a little bit
more.  This time I used your code exactly, commenting
out any db-related statements and "running" it with:

  while ($current < 5) {
    get_text_ad( $current++ );
  }

and the print statement in checkit() works for me with your
original code.  Very strange!  Sorry, I'm at a loss as to
why it doesn't print for you.  Perhaps someone else on the
list will have more insight into this.

I fixed my problem. The while loop I had before was
messing things up. Here's the fixed problem:

$text_path ='NULL';
$text = array( 0,0,0,0,0 );
$text_ads_count = 5
$current = 1;

This function will be called 4 or five times per page
like this:
<tr>
<td>
<?
	get_text_ad( $current++ );
	include( $text_path );
?>
</td>
</tr>


function get_random_number( $m, $l )

{	
	srand((double) microtime() * 1000000);
	return rand( $m, $l );		
}
		

		
function get_text_ad( $cur ){
		
// declare global variables that will be used in the
function
		global $text;
		
		// declare local variable
		$useit = 'no';
		
		// set the current table to be used
		$table_name = 'ads_text';
		$update_field = 'presence';
		
		// if is the first ad displayed on the page; go
ahead and use it
		if( $cur == 1 )
		{   // set the id from a random generated number
			$id = get_random_number( 1,
$GLOBALS['text_ads_count'] );
			
			// Based on this number select the record from the
db
			$sql = "select path from $table_name where
ad_id=$id";
			
			$result = runQuery( $sql, "-- Select from
$table_name --"  );
			
			// set the path to the loaded path
			list( $GLOBALS['text_path'] ) = mysql_fetch_array(
$result );
			
			// set the current posistion in the array with the
selected id
			$text[$cur] = $id; 
					
			update_table( $table_name, $id, $update_field );			
		}// end if first occurrance
		else
		{
			while( $useit == 'no' ){
				$useit = checkit( $id = rand( 1,
$GLOBALS['text_ads_count'] ),
$GLOBALS['text_ads_count'] );

					// Based on this number select the record from

	function checkit( $randomnumber, $count ){
		// set local variables with global variables' data
		$t = $GLOBALS['text'];
			
		for( $i = 1; $i <= $count; $i++ )
		{
			if( $t[$i] == $randomnumber )
				return 'no'; // don't use the number/id
		}// end for loop
		return 'yes';	 // use the number/id
	}//end function checkit**********

Good job on fixing the problem. It seems, however, that you could simplify
this whole process by doing something like the following.


1) Grab all the data in random order like so...

    $query = mysql_query("SELECT path FROM ads_text ORDER BY RAND()");

2) Put it all in an array like so...

    while( $data = mysql_fetch_object($query)) {

        $paths[] = $data->path;

    }

3) Write a function get_next() that pulls  one out and deletes it from the
array...

    function get_next()
    {
        global $paths;
        $path = array_pop($paths);
        return $path;
    }

4) Then everytime you need it you write...

<td>
    <?
     include( get_next() );
    ?>
</td>

I need to find a fairly simple and customizable open-source message board
application written in PHP using either mySQL or flat files.

Using google and other web sources I have no problem finding hundreds, but
how does one sift through all the junk?

Can anyone recommend a good one?

Hello All,

	I am very new to this newsgroup, but figured I would share since I just
spent the night working on it... I just installed Phorum.  It runs on
Apache/MySQL/PHP infrastructures. The only complaint that I've seen (too new
to comment on actual usuage) is that a) the installation instructions are
lacking, and b) it can run slowing depending on the load.

	The application lives at www.phorum.org

-Enjoy,
Felix Marte

I have a problem with hotscripts.

Currently there are 125 scripts listed under "Discussion Boards." The system
allows for anyone to join and write reviews of their own products (or trash
other products). Anyone can post a script from first-time solo developer to
experienced team. All the scripts are essentially the same, but there is no
way to tell if a product is secure, tested, and stable. Just because some
developer says it's version 2.2.3b doesn't mean it wasn't put up last night.

I've also found intentional "bombs" and "black holes" in these scripts that
do nasty things.

Granted, most of the developers are probably ok, but how am I supposed to
know who is legit and who spent four hours last night "faking" it?

Phorum.org Hacked
Category: Web Site News????Written by brianlmoon at 8:23pm on May 19, 2002

Yes, the phorum.org server was hacked using the known and fixed security
bugs in Phorum 3.3.2a and before. The good news is that we did take some
precautions and all that could be done is to delete the files in the web
dir. The bad news is that the language files and our past poll results are
gone. The irony is that I had a script ready to go that would backup all
that stuff. I was waiting until tonight to put it in.

Current Phorum users should know that anybody should upgrade if at all
possible. If you used the secure script or followed the install instructions
to the letter, you are probably safe. All of the files used in this hack
would be protected by the .htaccess files that the secure script creates.

If you have a language file, please upload it.

Don't make it a bad forum :)

PS: please note that they were hacked using an exploit that was discovered and fixed at an earlier release. I don't know if this means that they've fixed the exploit after the hack or if they hadn't applied their own security fixes. I sure hope it's the prior.

I've had the same problem while looking for a decent Project Managememt / PIM application recently. Everything looks good on paper (so to speak), but when you actually download and give it a go, they all suck. Unfortunately, this is pretty much all you can do, download/install/test.  Your other option is to ask people whom you trust, for recommendations. You've done this already.

Too true.

Actually, it was this frustration that led me to NYPHP. Now at least I know
who and what I'm dealing with.

Thanks! Phorum is working out nicely.

Infopop is not freeware or opensource...and the last I checked, not written
in PHP either. I've been running a message board (wnymusic.com/board) for
about 6 years and started with Matt Wright's famous WWWBoard which was
really great at the time. I then switched to Infopop's UBB and actually paid
for a license but the whole thing was a monster and every thread was it's
own HTML file. That got real ugly after a while and started to break down
left and right.

I now use what I consider to be the best opensource message board out there:
phpBB version 1.4. They have since released version 2 which tries to keep up
with pay-for message boards like vBulletin which is also written in PHP and
is very good. Phorum is good but I don't care for the way the messages are
arranged.

You can get phpBB at http://www.phpbb.com

I concur with Jay - phpBB is good.  Which is probably why it is the #5 top 
download at SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/

But I need to use something that integrates with PostNuke, so I use XForum, 
which you can see in action at http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=XForum

Someone succeeded in integrating phpBB 2 with PHP-Nuke, but so far I think 
the highest version of phpBB that has been integrated with PostNuke is 1.4.

If you'd like to try out XForum, and have read any of William Gibson's 
works, feel free to join the William Gibson discussion:
