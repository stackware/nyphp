Subject: [nycphp-talk] Virtualbox as a dev environment
Message-ID: <4E61022C.9000005@gmail.com>

I've been driven a little crazy lately with trying to develop for Joomla 
with the following limitations:

1) Half the sites use PHP 5.2 and half of them use PHP 5.3
2) Sometimes I'm online and sometimes I'm offline


I kept coming back to "if only I was using linux, I could set things up 
more easily"....  Then it struck me that my desktop is a beefy system 
memorywise[this solution is gonna take a lot of memory] - so I gave 
VirtualBox a try.
http://www.virtualbox.org/

VirtualBox basically allows you to run different operating systems in a 
virtual environment.

For my current setup, I started with Ubuntu Server:
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/download

For the VirtualBox settings, choose fixed disk size - not dynamic.  I 
use 10GB, it eats up the full space but improves performance.  My system 
has 8GB of memory, so I give the system 2GB of ram, I'd suggest nothing 
under 1GB.

in the network settings for the virtual machine, I setup TWO network 
adapters.  Adapter 1 is set to "bridged adapter", the name is selected 
from my active adapter.   This allows the system to connect through 
yours to the internet.   Adapter 2 is a "Host Only Adapter"  - basically 
it's a "fake" network adapter that allows your pc communicate with the 
VM and the VM communicate with you.  So if your doing this on a laptop, 
you can still work even while offline.

****For the application settings[File-->Preferences] - go to the network 
settings and configure the virtual network adapter settings.  The 
important bit here is to disable the dhcp server.

When installing Ubuntu, setup adapter 1 for DHCP and adapter 2 as a 
static IP address in a different network[most home networks are 
192.168.1.0 or 192.168.2.0 - so I give my internal only network the 
address 192.168.129.1, netmask 255.255.255.0 - no default gateway!]

Openssh is important to install for decent CLI access.
Samba should be installed to make it easy to access the files on the 
server[just share out your web directory and then you can map the drive 
and access it from your favorite web editor].
Git, subversion, and mercurial should be installed since you need it at 
some point
I always make sure to install wget
Now, the piece of magic that makes this all work, DNSMasq:
http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html

DNSMasq allows you to run a DHCP server and  DNS cache on the virtual 
machine.  So you setup the DHCP server to give out an IP address to your 
system, and have it pass itself along as the DNS server[make VERY sure 
to also specify a blank gateway/router so all your internet traffic goes 
to the right place].
The importan bits I've found:
interface=eth1
interface=lo
^^^these 2 lines makes sure that your system doesn't try to take over 
your "real" network
address=/osm/192.168.56.1
domain=osm
^^^this sets up the "fake" domain osm and configures it so any domain 
ending in .osm will be given the ip address 192.168.56.1  - the virtual 
machines ip address
dhcp-range=192.168.56.10,192.168.56.15,255.255.255.0,12h
^^^ this gives your fake network a range of addresses, and a long timeout
dhcp-option=3
^^^ makes sure dnsmasq doesn't try to get your computer to route traffic 
through it
dhcp-option=19,0           # option ip-forwarding off
dhcp-option=44,192.168.56.1     # set netbios-over-TCP/IP nameserver(s) 
aka WINS server(s)
dhcp-option=45,192.168.56.1     # netbios datagram distribution server
dhcp-option=46,8           # netbios node type
^^^^helps with the file shareing
dhcp-authoritative
^^^speeds up initialization
cache-size=1500
no-negcache
^^^helps with lookups


As an added bennie, with dnsmasq running, your lame windows box now has 
the full power of a linux domain name caching - so it will speed up your 
general internet usage.

Then, in general, I follow the instructions at 
http://www.metod.si/multiple-php-versions-with-apache-2-fastcgi-phpfarm-on-ubuntu/ 
to setup and install apache, mysql, and php 5.2 and 5.3 - with 
modifications for the latest versions of each.

In my virtual hosts configuration the following are important:
VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%-3

%-3 basically means the third element of the domain name and is used to 
map domains to directories.  So for me:
http://testsite.53.osm - the files stored at /var/www/testsite - the 
THIRD element of the domain  name will be used
also using that directory is http://www.testsite.53.osm and 
http://testsite.52.home

Wheras http://mydomain.53.osm will use the files located at 
/var/www/mydomain

Our last bit of magic uses the virtual host configuration:
<VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerAdmin webmaster at localhost
         ServerName 52.osm
     ServerAlias *.52.osm
     VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%-3
         DocumentRoot /var/www
<Directory /var/www/>
                 Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews +ExecCGI
                 AllowOverride All
                 Order allow,deny
                 allow from all
                 AddHandler php-cgi .php
                 Action php-cgi /php-fcgi/php-cgi-5.2

</Directory>

<VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerAdmin webmaster at localhost
         ServerName 53.osm
     ServerAlias *.53.osm
     VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%-3
         DocumentRoot /var/www
<Directory /var/www/>
                 Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews +ExecCGI
                 AllowOverride All
                 Order allow,deny
                 allow from all
                 AddHandler php-cgi .php
                 Action php-cgi /php-fcgi/php-cgi-5.3

</Directory>


These 2 configurations are almost identical, the only things that change 
are servername, serveralias, and action
The servername has to be a full name, so I just use the php version I 
want with the domain tacked on[53.osm].
The serveralias can have a wildcard, so *.53.osm means that for ANY 
website you try to load which ends in .53.osm use this configuration.
Lastly, the Action line tells apache which PHP FastCGI server to route 
the request to.  So I have 2 different instances of PHP running, 5.2 and 
5.3 and route accordingly.

[Note, I share out the /var/www directory using SAMBA, and then map it 
on my windows box to drive letter W:]

So now to edit files on my test website, garyamort, I edit the files 
located at w:/garyamort
To see the website using PHP 5.2, I go to http://garyamort.52.osm
To see the website using PHP 5.3 I go to http://garyamort.53.osm

When dealing with oddities like a website which "suddenly" stops 
working, one cause is upgrading to PHP 5.3
CiviCRM for example has 2 versions, almost identical but one of them 
will run on PHP 5.2 and one runs on PHP 5.3  - so a CiviCRM website that 
suddenly stops working is likely to have a webhost who upgraded PHP from 
5.2 to 5.3

It's a fairly simple solution - just copy the 5.3 version files over the 
old version files AND DELETE THE TEMPLATE CACHE DIRECTORIES - and it 
will start working again.

If there is interest, I'm trying to put together a virtual box of all 
this pre-configured, so all you have to do is - with the exception of 
the part I put *** in front of, it would all be plug and play for most 
home networks.

By the same token, if anyone knows a bit more about DHCP and DNS - I've 
had trouble with this part with windows...since both the home router and 
my virtual box broadcast a DNS server address, Windows will 
occassionally grab the wrong DNS address.  The problem is, I don't want 
to ALWAYS run the virtualbox, so I want some way for the VM to override 
the DNS address, but still allow the client to use the other one.

And for those of you who are really good with IPForwarding, I sometimes 
have to use remove VPN networks.  So I have the VPN client on both my 
windows machine and the virtual machine running.  It would be great if I 
could get the VPN client on the linux machine to dynamically update 
dnsmasq so that when it's running, the DHCP server will tell my windows 
box to route all traffic just for the remote network through it, and do 
some NAT routing on the virtualbox so the connection goes through there.

Interesting, what about performances? I guess is useful only for testing
right?

I switched to a similar rig after updating to a new laptop with faster
CPU and more RAM. I see no performance hit from the guest OS, and I
get to work on a "real" server even when there is no internet.

One thing that you might consider adding to the guest OS is Samba so
you can share the web directories out to your host OS and work on the
files directly.

What's your thought on using XAMPP instead of creating a bunch of 
virtual machines? You could run two instances of apache (php ver 5.2 & 
5.3) on different ports and have both reference the same web directory 
and mysql.  I have found XAMPP to be slow (umm, my laptop is a Dell D410 
Pentium Mobile with 1GB RAM) but it's probably not as taxing on the 
resources as booting up two whole virtual Linux OS's within a Windows OS.

I tried setting up XAMP and MAMP with multiple PHP versions and it was a 
nightmare because they load some DLL's for PHP that can only be loaded once.

Separate directories didn't work too well either because of registry 
settings.  And running both simultaneously dragged down the entire system.

Note, I don't have 2 virtual machines.  I use one virtual machine 
configured to use fastCGI for PHP so I can use 3 different versions of 
PHP at the same time[5.2, 5.3, 5.4].

It is the virtual machine definition, which is based on the domain name 
of the url, which determines which fastcgi server to use.  If I go to 
http://mytest.53.osm it will use PHP 5.3, if I go to 
http://mytest.52.osm it will use 5.2

The real beauty, for me, is that it uses the same directory for either 
PHP version.  They both read from the /var/www/mytest directory, it is 
just the PHP interpreter that is different.  [in fact, one thing I'm 
thinking of doing is to setup some additional sub-options, basically run 
3 or 4 fastcgi servers for PHP 5.3,
mydomain.53.osm - straight PHP 5.3, display errors disabled
mydomain.53e.osm - same PHP executable, different php.ini to enable 
display errors but don't show me notices, strict, or depreicated.
mydomain.53s.osm - same PHP executable, different php.ini to show strict 
and deprecated
mydomain.53a.osm - same PHP executable, different ini, show me all the 
errors

As for speed, it is DAMN fast.  Giving it 2G of memory is probably 
overkill. :-)  And when the hurricane came through and I lost internet, 
everything was sitting on my local system with the same linux config 
from the server.

XAMPP isn't ideal because it doesn't give you a server environment.
There are a lot of subtle (and not so subtle) things that change when
you move from one environment to another.

Developing against a virtual machine with the same configuration as
your production server gives you a lot more confidence that your code
will work as intended in production.

I've been using VMware Server (free as in beer) to run Ubuntu VMs on my 
laptops for 1+ years. Works great for me.

I have one VM for dev work, and another for staging, which is set up 
like production. Easy to create a fresh one to test restoration of backups.

My previous laptop with 3GB of RAM could barely run dev (1GB) and 
staging (512MB) together, plus some essential apps like Thunderbird, 
browser, IDE. Which is pretty good, I think. I have a new Sandy Bridge 
laptop (Latitude, i5-2520M) with 4GB, and all is good now.

The admin interface is a little slow, but the VM itself is quite fast IMO.

You can set up the networking to bridge to the host OS's connection, or 
to use a NAT subnet within the workstation. That is, your host 
workstation can communicate with the VM, but other machines cannot. I'm 
not a network guy, so sorry if my explanation is rubbish :)

Kind of points to Windows being a poor environment for this kind of 
development, no?

BTW is this virtualization new to you guys? I was running VirtualBox back 
in 2006...

I used to use VMWare Server as well, but found the performance to be dismal.

I agree, the admin UI is a total dog, but the VMs are not too shabby, but 
compared to VMWare Player it is rather slow.

VMWare Player used to be just that, a tool to play VMs. But while VMWare 
Server is no longer maintained a lot of changes were made to VMWare Player, 
including the option to create new VMs.

Also, if there is a box available that can be dedicated to VMs then ESX and 
Xen as well as Linux KVM are options.

As far as VirtualBox is concerned, I found it to be extremely crash happy.

I've been using Centos Xen VM's on a dedicated development machine and 
it's been working well without any problems. When I'm done with the 
client's job, just shut down the instance and store away the disk image 
on a backup. Didn't do any good when we lost power for half a day after 
the hurricane though.

Nope, makes perfect sense.  Question: can you do both?

That's how I have my virtualBox setup.  It gets 2 adapters.  Adapter 1 
is a bridge to the host OS's connection - and I don't run any servers on 
that interface.  Adapter 2 is an internal adapter is an internal only 
virtual network.  My host system has a virtual adapter connected to it, 
and every VM I run will also get a virtual adapter connected to it.

Mainly this means I can have everything up and running regardless of the 
status of my "real" network as my virtual network is always running.

It's fairly new for me.  I've never had a system fast enough to really 
run it, and never felt like I needed it.

Late last year when my laptop died, I decided I was doing most of my 
work from one place anyway, and I was playing around a lot with EC2, so 
I wanted a way to simulate a cloud at home without having to connect to 
the outside world or pay their fees.  So I decided to get a desktop for 
the same money as a laptop, but make sure to get lots of hard drive 
space, memory, and 6 core CPU....

Original plan had been to put KVM on it and load windows into a Virtual 
OS...   But the windows install disks that came with it won't install to 
anything but this hardware, so I'm going the other way[VirtualBox on 
Windows].

Still, I didn't want 6 different VM systems for each config, so being 
able to boil it all down to one system with virtual hosting makes my 
life sooo easy.   And being able to use the linux box as a DNS 
server/cache speeds up regular internet usage tremendously.

Funny, I was looking into doing this today at my workplace. I was  
considering VMware but the player doesn't seem to support macs and we  
have developers on Win,Linux and Mac. I looked into paralells but the  
mac performace isn't great  in my experience. Also, I'd like to  
package the same server image for all the devs. Has anyone had any  
experience doing this on a mac with virtualbox? Or Any orther  
vitualization that will run acceptably cross platform?

Hi guys,

I recently experienced an issue with the image resizing on the fly with GD
library of PHP.

I draw the image with:
header('Content-type :image/jpeg');
header('Content-Length: ' . filesize( $image ) );
$file = file_get_contents( $image );
echo $file;
it works when the image is already cached, when I've to create the image,
sometimes PHP change my header to Content-type: text/html, so the image
won't load, and I'll get instead a list of Ascii.

I fixed partially with a workaround, before do the *echo $file;* I check the
headers, if they are changed, I remove all of them and set again, also this
solution doesn't work always, I also tried to set header( "location: - same
location -" ); this works sometimes, because the cache is already created
but when there's many images sometimes the browser won't reindex it and give
again a blank image.

Do you have any idea of why does it?

If any of the following causes an error and display_errors == 1, you'll get
output and  PHP will default to text/html:

header('Content-type :image/jpeg');
header('Content-Length: ' . filesize( $image ) );
$file = file_get_contents( $image );

If you have any whitespace prior to header(), you'll get output and PHP will
default to text/html.

You can avoid whitespace by never using an ending ?> tag.

True that, but the error happen randomly, the same image sometimes works
sometimes no, so I think it might be some GD library bug

make sure that there is no whitespace between the colon and the header name,
so

header('Content-type :image/jpeg');

must become

header('Content-type: image/jpeg');

I am not sure how sensitive the browsers are to this, but that's how it
should be formatted according to the HTTP spec.

Additionally, make sure that your image is really and jpeg as if your file
contents was for example PNG or GIF,
the browser would try to process it as a JPEG

There is always Imagine image manupulation library to help you with your
resizing needs - https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine

Best,

Maybe try output buffering? Something is generating an error then...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Running multiple mod_php extensions
Message-ID: <4E67A8F0.3050708@gmail.com>

One problem I've run into with using FastCGI for multiple PHP versions 
is that a number of open source projects depend on mod_php - and while 
it is possible to reconfigure fastcgi to provide the information that 
mod_php provided[for example, the script_name defaults to the script 
name of the fastcgi script, not the program being used], I really hate 
debugging that stuff.

Looking at the ApacheHandler extension, it first seemed like it should 
be simple to change all occurences of the handler label mod_php to 
create multiple custom modules.  IE mod_php_5_3_6 and mod_php_5_3_8... 
then both modules can be loaded and the handler assigned in the virtual 
host.

This worked fine for assigning a custom handler function, but even with 
that if I load both handlers, Apache locks up.  My guess is that the 
other extern declarations also need to have a custom declaration.

I was wondering if anyone else has done this before and if so what your 
experience was?

-Gary

Checked the spacing and try the output buffering, the problem of the header
is into PHP, is not the browser that change the headers.
The weirdest thing is that the script works fine, but randomly doesn't,
that's why I can't really reproduce the problem, but I've to wait that
happen, I might send you the source of it

Thanks

Hi Frederico:

Add an error handler (http://php.net/set_error_handler) that gathers
the problem information and the images and sets them (and sends an email
to you if you want).  It's possible there are some images that have
parameters you're not properly accounting for.

Good luck,

Hi Gary:

For a while I was running two different versions of PHP on two different
ports (80 and 8080 for example).  That was a _while_ ago (when PHP 5 was
in alpha mode) on Windows.  PHP 4 was on one port and PHP 5 on another.

Stop trying to load both handlers in the same Apache process?

You can specify the config file location on the command line as you
start httpd. So use two (or more!) different configs that listen on
different port numbers or virtual hostnames. Viola, different Apaches,
each with its own version of php.

This may be controversial but I would like to know what the conceived top 5 PHP frameworks are. You don't have to list why, just an order from most popular, i.e. there is more demand for developers with experience using the framework. The reason I ask, is I have just spent a year working with CakePhp, which has it's benefits, but I have also seem some flaws with it. So when I'm ready to move on, I would like to go in the direction of flow in the industry.

every framework will have "flaws" that are unique to what you're trying to do.  you should try to find one that is small and extensible enough that you can customize.

here are some of the ones ive seen (in no particular order):
zend
symfony
code igniter (php < 4), kohana (php 5+)
yii

-d

From what I've seen around the community, the most popular seem to be

Zend
Symfony
Cake
CodeIgniter

I've also seen a number of people using Yii/Prado as well as Vork.

Personally, I'm using Lithium.

What's the best framework is one of the hot discussion on linked in.
Ruby has Rails, PHP has many, Symfony2 it's a good one, mostly used in
Europe, the community is nice, but the founder Fabien Potencier is not
very friendly, before come to NYC, at the Italian PHP Day I asked him
if they was hiring, he's answer was "we hire only people who speak
French" ...

Kohana is based on Code Igniter, a good choice but the community is
way smaller than Code Igniter, here in NYC many agencies goes for Yii,
Zend is one of the best solution, hope the PHP 5 version will improve
the performances, which were the biggest issue of it.

Keep in consideration also to use a CMF like Drupal, one of the best
solution, many NYC agencies chose it, so is also a good skill to add
in your resume, if you're searching for job.

As last, I'd like to mention the RainFramework, it's easy, lightweight
and fast, so if you searching for great performances it's worth a try

A lean & mean AJAX-specific framework is SlimPHP.  I've used it and can 
say that I was happy with it.

The "big 5" are clearly:  CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Drupal, Zend & Symfony.  
Maybe some agencies in NYC are using Yii but in all my years I've never 
run into one.

I think that it's a good idea to get experience using as many different 
frameworks as you can so you become comfortable with MVC architectures 
in general, and know what the plusses/minuses are in different 
situations.  In many cases the people doing the hiring are narrow 
thinkers who only want to hire someone with experience in "that specific 
framework" when the truth is, after a few years, they all start to seem 
pretty similar.

It's best to stick whenever possible with the less bloated options, like 
Kohana, where performance issues are the primary consideration; although 
yes, there is little or no documentation available for Kohana.  In fact 
I will be using Kohana for an upcoming project due to its leanness.

I've dealt extensively with reengineering really horribly designed 
CakePHP codebases and it's amazing what I've seen.  It was clearly 
advertised as a quick, easy way to hire really green programmers to 
build "complex" websites.  It's not.

The framework choice is always less important than having a 
well-designed database underlying your code.

Happy coding,

Kristina

One could argue, that there's no replacement for sound engineering and 
that the greatest framework is your own brain.

Its important not to get caught up in any hype surrounding one tool 
or another. There's that (now classic) post from the CD Baby guy who was 
all set to jump into Rails but ultimately rewrote his own PHP framework 
instead.

As he says in the post: "But the main reason that any programmer learning 
any new language thinks the new language is SO much better than the old 
one is because he's a better programmer now!"

+1...for that AJ

But if you are going to use someone else's code. make sure. Make for
damn sure... it has a wealth of CURRENT documentation and a lively
community.

My mantra... (a.k.a. rant)

I don't use software that tries to solve all problems. The worst
software grows out of goal-less development. Look for something with
clear, concise, decisive design decisions. The *nix moto... do one
thing and do it right. LESS CODE IS BETTER! A good example that will
hit close to home for some and I hope won't start a flame war is
Drupal. Until recently it was a bloated mess. It has started to clean
up it's act come version 7 but in my opinion it still does WAY too
much for it's own good.

I don't use software if the documentation is not up to snuff. Don't
take api/(insert language here)doc as enough. When you are getting up
to speed in a new technology you need much more handholding or face
hair loss. You need cookbooks, working examples, CURRENT api and
method signatures. etc.

I dont use software if it hasn't already been put into production some
very visible places. Use something you know works. Why be the first on
the block to see if X scales? You know how I know what scales. I have
seen larger stacks use it in the past. Safe bets are best.

I dont use software if it hasn't had at least 2 minor releases. Unless
you need a specific feature of a bleeding edge release just use what
you know will work! How do you know... because it's been around for a
while and people have used it and tested it.

I dont use software if it has no community involvement. (Don't
underestimate other peoples schedules... think about how busy you get
during your average work year. You may just have a project dropped
from under you. One core developer on an open source project is not
enough to bet the house on.)

I prefer my software to come with unit/functional tests. If nothing
else they can be used as examples. But the piece of mind you get as a
developer if you know what you are using has been tested thoroughly is
worth more than the most amazing untested functionality you can dream
of. Just think of all the times you banged your head on your desk
trying to figure out why something isn't doing what the documentation
said it was supposed to do. Only to find out yes... it is a bug in the
library you are using!

I hate using software. Less is better period. If you can get away
without using an extra daemon then do it. Don't add 5 more caching
layers and 3 more database abstractions just because they are the new
cool acronyms. It's only going to make your code less maintainable.
Over architecting and early optimization are what keep projects from
ever getting to launch.

The same thing goes for languages. Don't write your services in more
than 1 language if you can avoid it. If you are writing webapps from
the ground up limit yourself to one backend and one frontend language.

Don't add caching until you need it! The same thing goes for sharding
of your database schemas! KISS... across your entire stack. Not just
your code.

Whew... sorry about that. Back to the topic at hand.

Symfony 1.X is probably still more widely used than Symfony 2.x and
both are good. Although 2.x is a far more abstracted and multipurpose
framework 1.x is still great for the usual 3 tier webapps. Both are
very well documented.

CodeIgniter is a really great lightweight framework. If you are
looking for something straight forward, well documented and full of
examples this is also a good choice.

Zend had so much steam early on and then where did it go? I feel like
they have been sleeping.

Yii has been around for a while and same with Kohana but both have
less numbers than the above.

I have to revisit cake. I haven't used it in a while but for a while
it was seriously suffering on the documentation front.

If I was to pick a framework to run with on a new project I would
probably pick Symfony 2 because of it's forward thinking architecture.
It can seem overly complex so be warned. If you haven't already heard
of things like dependency injection or service containers you may feel
a little lost. The good thing is that there is a bunch of
documentation to get you up to speed. Also it makes use of useful
things like ESI and... HTTP... who knew!

Cheers,
Jesse

Its interesting to read about how componentized Symfony 2.x is - Drupal 
are planning to use some of the components in a future release.

Or just pick one or two components out of Symfony 2.x and build your 
apps around it...

a small bench, anyway I agree, a good designed DB is more important,
also performance thanks to the edge caching (squid, varnish ...) and
browser caching are no more a critical issue

If you have to change framework for your new projects keep also in
consideration Ruby, clean and awesome!

I think some of these comparisons are kind of useless. Lightweight 
frameworks are light because they might have fewer features, less 
flexibility, etc etc. In some cases, you may end up writing more 
application code to make up for a light framework (which also means the 
framework of choice is not matched to your problem domain very well).

DB, I/O and streaming are the bottle neck, that's why that benchmark is not
very useful, the reason why I posted it is because there are mentioned a few
framework, which are the same we're mentioning in this emails, and if you
search on Google you'll find many more article that will tell you to use
Code Igniter, Cake, Symfony, Zend, Yii...

In that list they are all good, so just give a look to them and chose your
favorite.

Quite the opposite. Zend Framework started accepting contributions
from anyone and everyone and now, even though they have done a good
job of minimizing dependencies between modules, there is a lot of crap
in ZF. I also think most of these "frameworks" are just bloated.
Maintainers really need to understand how to suppress feature-creep
already. Or better still just give each contributor their own branch
and encourage people to steal from each other. That way the good stuff
will make it into trunk, the crap won't and the unused stuff will be
removed.

Hi there:

I'm strongly considering migrating some future projects to MODX Revolution. It sort of sits in that space between a low-level framework, and something 'polished' and not-as-easily-extensible like ExpressionEngine. It tries to do core functionality + content management, but not output, which is what hits the sweet spot for at least some of our work.

http://modx.com/

Sorry, it's not 5?and as for 'popular', I'm not sure if it will help from the standpoint of marketing your services.

Cheers,
Marc

Have you guys checked out PhpBURN?

It have a REALLY strong and powerfull ORM/DATAMAPPER/DAO it's model layer is
very powerful with some cool features such as:

* Relationships ( with clauses... it means you can put limit, order, where,
like and other things into relationships call before call them to avoid
unecessary data and server load )
* Vertical relationships ( a Model can extends another working as only one
but having different tables transparently to the developer )
* Relationship between differente databases and DBMS ( you can extend or
have a relationship between a mysql and a mssql for exaple or vice versa )
* Easy to learn and very plug and play.

If you guys want i can talk about it a little and i'm avaliable to help .

But also because it looks like their configurations weren't optimized in

Of course, Zend is really just a library...

Or you componentize and make it easy to switch off or remove uneeded 
components (a la Symfony2).

I've used Modx on a few projects and have had no complaints.. simple to use
gives my clients a simple way to edit their website, so it has worked out
for me so far.

Why would you consider Drupal a framework rather than a CMS?

For that matter, how would you define "framework?"

You're better off asking one of the following questions:

 * What are the top five PHP 5.3 frameworks?
 * What are the top five PHP 5 frameworks?

Because it's really hard to compare current-gen frameworks with
last-gen frameworks.

Additionally, "most common" doesn't mean "awesomest" or "easiest to
use" or even "what a reasonable person would choose to start their
*next* project with".

I'm trying to require users to input proper names with capitalization that
conforms to convention. So, you can't go e. e. cummings on me, and you can't
be JOHN SOMEBODY either. And you can't have your caps lock on and enter jOHN
sOMEBODY. That much is pretty easy, but I am finding the more subtle cases
pretty hard.

So far, I have

        /\b[a-z][A-Z]+|\b[A-Z]{2,}+|^[a-z ]+$/

to test against (false is good). This works on all the cases I have tested
except "cuMmings," which gets by. But I am thinking, maybe enough is enough;
you can't control everything.

Just wondering if anyone has tackled this before or has any thoughts.

btw this is on top of other whitelist-style validation.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Hi Everyone,

So I've been learning a bit of Python and I already know Perl. One of
the strongest non-language related aspects of both languages is that
they both have a strong and active foundation behind them working
towards furthering adoption and acceptance of the languages within the
enterprise and other sectors.

PHP has Zend.

While I understand that Zend does an amazing job developing PHP and
solutions around the language, I'm wondering why there is no
non-profit foundation working to further the goals of the language in
non-commercial ways. Personally, I think being backed by a non-profit
interest could really benefit PHP and I'm wondering what everyone
else's thoughts on the topic are.

Thoughts? Flames?

Thanks,
Anthony

This is my pain with trying to learn symfony2 this week. I'm trying some 
stuff out, and just find myself repeatedly coming to a point and 
thinking, "okay, now what the heck am I supposed to do to achieve X?" 
Not so symfony1... not sure if it has better documentation or just b/c 
of the years of experience I have with it, but symfony1 seemed much more 
transparent, in a good way. The vertical Askeet/Jobeet tutorials were of 
course a big help. Actually I remember that the major changes for 1.2 
threw me off, but nothing as bad as this.

My main problem is divesting myself of the assumptions of the framework. 
Kohana was perfect for this; I had a weird, weird backend from a Perl 
application, for which I crafted a Kohana front-end; it was perfectly 
flexible, and the 2.3-something documentation was at least adequate.

Then their community welched on the 2.4 release they'd been promising, 
and lost my trust. :(  Goes to show how important community is, to me 
anyway.

Haven't looked at CI in years, maybe time for a revisit. The whole 
let's-hug-PHP4 thing they had going at the time was a huge turnoff for me.

The subtle cases exist more often than you think. Just ask Sarah
O'Malley-van Dorf.

I know, you know that, and it seems right to normalize. But it's so
much easier to just let people spell their own names however they want
to.

Interesting, thanks.

As it happens, the last, middle and first names are separate fields.
(Actually I am labelling them "surname(s)" and "given name(s)" just to keep
it confusing.)

btw McDonald and its brethren pass the test I've written. But so does
McdoNald, which is why I am thinking, ok, you are only so clever and if they
want to input data that is wrong in some way or other, at some point you
can't stop 'em. You did your due diligence.

PHP is a totally anarchical language, where classes, functions, and
different coding style are mixed together, so we have subStr and file_size.
PHP has a weak presentation layer, so there are tons of approach and
template engines to manage presentation. Also terms as MVC are used
differently by their real meaning
(http://devzone.zend.com/article/12997<http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdevzone%2Ezend%2Ecom%2Farticle%2F12997&urlhash=OY3b&_t=tracking_disc>
).

PHP is mature enough to have some organization as the W3G for HTML, that
should give some specification to follow like HTML4.1 , HTML 5. I wish PHP 6
could re-write all the functions and class with a single style, and a common
design pattern, a better presentation layer.

But who's going to take this responsability?  As you well said, Anthony,
Zend is a profit company we need some open source organization. I'm not the
best person to do it, but I've some good idea to start something, why we
don't talk about it somewhere with a good beer?

LOL. Disclosure:  I didn't read your link yet. But here's the thing, this
isn't for people to enter their own names, but someone else's:  the names of
defendants who require interpreters in criminal cases in federal court. Even
the anglo idea of "first" and "last" names breaks down when you run up
against cultures where last is first and vice-versa, meaning "last" and
"first" is the wrong way to think about it.

Accurately typing strange names in strange languages is so hard, it's no
wonder there was once a study that found that 80% of the files in the US
Immigration service had errors of one sort or another.

A little OT digression about the hyphen. Many of you know that in the
Spanish-speaking world people conventionally use two surnames, the paternal
and maternal, in that order. Try explaining that to US law enforcement and
corrections:  they can't get their minds around it. So everyone has to get
hyphenated. Makes me crazy. But there are occasional legitimate hyphen-jobs
as well, so.... let it go, or talk to your therapist about it.

Or the opposite problem: I've been working with a city-run database
that doesn't allow hyphens in names. Brilliant!

Hey Everyone,

So I've never used MCRYPT before today and I've got a question. How
can I tell if it's worked or failed? The doc says MCRYPT_DECRYPT() and
MCRYPT_ENCRYPT() will return decrypted or encrypted data respectively
but how do I know if it's completely failed?

Thanks!
Anthony

I think the best way is to keep it open, so what about this:
(\w(\s|\'|\-){0,1})*

Also how do you validate Chinese, Japanese, Hindy, Arab and others languages
name?

If it failed you get binary gibberish, or nothing, and you get to
troubleshoot till you figure out the problem.

It's not very dev friendly, but it works.

The question is does PHP need that non-profit when anarchy has served it
well? Who would serve in the organization? The key contributors? Its to late
for anyone to own the copyright to PHP and make all contributors sign
copyright over to them. What exactly would this body do?

As far as advocating PHP in the enterprise, I think Zend, IBM and Jetbrains
do fantastic jobs of that. Why do we need a non-profit to cater to
for-profits?

I agree that Zend has been a pretty good steward of PHP.

But Java folks said that about Sun, and look where they are now.
Companies (and their IP) get bought and sold. Putting PHP in the hands
of a foundation would help insulate us from the eventual
sale/merger/acquisition/bankruptcy/profit-motives of Zend. It's not
something that needs to happen, but it's worth thinking about, if for
no other reason then to prevent a bunch of different, incompatible
forks of PHP if Zend ever goes dark.

Once upon a time, I had students writing a Name class do all sorts of funky
validation and auto-correction, even checking for "Mc", "Mac", "De", and
"de" specifically.  It's an awful chore, and it seemed like every semester
someone thought of a valid name that my hardcore regex missed.  Now I use
different examples altogether.  :)

That would be "Hindi" but there's no upper or lower case letters in the Hindu alphabet :-)

I don't think there is a clear copyright owner for PHP. When I made my tiny
contribution (possibly to tiny to legally copyright) to PHP I never had to
sign away copyright to anyone and I never heard of anyone signing a
copyright assignment document (unlike mongodb and sharpdevelop). If Zend
ever went dark I'd expect Microsoft and IBM and the other big corporate
stakeholders to actually play nice with each other. The community
contributors will keep on keeping on.

The open office foundation did not stop the forking of Libre/Open office. It
didn't even stop the NeoOffice fork (who I've actually given money to) from
happening.

Tell me about it.

Many years ago I started a company in Michigan named "?.com".

I don't know if the BULLET character will make it through your email program, but it's a legitimate character none the less. I even had/have a web site for the name for over ten years, namely: http://xn--nvg.com (<-- note this URL is PUNYCODE).

On Windows Machines, the URL will how up as PUNYCODE, but for Mac Machines running Safari, you will see a BULLET dot com in the address bar.

In any event, when I printed the name of the Michigan State's DBA registration, it printed well enough via my Mac. But when the Michigan Secretary of State tried to enter the name into their database, they did not know how to enter a BULLET on their Windows machines. So, I showed them that if the typed 0149 with the ALT key a BULLET would be produced. So, I was able to get the name into their machines.

But they didn't like it because it was different. However, I insisted that the character was a legitimate character and that's what I wanted for my company name. So my request rattled all the way up to THE Secretary of State who ruled that all Michigan companies names must be ASCII only. That is the rule now.

So, if you want to start a Business in Michigan, you must use a name that only contains ASCII characters. No foreign characters allowed here! As always, the government knows best. :-)

Cheers,

tedd

It's for sale:
http://symboldomains.com/symbol-domains-for-sale.html

I note that on Win7+FF and Win7+Chrome, none of those domains appear in 
the address bar; they've all been punycoded.

Damn, if I still used Macsyma, I'd want  http://xn--d9g.com.
(And yes, I got  xn--3-6mb.com for my company.)

jerry:

How do I deal with the PUNYCODE problem? I live with it hoping that someday M$ (and others) will find a solution to the homographic problem that they envision by showing PUNYCODE instead of showing what the IDNS WG wanted.

Tried this with FF7 and IE9 and IETab in FF7. The only one that gets it 
straight is IETab...kinda funny.

Then again, who wants such a URL for a business anyway? Nobody can type that 
letter on their keyboard and the punycode equivalent isn't really easy to 
remember or meaningful. Yes, it makes the geek in me smile, but I hardly see 
any practical purpose for this.

It is designed for people coming from other languages.  Like groupon
in china is gaopeng.com, but gaopeng is ?? when written as characters.
  ??.com is http://xn--bpvz66i.com/ in puny code.

The problem with puny code is that it is a security nightmare, and no
safe browsers are ever going to support it.

Can you find the difference between http://paypal.com/ and
http://paypa?.com/ ?

The EV SSL certificate?

I don't know, there IS a security concern here, but the ASCII
requirement is a really big f**k you to the billions of people around
the world who use non-western character sets.

You think it's hard for you to type a bullet character on your
keyboard? Try typing "php.ru" on a Cyrillic keyboard.

The l in the second paypal is actually a ? which is an l with a dot
under it.  I could buy that domain and a SSL cert for it, then do a
bunch of fishing attacks and no one would notice the tiny dot in
paypa?.

John:

You got the obvious right, but that's the problem.

According to any computer I use, there is a difference between code-points regardless of what they look like. Just because you can find two, or more, code-points that look alike does not mean that computers can be fooled. Code-points are different by definition.

The problem arises when Browsers show code-points but do not also indicate to the user that these code-points are from different language/character sets. This could be easily solved by simply coloring the url. This was suggested/discussed in the IDNS WG back in 2000, but was not considered by Browser makers.

For example, the paypal.com problem you described could be easily solved by simply coloring a mixed char-set URL. Would you give personal information to a URL if the URL was colored red or blinking red? I think not.

On the other hand, keep in mind that only three precent of the world's population has English as their native language. So, the question really becomes, is PUNYCODE the answer for everyone? It was never intended by the IDNS WG for the end-user to ever see it -- this decision was made by the Browser makers, not users.

Consider that when the rest of the world logs on to the Internet and starts demanding that they be able to use their own native language, you will see Browser makers either consider how to fix this problem -- OR -- find themselves in the position that M$ is now in because of their head-fast insistence of ignoring W3C standards and as a result being surpassed by other Browser makers.

As M$ found out, you can't stop progress regardless of what marketshare you have.

This is a problem, but not an unsolvable one. Browsers will support PUNYCODE AND be safe eventually.

Cheers,

tedd

David:

In addition to all that was said about other Languages/Customs having access to the Internet in their own native Languages, let me add there ARE symbols in the English Language. We commonly use math symbols, dingbat characters, grammar, and other such symbols in our English language, right? 

In addition, these symbols are on your keyboard, or can be accessed by your keyboard. Just because the Windows environment makes it hard to type a BULLET for example, (ALT 0149), it is really a simple thing to do on a Macintosh -- it's just option 8 -- one character. The world no longer revolves around M$.

As such, in the Safari Browser I can type an option 8 in the address bar and go directly to: http://xn--nvg.com the URL will show ?.com.

Another example, if a Macintosh user types option v into the Safari Browser address bar they will go to ?.com (square-root dot com), namely http://xn--nvg.com. Incidentally, that site receives over 200 unique Mac users per day and that rate is rising.

So, your questions as to "who wants such an URL for business anyway?", let me reply if your customers could remember your site by simply typing a single character into their address bar, would that sound like a good thing to you? Especially if you were selling a Mac product? 

Keep in mind that while single character domains are not available, it has been speculated that they would run into the millions of dollars for each if they were. So, what's the value of a single character domain? In that regard, this makes a good read:

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/28/tech/main1080245.shtml

In addition, these domains can be combined with other domains so that IF the user was on a Windows machine, they would go to one site and if they were on a Safari browser they could go to the url that would show the domain as a symbol. It is simply a redirect and a marketing consideration.

In any event, considering I've been developing software for Apple computers for over three decades now, I'm considering using option v (square-root) OR option 8 (BULLET) as a site to sell my software.

I think it's a neat idea, but I've failed before.  :-)

Cheers,

tedd

Disclaimer: The following may/may not be true.

And in my opinion PayPal would sue you out of existence, as I believe they did with the person who created the first homographic attack example.

However, the above statement might be stuff of an urban myth, so I am neither confirming/nor denying the truth of this incident if it did occur, or not.

However, I will say that discussing this incident (if it occurred, or not) is serious stuff. Thread carefully.

Cheers,

You are right, that it is more complicated than I initially mentioned,
however, chromium has pretty much decided already which way they are
going to go.  Don't hold your breath waiting for ?.com to be
supported, because in the design documents it is something they won't
fix.   There is a nice summary at the bottom, and you will see that
Google has chosen to go the same route as Microsoft.  My guess is that
Safari will become more secure like Chrome/IE/Firefox, not the other
way around.

see:

And these days, you can even forge an SSL cert says you're the real
Paypal and/or use newly worked out TLS attacks to man-in-the-middle
secure sessions.

Who knows?

I know that the majority of Apple's profit came from overseas last year and a few weeks ago they surpassed Exxon as the richest company on the planet -- in other words, Apple won.

Now what Apple does is really up to Apple. I'm guessing they won't follow the heard. And why should they? They made their fortune by leading not following.

Yes, but are those characters a wise choice for an easy to remember URL? I get 
the Chinese characters and that it matters to Chinese speaking people, but for 
a US business to use a URL of ??.com does not make much sense. Yes, it may be 
technically possible and a perfectly valid URL, but aside from a handful of 
geeks you won't find anyone who knows how to enter these characters.

I could make the same complaint. How come that I cannot type easily ?? on a US 
keyboard, but it is a piece of cake on a German layout keyboard. Why does the 
world solely revolve around the US? That is even more the point for cyrillic 
or chinese characters.

So how many unique users would it get when it was called squareroot.com? I bet 
it would be noticeably more. Mac and Safari users exist in negligible numbers. 
And I use Safari myself and part time a Mac at work, so it isn't that I diss 
the Apple products in any way.

> So, your questions as to "who wants such an URL for business anyway?", let me reply if your customers could remember your site by simply typing a single character into their address bar, would that sound like a good thing to you? Especially if you were selling a Mac product?

It would be a good idea if I sell a Mac product, but the vast majority of the 
computing industry does not come across Macs or Safari, they are still a niche 
product. I'm not dissing the products, but the user base is negligible for 
general purposes. Apple excels more with consumer devices, such as MP3 players 
and phones and tablets. Those all have no keyboards. I never used an 
iPad/iPhone (way too expensive for me), so not sure how the text entry works 
on those, but for that I could see a single character domain being useful.

The price for single character domains would be high, because there is really 
only a limited number of URLs available - as stated in the article. I get that 
part.

As far as the success of a URL is concerned, it is difficult to determine how 
well it does compared to a different URL. In order to really make a reasonable 
call both URLs need to be advertised the same way to the same audience. And it 
depends a lot on the audience. In your case you are solely focused on the Mac 
users, but do you honestly think that ?.com would be a good name for a comany 
that sells round push buttons? Yea, it is awesome to have the product 
displayed right in the URL, but it will be odd that online orders come only 
from 4.6% of potential buyers (the market share of the Safari browser).
I understand that it works for you, but be honest, it is a special case.

In which area does Apple lead? Design maybe, but as far as innovation and 
product ideas are concerned, they use stuff that other had long ago.

We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.

But with that said, do you deny that Apple has brought more technical advancements in personal computers than others?

Remember, in 1977, they introduced the Apple ][ -- before that there were no personal computers -- we had to use Main-frames. In 1981-2, they introduced the mouse, which M$ said would never catch on. I could go on, but the point is that from my perspective, they have led the way for the last three decades with more advancements than I can cite here. But that's my experience -- there's no reason to get into a religious war over who's computer is best. Let's not.

Cheers,

tedd

To stay on topic, I think is clear that the validation of the name cannot be
done with a simple regular expression, so do you know any good class or
functions to validate first name and last name?

thanks,

Hi all,

I have an issue I hope someone can help me figure out. We have a Mysql database two php processes that insert new records into a table. There should never be a time when these processes update a record they should only insert a new one. These?processes?run?simultaneously?one running from a cron job and the other running when requested is made via an ajax call.?

For some reason when each process is working at the same time It seems to not insert a new record but update a similar record. I am?explicitly?calling insert and I do not include the primary_key id in the insert statement.?

Just some background I have a table that contains:
id | user_id | item_id | description | debit | price | created | modified

id is the primary key?

a user should have multiple records, each time this is run it adds a new record to the table and the id, price, created and modified should change, item_id could change too.

I thought maybe mysql was getting confused, so I created a stored procedure to do this insert, but it still, on?occasion?updates.

Anyway has anyone?experienced?an issue where mysql will update instead of insert?

Thanks for any leads you might have at resolving this issue.?

Can you post the output from SHOW CREATE TABLE and an example of the 
queries you're running?

Also, please don't create a new topic by hitting reply and changing the 
subject, it breaks threading in most mail clients.

Weird issue, are you using INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY ... UPDATE?
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html

Also if you don't want to receive any MySql error from the INSERT query you
might want to user INSERT IGNORE, it won't do nothing if the row you're
inserting is already there.

Just in case you don't find a simple solution, you can create a pipeline for
the chron job and let him handle all the insert queries.
