Not an issue in this case, since the script is creating both 
directories.  No matter what user it is running as, it will be the owner 
of the directories since it is the one creating the directories.

(though just to be on the safe side, I did rewrite my script to print 
out the uid the script was running under, and the uid of the directory 
and they matched.   I also realized the reason I was getting 755 was due 
to the umask, so I just changed the initial permissions to minimal and 
added a call to chmod - that worked - as far as setting permissions.  
The dang second directory still won't create.  Heck, I even put a 2 
second delay between creations just in case the OS was being flaky )

More and more, I find I am spoiled with my current web provider.  I 
never have these problems with them.  Given that not being an option, 
give me a system I can have root on and can setup things myself.
