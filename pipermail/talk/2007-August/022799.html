Cliff,
I haven't come across anything that does what you are trying to do. But, may
I ask why? You are trying to keep track of something that svn already keeps
track of for you. I say use the tool like it was intended. If you are that
unsure of the commit, make a note of the current revision as a baseline. You
can use the log viewer (in both CLI and Tortise) to see the diffs between
any revision, at any point in the future. If you have to, you can go back to
the baseline. Either by specific file, or the whole commit. I think of it as
&quot;reverse merge&quot; because you are merging the old revision changes in to a new
revision file.

The closest I can come to answering your question is the revision graph. It
will produce a hierarchical representation of all the major changes to a
file., but might not tell you what you are looking for.
