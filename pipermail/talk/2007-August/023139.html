<PRE>&gt;<i> [...] my second attempt was to create a singleton, but the problem  
</I>&gt;<i> is that my model needs configuration data in order to be  
</I>&gt;<i> instantiated correctly. So whenever I would call the getInstance 
</I>&gt;<i> (...) method I need to have the model's configuration data  
</I>&gt;<i> available as I can't always be sure that the getInstance method has  
</I>&gt;<i> been called before and an instance of the model class already exists.
</I>
&gt;<i> [...] I wanted to create a Registry class, add my model to it and  
</I>&gt;<i> access it from whatever method I want. This however makes unit  
</I>&gt;<i> testing harder and has all the site effects which global variables

Sounds like you might find some answers in reading about Dependency  
Injection. I've come across this recently, and it's helped my  
thinking around some of these issues. <A HREF="http://www.martinfowler.com/">http://www.martinfowler.com/</A> 
articles/injection.html I think the key here is the concept of the  
&quot;container&quot;. It's like a class configuration registry.

There was also a good article about Dependency Injection in a recent  
php|architect issue:
<A HREF="http://www.phparch.com/issue.php?mid=82">http://www.phparch.com/issue.php?mid=82</A>

The idea of implementing a generic container seemed a little overkill  
for most of what I was doing. I've found myself using static methods  
to configure a class (rather than a singleton), and I place my  
configuration code in a bootstrap file. For example, the bootstrap  
file might look something like:

require_once 'Proj/SomeModel.php';

Proj_SomeModel::configure(array(
    'option1' =&gt; 'some value',
    'option2' =&gt; 'another value',
));

The boostrap could either be a global one, or one that could be  
required only when I knew I was going to work with the model. The  
model object would then access these static config values within the  
constructor when instantiating itself. Using a model becomes a simple  
as:

require_once 'model-bootstrap.php';

$model = new Proj_SomeModel();

Don't know if this is helpful, or just rehashing things you've  
already tried. Care to share more details about what you've tried so  
far?
