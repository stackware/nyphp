Sure they do - because Java requires essentially it's own server to run.

Quite true - mod_perl can do more, but as far as I know, still not as much
as Tomcat since they're linked at the hip.

&gt;<i> Overall, though, I suspect all parties (Apache, PHP, Tomcat, Rails.

Hmm, interesting...

While it seems like a good idea, it'd probably cause more grief... think of
all those poor images, CSS, PDFs, JS, static HTML, etc. files out there that
we assume get served directly, correctly, statically - and quickly - right
from the filesystem.

&gt;<i> web server were designed to allow all URLs to be delegated to specific

Well that essentially exists with AddHandler and friends in Apache, and is
essentially the crux of many of the techniques described in this thread.

</I>&gt;<i> RESTful API *design* is fairly easy to do. RESTful API

</I>&gt;<i> by pretending its something else we're more familiar with.

</I>
Agreed - I'm still waiting for XSLT to take us by storm.  And I keep that
Javascript turned off in my browser, since no web site should depend on it
being available... right?

Web's 20 ?= Web 2.0  It's just a decimal point away...
