Subject: [nycphp-talk] php oracle/tomcat
Message-ID: <445670B3.2060307@aarond.com>

I'm trying to setup php & oracle to run on a win2k server using tomcat. 
The current php works but when I enable the php_oci8.dll file it hangs. 
I know when using IIS I had to enable an IUSER access on the oracle 
folder, but not with Tomcat.  Am I missing an installation step?

Thanks,
Aaron D.

did you compile php or use an RPM? If you compiled from source did you
set the --wtih-mysql flag?

can you connect to mysql from the command line?  There is an issue with
how MySQL < 4  && MySQL >= 4.1 handle the passwords.  

Can you post the errors you recieve?

Hi,

You need to load the MySQLi extension instead I beleive ...

http://us3.php.net/mysqli

You most likely need to enable it in your php.ini ...

Also, if you compiled from source you should pull up your phpinfo()  
and copy the Configure Command and recompile w/ it + add this:

--with-mysqli=/path/to/my/mysql_config

mysqli only works with PHP 5, he's using 4.3.10.  The mysql extension will 
work with MySQL 4.1 & 5, though it won't let you take advantage of some 
features those versions offer.

do ldd /usr/local/bin/php and ldd /usr/local/apache/libexec/libphp4.so (or whichever/whereever apache module is)
You will be able to see if its compiled with libmysqlclient
Which OS is this, and which errors do you get?

as an aside, YES  check those log files.  99% of the time you'll find
the bug there.

I had a few chances in life so far to sit side by side with some
hardcore kernal hackers, those guys were mind blowing at the commad
line, and one thing I always noticed, they were always tailing the log
files.

Chatting up one guy:

I'm off dude
Where?
Into the cage
What!
Yep, steel wired cage, they're locking me in 24 hours straight, no RF
leakage shit.
What!
Yep, intel-NSA shit
What!  How do you get yourself up for that?
I prepare a really nice bong hit before I go in.
What!  And they don't care?
Are you fuc$ing kidding me? . . .

and so it goes . . .  :-)

remember those log files!

Come hear Jon Bentley of Avaya Labs Research share 'Tricks of the Programming Trade!' 

What makes a great programmer? Clever ideas can often be traced to education, experience or heredity. Sometimes, though, insights come from "tricks of the trade". This talk describes three software tricks in detail: defining the right problem, back-of-the-envelope calculations, and debugging. It also surveys several others. Discussion will range from principles to war stories, with a special bonus theorem tossed in for good measure. Audience interaction is essential.

Greetings all;
  As I continue to dig into my problem here, I am
having problems trying to resolve this one.  

I had to switch a website to a new machine.  The old
machine was running fine.  I have everything working
(from first observation).  I have a perl script page
that runs fine.  However I have a PHP app that fails
with the following error:

HTTP 500 - Internal server error 
Internet Explorer 

Looking in the error log this is what I see:

[Fri May 05 10:20:03 2006] [error] [client
66.249.65.40] (8)Exec format error: exec of
'/var/www/html/guestbook/index.php' failed
[Fri May 05 10:20:03 2006] [error] [client
66.249.65.40] Premature end of script headers:
index.php

I am wondering if an owner/group issue may be the
problem.  Mind you I just copied everything over from
the old machine to the new (linux 2 linux).

Being somewhat new to all of this I know I have a lot
to learn.  

Your help is greatly appriciated.

Kurt Zimmerman

This is a common error on CGI scripts.  That error usually comes up 
because the script isn't sending a content type, eg:

   Content-type: text/html\n\n

But this is rarely an issue with PHP because PHP sends that automatically 
for you.  What are your settings for the following php.ini items:

   default_mimetype
   output_buffering
   display_errors

That's what I thought.  Sounds like you're sending some sort of regular 
output before the headers are done going out.  Turn display errors on (or 
look in your _PHP_ error logs if you have them on) and you'll likeley get 
an error message that will help you track down where.

Hi all:

I've run into a perplexing problem.

I'm dealing with a situation with a client where all of their content 
is being dumped from an old version of FileMaker (5.5), and it is 
coming out as windows-1252 encoded.

Though I always suggest that my clients have text encoded in UTF-8, 
since it is then prepared for internationalization in a sensible way, 
in this instance, I dealt with the windows encoding in order to save 
myself the headache.

However, we ran into a site feature of theirs that basically required 
AJAX, because they wanted to display an endless bunch of data in a 
small place without a page reload required to see more items.  I 
didn't know until I built the feature that AJAX requests default to 
UTF-8.

Of course, it seems that most browsers detect that the page the 
content is coming into is encoded as windows 1252...except...you 
guessed it...Internet Explorer for Windows.  So, in that browser, my 
extended characters are being mangled.

Some searching around uncovered this blog article which outlines a 
potential workaround:

http://www.taylanpince.com/blog/AJAX-and-Multibyte-Character-Support.html

The problem is, the workaround relies on the mb_string functions, 
which unfortunately are not active on the server I have to work on.

So, the question is....am I SOL, or has anyone here ever devised a 
cleverer solution to this problem?

Of course, my preferred solution is to just have all the content be 
UTF-8 encoded...I'm also speaking with the client to see if his 
programmer can dump out the data in that format.  But I'm trying to 
hedge my bets.

Thanks,

Marc:

I didn't know that -- where's that default at?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you are simply injecting code into a 
static web page, isn't it the <meta... utf-8> tab of the page that 
sets the charset?

Ajax simply prompts a php routine to prepare stuff for ajax to take 
back an inject into whatever you want between html tags, right? At 
least that's the way I'm doing it -- but, I'm simple that way.

See http://xn--ovg.com -- I have several ajax examples there and I'm 
currently working on a similar project as you -- namely creating a 
static web page that takes an endless bunch of data and presents it 
to the viewer without reloading. I should be done with it by today, 
if you want to collaborate.

Character encoding is a state of mind... by which I mean, what happens
if the page that the data is being sucked into has the 1252 encoding,
in IE only? But I guess then you'd have to convert the rest of the
page to 1252 for IE, which probably means you're back where you
started.

You could build a web service on a cheapo server that had mb_string
support, and pass all the calls through that (caching them, of
course).

This will be an ongoing problem as all those systems which were built
before unicode come due for rewrites.

Without doing any research, I would also guess the setting the charset
via a meta or HTTP header should fix this.

If not, does you server have the iconv() extension enabled? That lets
you convert between arbitrary character sets.

hi,

I'm looking for a plug and play php/mysql forum application for a web
site I'm finishing up.

I've looked at zillions over the years, and was never really 100%
happy. I was wondering are there any new Web 2.0ish wannabes  on the
block?  Soft and fluffy?  Very lightweight? OR  AKA "is there a
perfect, web based  forum  application out here?"

thanks, ed  :-)

I'm a big fan of SMF from Simple Machines (www.simplemachines.org). We
use it to power the Joomla community forums which are pretty high
traffic and have many posts. Not aware of any newfangled modern forums
out there.

I recall looking at Vanilla a little while ago. I just looked again.

There's nothing like the php talklist to keep you mindful of your PHP 
fundamentals (such as the use of single and double quotes..ahem)  and 
there's nothing like XAMPP to *force* you to get it right lol. But now 
that I fixed vanilla's installer it looks pretty good. Still a ways from 
what i consider stable, and I see plenty of comments about IE rendering 
issues.

Last time I settled on punbb.org because it was sooooo easy to get 
integrated and done with. Not at all web2.0-ey, but I didn't want to 
spend the time.

And I will follow up that reply with more info.... I grabbed the current 
SVN trunk and it is far improved from 0.9.x.x "current stable" offered 
on getvanilla. It appears they are close to a 1.0 release.

I like it so far.

To clarify this for everyone: the character encoding of the page is 
in windows-1252.  Therefore, in my opinion, the browser ought to 
display all the content in the character set.

But, in researching AJAX, I've found that the httprequest object 
defaults all communication to UTF-8, no matter whether you set 
character encoding on it with a PHP header or not.  Most browsers 
seem to detect this and display the proper characters.

IE, though, doesn't.  I assume it would display the characters fine 
if my entire page was set with UTF-8 encoding, but unfortunately, 
unless I get my client to change their system, this isn't going to 
happen.

Here's the page in question (a rare book seller with a flair for the 
whimsical):

http://209.160.72.79/btc/search_results?btc_keywords=grass&x=0&y=0

There is a 'module' at the top of the page with some author info. 
Int he middle, on the left, are some product results.  Then, on the 
right, a narrower module contains related reference information about 
the author...this is the info coming into the page from AJAX (in this 
case, there are only a few responses, but sometimes there are dozens, 
in which case that module has some navigation to further items).

So, Gunter Grass' name gets mangled in IE.  It looks fine in all 
browsers that matter on OS X, and with another 'fix' I can get it to 
work in Firefox on Windows...but IE is just not doing it.

If anyone has any ideas, feel free to enlighten me.

I am trying to lobby them to perform some character encoding on the 
data before it gets to the server (it's a complicated system where 
all data is managed in an offline database, and it synchronizes with 
the web server via a series of cron jobs on their end and on the 
server).

Cheers,

Marc

I'm curious... What made you try downgrading from 3 to 2 to discover
this?  Are you using prefork or another MPM?  Have you compared
callgrind data when running 3 vs. 2?

Please send more details and/or updates.  I, for one, would like to hear
more.

Honestly, in this case, it was dumb luck - we happened to have one box that was still running U2 in the cluster we were using for stress testing.  We were watching the performance of each box, and I noticed that one was consistently answering requests more quickly than the rest.  The only difference was the update version of RHEL4.  We then tried rolling back more machines and testing and we found that it really was faster.
 
I haven't used callgrind, myself.  We used a combination of various tools to benchmark and profile things - strace, sar, top, vmstat, iostat, etc. on the host level, apd for php, and finally, measuring things like response time, throughput, etc. on the webserver level.
 
Finally - we're using prefork.  I haven't heard particularly good things about PHP/APC running under any other MPM.  (It may be improved now; I haven't checked.)

AJAX uses XMLHttpRequest() which uses XML. And XML uses UTF-8 unless 
  transportation layer (HTTP) or the XML declaration say otherwise.

If I've understood the problem correctly we have following situation:

1) HTTP server sends a text/html document X to browser with 
windows-1252 encoding
2) X contains javascript which uses XMLHttpRequest (a.k.a. AJAX) to 
query another web server Y.
3) Y returns XML document Z with HTTP without specifying header 
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=windows-1252 and without XML 
declaration such as <?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?>.
4) X fails to correctly display results from Z because the browser 
"incorrectly" uses UTF-8.

If this is the case, the only way to fix the problem is to fix Y so 
that it sends correct HTTP headers (or XML declaration but HTTP 
headers are more important to get right).

The other reason for failing could be that the browser doesn't 
understand the non-standard character set name "windows-1252". Try 
to use "iso-8859-1" instead which is almost similar encoding and 
should be well supported.

That's what I thought.  Sounds like you're sending
some sort of regular 
output before the headers are done going out.  Turn
display errors on 
(or 
look in your _PHP_ error logs if you have them on) and
you'll likeley 
get 
an error message that will help you track down where.

Dan, et el;

For some reason I am not able to get a log to come
out.  I've double checked the settings in the php.ini
file and it looks good.

Several other items.  I've piped the script thru PHP
to produce the html to a file.  The output file looks
fine.  

Also I have imbedded PHP code in my index.htm main
page which runs fine.


Still searching.

Having a hard time figuring this one out..

We moved a large data store from MySQL 5.0.2-alpha to MySQL 4.1.12

All the high-bit chars -- which were stored fine in MySQL 5 -- are being
mangled in MySQL 4.  So, for example, if an editor pastes text from MS Word
or another language, instead of storing the actual characters I get a bunch
of gobbeldy-gook.

(Unfortunately, 5 isn't up anymore, so I can't compare collation.)

Does anyone have any insight as to what may be going on?  (I had routines
all up and running to clean high-bit chars that are now choking on their
mangled equiv.)

I have a file upload class that works everywhere but on the production server.

The production and development environments are Windows, running
Apache. My test environment is Linux, running Apache.

The weirdest thing is that in production, I can upload PDF files, but
when I try to upload images, it completely fails. I keep getting the
'permission denied' message on the image directory.

Any ideas?

It's just completely perplexing that I can upload PDF files, but not
images. It's the same code!

Which character set did you use in MySQL5? Did you use 
--default-character-set=latin1 or something else with mysqldump/MySQL5?

mysqldump of MySQL5 may give "interesting" output if you have 
incorrectly set character set. I had once many 8 bit bytes replaced 
with literal "?" which caused many problems later on. The behavior 
of mysqldump did change between MySQL4 and MySQL5.

If you have been using windows-1252 character set or something that 
uses pretty much all 8 bit bytes, expect problems with mysqldump if 
you don't have correct character set.

Are you using the --compatible option when mysqldump'ing? It may not be

I'm guessing the default character set for all the tables on your system 
in 5 was UTF-8 while in 4 it's latin1.

I already tried setting the charset / collation to utf-8 -- both on tables /
fields -- but resaving data produces the same mangled results.

Unfortunately -- and this is really just corporate politics (meh) -- another
firm setup Apache/MySQL, and they haven't exactly been forthcoming with
this, so I can't as of yet compare old-new charset's.

Also unfortunately, all I can tell on my end is that when we moved data from
Apache 1.3.33 (Unix) / MySQL 5.02-alpha to Apache 2.0.52 (CentOS) / MySQL
4.1.12, high-bit data became mangled.  I'd be more than happy to suggest
changes on the Apache-level, but my job is the management of content by way
of PHP, and I don't know what I'd suggest that would help..

How did you do that?  ALTER TABLE?  If so, that's too late.

Open up the SQL script created by mysqldump.  What's the default charset 
defined in the CREATE TABLE statements?

latin1_swedish_ci.  When I ALTER TABLE, it successfully updates to
utf8_general_ci.  Why is it too late?  Do I need to re-dump?

On the tax front, this is probably what you're referring to:

http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/03/29/court_rules_telecommuter_must_pay_taxes/

I talked about a handful of the issues here:
http://blogs.caseysoftware.com/?q=node/65  This was after I spoke with
an accountant who  *admittedly* didn't know the full implications of
how this ruling was going to be interpretted elsewhere.

Here is the joyous tax of which you speak:
"NYC Unincorporated Business Tax"
http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/pdf/05pdf/nyc202_05i.pdf
http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/pdf/05pdf/nyc202_05.pdf

As you can see, if you don't make enough money, you don't incur this tax.  If you do incur it, it looks to be 4% of gross income attributable to the business carried on "partly" in NYC.

I did many years ago so take what I say with a grain of salt David, i.e. 
verify it still works this way.

AFAIK it is true.

>If so how much is it

Depends on how much you earn in NYC. :) Check for forms and booklets 
http://www.tax.state.ny.us/

>and would I have to pay it even if I'm on a 1099?

Yep. You'll either be filing as a sole proprietor or corporation, right? 
Either way you're responsible for taxes including withholding taxes and 
don't be late because they get you with fees when you are. You will also 
have to pay NYS tax iirc. They will - or at least used to - credit your NJ 
income tax but since that's less than NY tax your out of pocket will be the 
same as if you lived in NY.

>I am trying to decide between 2 job offers right now, one of them is in 
>New Jersey, and the other one is in NYC.

OTOH if your main work location is your local office then you may be able 
to deduct travelling costs. Might be worth some intensive reading of the 
tax pubs, or even a 1 hour consult with an accountant familiar with this 
situation.

Jeff,

Actually no..  I figured i would offer it here to other programmers because
i dont expect to get market price for it, if no one here wants it i will
sell it locally or on ebay.
but atleast i thought to offer it to other php developers who may not be
able to afford a new system and this is reletively new.

In that case maybe you will get a better response if you explain exactly
what it is you are trying to achieve.

I suspect you can do an ASCII # search in your SELECT statment, look
for a range, that should do it.

i wish it were that simple.....I have to build this into the current 
system, and that would mean getting all the values between the start and 
end and populating the database with those values.

if all else fails, try brute force...

$range = array();
foreach (range(0,9) as $digit):
	foreach (range('A','Z') as $alpha):
		$range[] = 'A'.$digit.$alpha ;
	endforeach;
endforeach;

AFAICT: PHP(5) can natively count by base 36.

$min = 'A0A';
$max = 'A9Z';
for ($i = $min; $i < $max; ++$i)
{
    echo $i, '<br />';
}

Hey list...
This has got to be one of the weirdest posts I have read in here, LOL.
But, nonetheless, it hints of pure genious, Flavio. Congrats... Shucks, base
36.... How does anyone think of that?

That's the character set you got when dumping from MySQL 5?  You said you 
had the unusual characters working nicely in MySQL 5.  But how can that 
be if you had the character set as latin1?

Because importing to a latin1 table modifies the original UTF-8 data -- 
assuming it was UTF-8, of course.

Since you say that you changed it to utf8, I guess the original data 
was supposed to be with UTF-8 character set, but because MySQL5 
dumped it with latin1_swedish_ci you never did tell MySQL5 about the 
fact (this happens pretty much automatically if you upgrade from 
MySQL4 which pretty much didn't have a clue about UTF-8).

However, MySQL5 in its infinite wishdom replaces invalid characters 
in the mysqldump output with a literal "?" (U+003F) instead of 
leaving those bytes as is. Latin1 doesn't define byte range 128-159 
so MySQL5 replaces those bytes with literal "?" if you use mysqldump 
without correct settings (UTF-8 encoded strings may include bytes in 
range 128-159 and if you replace those bytes with a literal "?" 
you'll end up with invalid UTF-8 encoding). You will not notice this 
problem if you just do INSERT, UPDATE and SELECT from some other 
application because this modification doesn't happen in that case.

In short, yes, you have to re-dump from MySQL5. Hopefully you have 
the binary table data still available.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] $_SESSION in Static function
Message-ID: <BAY20-F12349641959FEF8A7E3F5CFCAF0@phx.gbl>


I found a very tricky problem with a wrapper class that I had coded for 
setting and getting variables in $_SESSION super global array. The class is 
an utility class having function
HttpRequest::GetSessionParm() and  HttpRequest::SetSessionParm() to get and 
set values in $_SESSION resply. I was under the impression that $_SESSION 
need not be defined as 'global' within class methods but this wrapper class 
initially failed when the system was deployed on FreeBSD machine. It worked 
when I added 'global $_SESSION' within the above mentioned static methods. I 
am not aware of the reason. It worked fine on my machine (windows 2000 
professional). Any reason available for the problem will be appreciated.

Thanx,
Vamsi

Did you check PHP version? IIRC, older versions of PHP didn't have 
super globals at all...

Here is the code for those two functions

/**

   * if $escaped is true, the returned value is first
   * escaped using addslashes function before returning
   */
  static function GetSessionParm($param,$escaped=false)

    if (array_key_exists($param, self::$data["session"]))
     return (($escaped) ? addslashes(self::$data["session"][$param]) :
self::$data["session"][$param]);
    else
     return null;
   else
    return null;
  }

  /**

   */
  static function SetSessionParm($param,$value)
  {
   global $_SESSION;
   $_SESSION[$param] = $value;
   self::$data["session"] = $_SESSION;
  }

if I remove the global $_SESSION the session data isnot being maintaned from

So -- just so I get this straight -- say I ALTER TABLE to set the default
character set to be UTF-8, then insert a brand new record filled with
high-bit chars, it will still not be able to read certain characters and
introduce '?' and whatnot in their stead?

Ten

It's still "ten" regardless of what the dictionary may say. Ten is 
not defined by the base 10.

For example, you don't say "one" is not "one" because it belongs to 
another base, do you?

Or, as in the case of base 16, you don't have another pronunciation 
for "A", do you?

Such as in:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10

10 in any number system is still ten.

Hey, did you ever solve this?

I have no clue why this would happen, so I'm curious if you found the culprit...

Not exactly.  Ten is merely a name we give to the digit sequence 1 0
when representing a number in base 10.

If you called 10 base 2 Ten, what would you call 1010 base 2?

If you were saying 10 base 2 out loud, you should probably just say Two,
though that kind of defeats the purpose of the joke...

Yeah, there was a type in the code.

Instead of...

$newFileName=$this->fname;

...I had...

$newFileName=$this->tname;

Whe I passed the version with tname to the copy() function, it was failing.

It drove me nuts.

Nope, it's the name I give to any number representing a base placeholder.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder

Follow Free_variables_and_bound_variables link:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables

Ten is simply a variable meant to represent the second placeholder in a number.

>If you called 10 base 2 Ten, what would you call 1010 base 2?

One thousand ten.

Thousand is simply a variable meant to represent the fourth 
placeholder in a number.

The characters "t" and "n" do not exist in the Hex character set, so 
the string "ten" can't exist there.
The character "0" doesn't exist either, so the string "10" also can't 
exist there.

You can't say what doesn't exist.

Of course, the concept "ten" (which could also be represented as "10" 
or as "1010") does exist in Hex, and it would have to be pronounced "ay".

So the point of the original joke is that it can only be read, not 
pronounced, to be effective, because reading it tricks you into 
mixing up the two bases (if I remember it right).

Hi Jon,

If I understand correctly, you are making a proxy script (kinda like
Anonymizer). If so, you need to process HTML of the page you just processed
and update all the links to go through your script.

You should take a look at CGIProxy <http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/
>

You want to somehow rewrite the links/images/etc to point to your proxy. 
Use regex/str_replace of some sort to scan and replace urls (eg: 
http://othersite.com/page.htm) with your proxy (eg: 
http://mysite.com/proxy.php?url=othersite.com/page.htm) and so on.

Its actually somewhat tricky (need to parse css, and html doing 
replacements. And there are many different places to replace.)

Best of luck

I've built a PHP proxy few years ago also. Are you using the web proxy with
www-client (~Firefox) or are you using it with Curl or some library like
that? 

Because after you have configured the web-proxy to web browser it should use
it to all links/images/data files automatically. Have you checked that there
ain't any list of sites that should be connected directly?

Main problem with my proxy-server was ability to reuse socket connection
with following request's from same source. First it would be easiest to add
an extra header to content you send to browser (or Curl) with following
line: "Connection: close" . I recommend that you build somekind of header
parser that can modify received and forwarded headers. For example all kinds
of cache headers could be that way disabled (if so wanted). 

If you make header parser it is quite easy to add for example max image
filesizes and conversion from different file formats to another. This way I
can now browse web with my mobilephone because all pictures are converted
and sent much smaller than they appear at websites.

AFAIK: $_SESSION should be available in the global scope.  My wonder
would be if there is a logic issue, as looking at the provided code,
there could be an issue in the GetSessionParm () call if there wasn't a
prior call to SetSessionParm () in the same page request.  The
'self::$data["session"] = $_SESSION;' is only set in the SetSessionParm
function and thus on a new page hit calling GetSessionParam () would
report null.  I would also check to make sure session_start() is being
called in all cases before accessing your session wrapper.

Another note with regards to addslashes.  Although it is good that you
are doing something, be cautioned that addslases is a _generic_ (if all
 else fails) kind of safety function.  In practice, it is usually best
if you properly escape your output specifically for the subsystem it
will be handed off to.  For example, if you will be passing those
variables to a database, use a database escape function
pg_escape_string() (postgresql), mysql_escape_string(), etc. [or data
binding.]  If you are passing it to a command line, use
escapeshellcmd()/escapeshellargs(), if you are sending to browser, use
htmlentities().  The reason for this is that each subsystem has their
own set of metacharacters, and a generic solution like addslashes may
not give you the maximum protection PHP offers.

Hope that helps

No.  OLD DATA will not magically fixed, which is what you were talking

That's just the thing:  new data gets mangled in the exact same way, which
is why I thought it wasn't a charset-collation issue.

Hi Flav,

Your views regarding the class have been very helpful to me. I designed this
wrapper class in a very absurd manner. I was learning by expermenting in
developing wrapper classes and eventually and very regretfully I also
implemented it in a live environment (my mistake). Your point is right in
case the 'data' member is not filled prior to calling GetSessionParm(). This
is how I Use this class

There is an Initialization procedure common to all pages in another utility
class called page.class.php. Following is a snippet from it.


    //Set session timeout to 2hrs
    ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', 2*60*60);

    if (!session_id())
     session_start();
    self::$formDataObj = new HttpRequest();

The constructor of HttpRequest says

function __construct()
  {
        $this->SetFormData();
  }

and the SetFormData is like this

/**
   * This function get the information from
   * POST,GET,REQUEST and SESSION arrays and stores
   * it in the object's data attribute
   */
  public function SetFormData($data = null)
  {
     global $_SESSION;

     if(null == $data)
     {
      self::$data["post"] = isset($_POST) ? $_POST : null;
      self::$data["get"] = isset($_GET) ? $_GET : null;
      self::$data["request"] = isset($_REQUEST) ? $_REQUEST : null;
      self::$data["session"] = isset($_SESSION) ? $_SESSION : null;
     }
     else
     {
      self::$data = $data;
     }

  }

when GetSessionParam is called the session data should have been set into
the data member varible.

Pl. let me know if there is again any critical prob. in this code. This code
has worked without any 'global' declartion on two of our installations one
local(windows) and other live (linux) but when the server was shifted
somehow the user was not able to login to the system. When I tracked the
prob. it came to be that after validating the user the system puts an object
in the session indicating the validity and this object is not available on
another page using GetSessionParm.

The prob. is somewhere in this classs itself because $_SESSION alone works
fine.

your notes regarding use of addslashes had been very informative for me. I
am thankful to you.

(I still wonder why I created a constructor to fill static data :)  )

Regards,

Vamsi

Message-ID: <001f01c675d8$39698440$68e4a144@Rubicon>

Dear Daniel Convissor or Hans or other Gurus: 

I want to safely upgrade MySQL on Windows Server 2003. 
I saw Dan's great tutorial at
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/mybasic.htm#installation 
Based on current practices and issues, can I do the following: 

Move 1: The Upgrade 
1) Grab the "Windows (x86) Installer" to install MySQL 5. 
2) NET STOP mysql 
a) Install MySQL5 into new, unique directories. 
b) Specify a new name for the mysqld service. 
c) Listen on a different port. 
d) Run >> mysql_upgrade --user=root_user --password=user_pwd
--basedir=mysql5_basedir --datadir=mysql5_datadir 

Does moving from 4.1 to 5 introduce a new password encryption style issue
like 3.2 to 4.1? 
Will the above steps give me two safely seperated instances of MySQL on the
same box? 


Move 2: Data Transfer 
1) Dump the old MySQL 4.1 data, as Dan suggests. 
2) Make the "TYPE=ISAM" to "TYPE=MyISAM" change inside the dump file. 
3) Import into MySLQ 5. 

Will the above steps work and give me a dual MySQL4 and MySQL5? 

Thanks to any and all who can comment.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT?  reverse mod_rewrite
Message-ID: <20060515094829.268a6cab@openpad.genoverly.home>

I'm trying to keep 'pretty' urls on this small webiste I'm working on.

I have a page that presents 'our stores' in the 50 US States, so users
can find one. The page opens and there is select box for states.  The
user selects one and hits GO (form action=post)  The stores are listed,
grouped by city and ordered by store.  The store name are actually
links; when clicked it shows store details like address, hours, etc.

Those store links are done in 'pretty form'.  I wrote the rewrite rules
to break up an incoming request like this: 
	/root/find/state/city/store_id ..into..
	index.php?NAV=store_finder;STATE=state;CITY=city;SID=store_id

Every is working well.  My problem is cosmetic.. after selecting a store
and viewing the information, the pretty url is in the browser bar.  If
the user selects a new state, the form works (I capture the post in
PHP), but the browser bar still shows the previous request.

This was way-to-much info to ask.. 

How do I capture GET/POST variables in mod_rewrite so I can use them?

I know I could change the 'form action=get' and there is a {QUERY
STRING} available to me in mod_rewrite, but I could not figure out how
to get the vars out of it BEFORE it gets passed along.  I need to
reverse; ?selected_state=NY ..into.. /root/find/NY .. and let existing
rules take over.

Can anyone give a nudge in the right direction?

A few suggestions:

Have an absolute URI for the form action, and then make all generated
store location links with the pretty URI just as you do for the initial
landing.

Or perhaps checking the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] in the code that
processes the "new state" switch.  Then issue a header('Location ...')
if needed.

Hopefully helpful

Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.0.20060515103635.03c7da70@usats.com>

Hello,

	I upgraded to PHP5 and the upgrade went smoothly. There is a
major difference with array_merge() in PHP5 if one of the arrays is null.
$Array1 = array_merge($Array2,$Array3);
If either $Array2 or Array3 is null $Array1 will be null even though the other
array is loaded.

	Is anyone aware of a listing of function containing potential upgrade
problems when upgrading to PHP5.

	I also had a problem with session_register() which I solved by
simply assigning variables to the super global $_SESSION

Hello all,

I am using a windows keyborad on a mac G5 with zend studio, i noticed
everytime i hit alt-c to commit the changes to svn it seems to add this
charachter to the end of the line.  I dont see it harming the code but i
dont think i like it adding charachters.

?

Any idea what this may be caused by?  It doesnt do it if i right click and
commit through the zend menu but that is a pain.

Thanks,

Greg - 

 

I'm essentially in the same situation you are - making the decision
between Cake and Symfony.  Your post is from January - have you come to
a decision since then?  I am leaning toward Symfony due primarily to the
abundance of documentation and the general 'buzz' I have been noticing
on the net, but I'm curious to know which framework you went with.

 

Thanks,

Jack

Prototype is scratching a lot of itch for me right now. I think of it
as JavaScript 2.0. Not sure what extra candy you get when using it
with Rails, but it sure is useful with php. My only gripe is that
there is no API documentation that combines "standard" and Prototype
js, so you have to keep at least two tabs open to get the full story:
http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html
and http://www.krook.org/jsdom/  (thanks, Dan!)

I have also been using the visual effects and drag-n-drop features in
Script.aculo.us, though I hacked that up pretty heavily to support
multiple-selection.

I want to add Behavior, too, just to get all the <script> tags out of
the markup, but I haven't gotten that far down on the list. As I
understand it, Behavior assigns js functionality to css classes, so
that every div with class="draggable" can automatically be registered
as draggable.

Have you looked @ JQuery yet? (http://jquery.com), it is pretty slick  
in that it combines your "selector" as exactly what your stylesheet  
corresponds to select multiple elements.

The nice thing about RJS in Rails is that you get a page context  
object which allows you to control a "behind the scenes" update  
pretty neatly.  Im sure you can hack together the same thing w/ Sajax  
or similar.

However looking more closely @ it .. it basically just "translates"  
from one language (Ruby) to Javascript (to eval <scripts> coming  
back), so Im pretty sure a PHP-clone would be doable for Smarty  
views ...

$page["mydiv"]->highlight(); // or something like that

That "translation" is missing from what I have seen, or does Cake/ 
Symf already do it?  What do the guys @ Ning use?

I am personally married to dojo, but if you're looking at cake,
scriptaculous (prototype) is great and it has cake support.

It also depends on what you need, if it's just plain XHR requests, xajax is
available as well. From what I see, Dojo and prototype have a lot of
momentum, so I personally would stick with one of the big ones as there
will be more development in the future.

Oh man, that dojo thing is in a league of it's own, with documentation
(almost) and everything. I'll be using that on the *next* project...

Carlos (or anyone else) if you've used prototype, can you give a quick
summary of the relative merits of dojo vs. prototype?

Does dojo give you the same ability to easily create and extend your
own classes?

I'd love to see a NYPHP presentation about this stuff -- what cool

world -- and get a better idea what the hell you guys are talking about.
Sure, anybody can google and read -- looking at this dojo thing is already
accelerating my pulse -- but it still sounds like an interesting
presentation, doesn't it?

(Don't look at me, I'll be in the audience.)

Did you set any ErrorDoc's in your http.conf?

ErrorDocument 500 /blablabla.php
ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl"
ErrorDocument 402 http://www.example.com/subscription_info.html

Or was that error the default 404 page for xampp?

yes that's the default 404 for XAMPP.

Check the DrrorDocument settings (as above, or locally in .htaccess) and 
get back to us.

(side note: sometimes people only get to setting custom error docs when 
they are going "live". If you are planning to go live on XAMPP, there 
maybe other issues you want to address because XAMPP is designed for 
non-secure, development stuff an dnot producton)

No I didn't set the Error Docs in http.conf
Can I set them just by uncommenting them and then making the actual pages? This would be ideal!

Also thanks Jack!

Hi Jon,

I use the xajax framework, which is very fast and lightweight. Also, it 
does all the javascript things for me so I just have to care about the 
PHP side. I like it, maybe you give it a try?

That is the big one, outside of the obvious pieces (like, certain XML
extensions are gone).

There is also the bit about not being able to return non-variables by
reference, but I believe that was also merged into PHP 4.x.

I have a pretty complete list in Appendix B (I think B) of 'Upgrading
to PHP 5'. I think there is one on php.net, which is free, but I can't
remember where. Maybe someone else has the list?

Documentation? Maybe I should be asking you questions ;-)

Dojo has a really cool build system so you can pick and choose the features
you need, and it has a great event system. There's also persistency
libraries (using flash movies as storage), and iframes workaround for
things like back button support.

Yep, Dojo has a couple of functions (inherits and extend). Keep in mind
that both prototype and dojo extend javascript to add more power to the
language.

Last week at the ajax experience, I heard the following comparison:
"Prototype is like a Porsche and Dojo is like a Hummer". Prototype has the
Ruby-like iterators, very coder friendly, while Dojo is very engineered
with a lot of function extensions.

Carlos Hoyos,

And you can't seem to compile it on OS X @ the moment :-\  It's seems  
like a black-box translation for Swing-like components, but pretty  
slick how the <meta> tags are gathered up to param the code.

The latest copy of the Y! UI components (http://developer.yahoo.com/ 
yui/index.html) also seem to be nice "PHP-friendly" libraries.  Im  
almost positive that some kind of Smarty / view-based plugin can make  
use of all these tools and do the same.  (Forgive me if the  
frameworks already do this, still going through Cake, Symfony, and  
Zoop).

That's the list of BC breaks in PHP5.

Not a terribly long list, but I suppose they could catch you by surprise.

Hi guys:

I labeled this out as 'OT', because it started out as a PHP mail() 
issue, but it apparently has nothing to do with PHP.

I am getting a bit desperate and honestly don't really have the 
budget for a dedicated sysadmin on this project, but I'll give 
someone some $$$ or some lovely item(s) from their amazon wish list 
if they can help me with something.

The problem, succinctly stated, is: the server can email some domains 
(such as mine, and gmail.com) and not others (such as mac.com, 
hotmail.com, and the client's).

The reason, I suspect, is reverse DNS issues, the server's 'SMTP 
banner' (which is wrong), or some other thing.

I think the client's domain is a special case, because the domain is 
on the same machine as a Web host, but the email is elsewhere.

But mac.com and hotmail.com and so forth are something else; they 
must be rejecting the mail (or possibly never receiving it?)

I'm not getting mail bouncebacks to the reply-to address, so it's 
possible that our server is holding the emails and not even sending 
them out.

The hosting company (servermatrix) told me that there are two likely 
causes:  reverse DNS and the resolv.conf file

I have had them add reverse dns pointers, and I checked myself that 
resolv.conf had their DNS server's IP addresses in it.

I've been reading about reverse DNS, and "Envelope-to:" addresses, 
and all sorts of other things, and it's not making much sense to me. 
I figured someone else must know the ins and outs of this stuff.

If someone can help me with this, or point me in the right direction 
of what to troubleshoot first, it would be greatly appreciated.  you 
could also contact me off-list.

Cheers,

Try using phpMailer and the $mail->Host ="your server domain" parameter.

I am assuming you are sending mail from a script on a shared host?

Good Luck

Hi Russ:

No, actually this is a dedicated server.  The host is 'shared' in 
that we have three virtual domains on it...maybe they are not all set 
up properly or something.

I did the setup myself via cpanel, and haven't really p[layed outside 
that sandbox.

Thanks for the response.  I'll try PHPMailer's host setting and see 
if that helps.

Marc

Russ- phpMailer is an interface to the sendmail function which uses an
MTA like sendmail or POSTFIX, so adding this to the mix wont do
anything.

Marc - Your host is right, you need proper SPF (Sender Policy
Framework)records as well as a record which resolves to your mail server
IE: mail.myserver.com
Go here and use these tools: http://www.dnsstuff.com/
Also, are you handling your DNS or your host?

Ah - Cpanel.  So you must be running exim for the MTA then...

In a shell run:
    exigrep emailthat at doesntwork.com /var/log/exim_mainlog
You'll hopefully find the log entries related to the emails that aren't going
through.  If it isn't readily apparent what the problem is, send along 1 or 2
sets of log entries for an email.

You can also run:
    exim -bp
... to see your the mail queue.  But that won't show you why they are sitting
in the queue.

HTH,
Andrew

Jack is right.  Don't skip his advice.

No matter how much software you add it won't matter. Your mail
exchanger hostname needs to lookup forward AND reverse correctly in
DNS.

Tell your provider you need a pointer record to match your mail
exchange record.  (PTR for your MX)

It does sound like an open SPF issue.  Check that your from field 
matches the dns lookup of the domain by IP. More servers every day are 
dropping mail that says it comes from a domain that doens't pass lookup 
inspection.

Thanks!

Yes, I think the big surprise is actually how relatively easy it is to
migration from PHP 4 to PHP 5, assuming you're not using XML. :)

         To me this is a bug. If you want to merge two arrays and one is null,
why should the target be null? I would think the target array would be equal
to the non-null array in the parameter list.

try checking to see if you are listed on any RBL's.

check the vhost IP against something like www.openrbl.org.  If its listed,
get a different vhost provider.

Those domains (hotmail/mac.com)  still accept mail _WITHOUT_ spf entries, it
would be against the RFC not to.

You are not alone. :) The rebuttal is that it doesn't make sense to
merge non-arrays, so you're on the hook to make sure you pass in valid
arguments.

         I may be preaching to the choir but at the heart of math and
computer science is the concept that all sets include a null (or
empty set). In CS this equates to all values, unless explicated
prohibited, include a null value. Is

$A = array();

not a valid array even though null?

It is, and if you use array_merge with an empty array like the one above,
the results will be as expected. The whole confusion around array_merge is
regarding passing parameters that are non arrays. In php 4, these would
just be disregarded, while in PHP 5 the function will return NULL (an
undefined variable).

Also, keep in mind that array() is different from NULL. The first one
represents an empty array, while the latter is a variable that has no
value.

Greets fellow PHPers,

          This is something I've been looking around for but bit hard
pressed to find something on the net.  Anyone know a function call or
method to determine how much memory in bytes your script variables(any
type) are currently using?

Bah. Sorry. I read too quickly. I missed "variables" in there.

The function memory_get_usage() is what you're looking for.

If you are on *NIX and execute the script from the command line then you
can run top or `ps aux | grep myscriptname `  and see the mem usage for
that process.

This won't give you the variable mem footprint but it will give you a
general idea of resources being used.

If you are on unix and you want more specifics try looking up by  
process id:

   $pid = getmypid();
   $memusage=`ps --pid $pid --no-headers -ovsize,rss,size`;

Subject: [nycphp-talk] filename for forced download
Message-ID: <6.2.3.4.2.20060519210616.02523920@mail.optonline.net>

I have run into a problem with the default filename of a 
forced-download file, on (of course) Internet Explorer. The script 
works perfectly, and on smart browsers like Firefox or Opera or 
Mozilla the default filename is indeed the name of the incoming file, 
as it should be.  But on IE the name is defaulting to _download 
(which may be a reflection of the fact that the operative script is 
named _download.php), even though the Disposition header is correctly 
(according to my tests) naming the file.  Here are those headers:
============
header( "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" );
header( "Content-Length: $fsize" );
header( "Content-Type: application/force-download" );
header( "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$fname" );
header( "Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary" );
============
Now in fact the file is not binary, so possibly the encoding should 
not be binary (advice?), but surely that has nothing to do with the 
default name problem. Any ideas on how I can force the correct name 
into IE?  Thanks in advance.

Two things ..

Never did this but, what happens if you quote out the filename,  
anything?
header( "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"$fname\"" );

Also what version of IE?  This had been noted to be a security issue  
in regards to spoofing in previous editions and seems their quickfix  
was to do something like this.

You can try "application/octet-stream" w/ the needed extension to see  
if the save dialog prompts the correct filename.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Are SDO objects "REST"-ful?
Message-ID: <37D9C3CC-7D46-4DB1-8900-831779A7016A@jonbaer.com>

After going through PDO -> Zend_DB* classes I came across the IBM SDO  
presentation and was wondering if SDO was meant to place RESTful CRUD  
methods inside of objects and if it was going to be (or something  
similar) included w/ the Zend Framework?

Or did I completely misunderstand the SDO concept?

Between all of them there seems to be some repeating methods so Id  
like to understand the idea better.

Hi all.

I've solved the problem after intensive browsing of Mysql.com forums.

Does anyone know if a c compiler comes with OS X. I accessed the FreeBSD
core through a shell terminal, but I couldn't find a c compiler like gcc, cc
or cpp.

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Peter,

You need to install the Developer Tools package off of the OSX DVD-ROM
-- it has all of the additional binaries that make up a traditional
BSD system.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] no tunderstanding preg_grep behavior
Message-ID: <12212-87770@sneakemail.com>

I have a string of html, and inside are a few phone numbers. I used preg_split to split the string into tags and their contents, and am using preg_grep on that array to find phone numbers. It works fine... except I don't understand why the results array from preg_grep is not just the matches but the entire array plus 2 more (the matches) (?).

I doubt I can recreate a decent regex inside this email, but basically it's just 

$mystring='
<strong>Exxon Mobil</strong><br>refinery inventory<br>empty orders<br>Verona, NJ 07044<br>973-432-0277<br>973-439-4877 (fax)<br>Washington Mutual Insurance<br>
';

//one line per tag or content
$pattern = '/(<(?:[^<>]+(?:"[^"]*"|\'[^\']*\')?)+>)/';
$html_array = preg_split ('/(<(?:[^<>]+(?:"[^"]*"|\'[^\']*\')?)+>)/', trim ($mystring), -1, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE | PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);


$phone = preg_grep("/^\D*(\d{3})\D*(\d{3})\D*(\d{4})\D*(\d*)$/", $html_array);

If you examine $phone, it has all of the html_array and then the twophonenumbers found, properly keyed. 

Thanks for helping me understand this. I expected thelength of $phone to be num_matches, and the first element to be the first phone number found.  Oops.

As always happpens, just when you look for help the problem goes away 
(?)  I suppose it's an error in the pattern, although I still don't see it.

Eddy,

Long time no chat. This is a very tough question. I have been unable to find 
an internal PHP function to help with this. After playing with many 
different things we have been running callgrind/valgrind and with that you 
can start to piece together the details of the memory usage of your 
application. These dumps can be a broad confusing read, but there is a 
graphical front end that helps make things easier. It has been a while but I 
think we got a good picture of memory allocation with those tools.

There is also xdebug, but I think that just gives total memory allocation.

Later,
Jeff

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Are SDO objects "REST"-ful?

Hi Jon,  some answers to your questions regarding SDO, REST and the Zend
Framework.  I hope this helps clarify things.  Let me know if you have any
more questions.

SDO's are not intended to contain any business methods, including CRUD.
They are a data structure that is designed for working with data from
various data sources, such as databases or XML.  They can optionally track
modifications which have been made to them, but this is for database
concurrency support rather than REST.

There are currently no plans to include SDO in the Zend Framework.

I only mention the following to help clarify the scope of SDO, and identify
areas of possible future interest:
Related to SDO is a technology called SCA (Service Component Architecture -
see http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/ws-sca/ ).
This describes how to create Web services which can be implemented using
SDOs for the data structures.  REST style services are within the scope of
SCA, but are not currently covered by it.  Also, there is currently no PHP
implementation of SCA :-(


Regards,

Graham.

Hi there y'all:

I'm a developer who works within his own publishing framework.  I 
have developed a few e-commerce sites in the past, but I have one 
upcoming that might benefit from some kind of drop-in solution.

So, I am researching what is available.

I was wondering if anyone had used a good solution that provides a 
bunch of nice things, but without screwing up an existing publishing 
framework.  I'm thinking of things like handling ordering, and so 
forth, but then also providing reporting.  The kind of thing I would 
have to code on my own.

The thing is, I don't desire to have some PHP store thing take over 
the rest of our project; the site is more than just a store, and we 
don't want constraints on the rest of our site with respect to 
templating, etc.

Reasonable request?

Cheers,

I feel that things like this can be much more credibly handled when
instead of starting what has the potential to become a flamewar on this
list (both sides included) these kinds of responses are best given to
the delete button. simply, the person couldn't fill the position for you
and was.... blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda... POOF!!! and the problem
is gone. none of us know the extent of what happened between you and the
other person. and now instead of just ignoring this minor thing you've
created credibility issues with both companies (in my mind at least) due
to reasons my little email may reveal to you both.

    being a member of nyphp since very early on I've watched a lot of
communications on this list. I'm up in albany and get very little chance
to see the people on here so i base my opinions solely on what i read
from an individuals postings and work as does everyone else to a degree.
This said as a suggestion i'd say "dont let things blow up in your face
when all you needed to do was filter or delete." flame wars can only
make alot of things worse and degrade the lists quality. please try not
to do this kind of email here - i've got a politcs list that's great for
flame wars - but believe me they can be tough at times. but that's not
here - that's there. i hope what i said here makes a bit of sense if not
- email me offlist and ask me any questions (dan a danhorning.com)
thanks folks.

Personally, I think you should check out two projects:

OSCommerce
http://www.oscommerce.com/

PHPCard
http://www.phpcart.com/

IMHO, OSCommerce is one of the best ways to go. It's easily
customizable, can handle multiple forms of payment, and is stable.
PHPCart, I've never used but have heard good things about it.

At least to me, OScommerce is not at all easy to customize
Zencart was based off an OScommerce release and then developed over the 
past few years to be easier to use
I haven't yet tried it, but I will on my next ecommerce project

I've used oscommerce itermittently over the past couple years and I
find it completely unacceptable in terms of customizing and making it
useful in general.  It's funny though, once you start playing with an
install, you'll start to notice all the small ecommerce places out
there that use it.

Zencart is a fork of OSC and is a pretty significant step up.  I still
haven't been completely satisfied with it, but it offers things like a
password-protected admin page!  What a concept.  I've also heard some
positive things about "Creloaded" which seems to be a fork of ZC...
yes, a fork of a fork.

A friend of mine recently got into XCart ($300, iirc) and is quite
happy with it.  I haven't done anything with it yet, but if it's half
as theme-able as OSC and ZC, then I'm going to seriously consider
it...

CREloaded is just OScommerce loaded with a bunch of "contributions" 
(add-ons)
Probably good if you were going to use OSc and do the add-ons yourself
With CRE, I assume all the contribs were tested, loaded, tweaked, but I 
don't know for sure

I have used Joomla with the VirtueMart plugin to build several ecommerce 
sites. And Joomla provides a nice backend for managing products and content.

Eggceptional conclusion.

Those chickens-researchers are outstanding in their field.

But, we are still left with the question "Which came first, the 1 or the 0?"

Interesting article about zero.  I was truly surprised to read that zero did
not come into widespread until the 1600's.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] utf8 woes - is there a UTF string unencoder ?
Message-ID: <31882-79589@sneakemail.com>

I have a mixed app in development where some data is utf8 and some is ... well... not utf8 :-)

I have some spaces reported to be %A0 (non-breaking space in utf8) and it's messing up my lookups... it's obviously not a match for the "normal" PHP space character.

What to do? I can do a preg_replace on the urlencoded string and then unencode, but that is ridiculous to me. 

Thanks for any help.   -=john

It sounds like utf8_decode() might be useful to you:

http://php.net/utf8_decode

It converts a string where some characters are encoded as UTF-8 to 
single-byte ISO-8859-1.

Hope that helps.

Though this slight digression from the riveting original topic is so
