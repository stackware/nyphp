Subject: [nycphp-talk] dot equal
Message-ID: <CAA3pqsK5F90ESF=-GEo7w-bEBm_8xq-Ersb-UcPtuwGwzVKTog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to run existing php source on Xen VM using Centos64.  I seem to
be having trouble with the dot equal (.=) string operator.  Is there some
way to turn this on in php.ini?  I keep getting errors in my code right
where a string gets appended using this shorthand.  If there is no such
setting, them perhaps this is a bug in php?  Please help!

Thanks,
Nick

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv-v7096KfPCmuo7cB6UVmDF80XiS6MZd4hVtaOH_HStBQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing an application in PHP which does a SOAP request. But the
problem is that the request is slow at times. It ca take 5-6 seconds to get
a SOAP response sometimes. I've considered caching the data and poll to get
it. But then I wondered what to do with the data once I get it with respect
to performance concerns. It's it better to write the 20 records to a file
or a MySQL TABLE?  I considered MySQL cause it would make the programming
job easier to use it for retrieval, but that's just my personal
preference. Or does it make any difference? The final result will be
displayed on a web page and don't want to keep the short-attention span
user waiting.

Or I should just go to the fair today and not worry about it? :-)

Saving/pulling directly to disk will always be faster, but as you say, is
it worth the extra programming complexity?  I'd say it comes down to volume
- if you need to handle millions of these cached files, then concocting
something to save to disk or even memory/memcache could be optimal.  But if
the traffic is low, then in either case there probably won't be much
difference, aside from complexity and bugs :)

Actually, I take this back - it sucks.  I just had the honor of setting up
Ubuntu for a project... I had to Google to find out how to get a command
line prompt in it's UI, and then sort through the Amazon/MP3/etc
advertisements on the desktop it installed.  Not to mention the 25% usage
when idle so that it could draw all the pretty pictures for ads.

Sorry, just had to rant a bit :)

I haven't actually setup Ubuntu since the advertizing thing happened. That
does suck. Why not do a text install and then add your favorite window
environment? The CPU usage is disappointing considering Unity's original
incarnation was in the lighweight "netbook respin" of Ubuntu, which BTW was
an awesome release.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] The Diff Meetings
Message-ID: <CACGAZnJLp0GZp3+=3AsGmd2Te6c+hrDGciMPSPRiexD0_kA1NA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I thought it prudent to pull topics from the git vs svn thread for planning
out some future meetings.

Here's the recap:

There's always new technology on the web and some of it certainly could be
considered wonderful, and some simply hype... of course, this pattern in
technology (or anything really) is nothing new.

What if we compiled a list, added the pros/cons of each, and debated it out
panel style at a meeting?

I'll happily seed the list: )

git / github
LESS/etc (compiled CSS)
AJAX
jQuery
Bootstrap (CSS frameworks)
noSQL
Cloud servers
RoR
nodeJS
Cloud development (online code editors/etc)

What am I forgetting? Oh right...

Responsive design :)

Previously, some topics such as OOP and MVC were introduced.  While these
are certainly valid topics, and often deserve meetings of their own, I
think we should focus purely on the new "hot topics" of late.

So, in the interest of getting some meetings planned:

-- any new/trendy topics to add to the list above?

-- anyone ready to talk about their preferred side of the diff?  Say... for
instance, git vs svn ? :)

-- those who step-up, let's discuss and we can plan a couple of meetings
for the fall.

I find it depends on what it is your running and how willing you are to
compile programs from scratch.

I've consistently found the CentOS PHP package to be badly out of date,
which initially led me to using Ubuntu.   However, just one package is not
a good reason to switch, as it is not that hard to compile it from scratch.

However, in the past when dealing with image processing and website
processing, I found so many packages downlevel that I ended up sticking
with Ubuntu.
Imagemagick was a big one where Ubuntu was preferable...especially if you
want to do liquid rescaling[though perhaps CentOS has caught up?]

wkhtmltopdf was a major pain in that even when I compiled it from source,
it had a lot of dependencies on various software package versions which led
me down a rabbit hole of compiling packages.

Postfix is another package where Ubuntu simply has the edge if you want to
play with the some of the more recent features.

At the same time though, the security benefits of CentOS are large - so it
can be better to deploy a mixed environment - use Ubuntu for development
and as specific process services[ie ship all your image processing off to a
Ubuntu box only reachable from the web servers] and use CentOS for
deployment.  When you run into version dependencies going from dev to
production, you can make a case by case decision on whether to compile
everything you need or use web services and export that function to a
Ubuntu box.

As an independent developer, I use Ubuntu as my preference as it saves me
time when dealing with later features.

Just cache the results in a JSON file, that's the easier solution to your
problem and the faster to implement.

You don't need to install the UI for a server.  However, I agree entirely
that since around 12.04/12.10 the Ubuntu desktop has become a bloated pile
of crud.  I especially disliked their "smart search" function which would
go out and search the internet and display ads for stuff at the same time
as it searched the local drive...all I wanted to do was find "Thunderbird"
 on the local system, I didn't need half a dozen ads for music relating to
that keyword - and I certainly didn't need the performance drag!


For desktop use, I switched to Linux Mint Mate.   It is based on Ubuntu,
but it replaces their CPU intensive "Unity" desktop environment with a
modern version of "Gnome" which has a decent amount of eye candy without
impacting performance.   For those that really want the eye candy, Linux
Mint Cinnamon gives you that and still performs better.

They're all terrible. Just handle process priority, memory management, and
open some sockets when asked. For the rest... stay out of the way. For
god's sake don't try to maintain a "system" java that symlinks to the
flavor of the month. Don't provide shared libraries. Don't provide printing
services. Don't even install cron.

Just as the BIOS is a thin layer which is just meant to provide a uniform
interface to the hardware should be the OS to higher level memory, storage,
and network resources.

This is too extreme a position to take, but it's the tendency I lean
towards in reaction to the overloading of crap which is inevitable in OS's
that maintain both a desktop and server userbase. It's the unfortunate
reality that we really MUST have desktop users in order to find all of the
bugs and get enough of an audience to provide constant development... so I
know I'm preaching to an impossible end.... if any end at all.

Yes, I would use your distro. I might install cron, but I get to choose

Seriously, Hans, maybe your client wanted to use Ubuntu Server because of
the GUI, but you should know better than to have a window manager running
on a production server. I suppose you'd let the OS automount any USB keys
that were stuck into the front ports, too?

Easy there Chris, didn't realize Ubuntu was your project...

Obviously I can customize my OS how I'd like... and I'm sure Ubuntu would
be just as happy to mount a USB stick and scan it for MP3s while giving me
Amazon ads... and we can all choose which OS/flavor we use... and I'm
simply stating, that Ubuntu will never be my choice.

Sorry for mangling the history with my mail client.

Chris, Hans, I never made the leap myself, but isn't much of this why you 
two advocate/d the BSDs for AMP development? What's the reason for either 
of you considering Ubuntu/CentOS today? 

As consultants, I understand you have to deal with some legacy client 
infrastructure and may not be able to define the "ideal OS" but what would 
you use if you had it your way?

And I don't mean to start a religious war, but if you were to set up a 
server only cluster of VMs to serve up your own production PHP apps, what 
would you choose today and why? 

How much do you really care to influence what choices are made at the OS 
or PHP version level? What are the make/break configurations you 
absolutely must have control over?

I guess I really should run a poll for this, but for others on the list, 
where do you fit into the the following spectrum?

1. I fully control hardware (virtualize yourself, if needed) and 
build/package install AMP yourself.
2. I select an OS image on a cloud IaaS (EC2, etc) and build/package 
install AMP yourself.
3. I use choose a pre-built AMP stack image on an IaaS.
4. I use Zend phpcloud or one of the production PaaSes for it (IBM, 
RightScale, etc), or another PaaS like Azure, Heroku, Cloud Foundry, etc
5. I go with a SaaS (WordPress, SugarCRM, Drupal) provider and customize 
that.

Hello all,


I thought it prudent to pull topics from the git vs svn thread for planning out some future meetings.


Here's the recap:


There's always new technology on the web and some of it certainly could be considered wonderful, and some simply hype... of course, this pattern in technology (or anything really) is nothing new.


What if we compiled a list, added the pros/cons of each, and debated it out panel style at a meeting?


I'll happily seed the list: )


git / github
LESS/etc (compiled CSS)

AJAX

jQuery

Bootstrap (CSS frameworks)

noSQL
Cloud servers
RoR

nodeJS

Cloud development (online code editors/etc)



What am I forgetting? Oh right...


Responsive design :)


Previously, some topics such as OOP and MVC were introduced.  While these are certainly valid topics, and often deserve meetings of their own, I think we should focus purely on the new "hot topics" of late.


So, in the interest of getting some meetings planned:


-- any new/trendy topics to add to the list above?


-- anyone ready to talk about their preferred side of the diff?  Say... for instance, git vs svn ? :)


-- those who step-up, let's discuss and we can plan a couple of meetings for the fall.

I made the switch from FreeBSD to Debian a few years ago (okay, 10 years
ago now, jeez) because my employer was wedded to DELL hardware and Linux
seemed to play more nicely with it. Also, apt-get was just too easy to
ignore. I created a few meta packages that would patch a minimal install
with exactly what I needed, including a hand-compiled PHP.

When EC2 became available, I wanted to switch back, but FreeBSD wasn't
supported at the time. Debian's ever-more-complicated filesystem is causing
me to rethink whether I stick with it long-term.

The ideal OS would be something like MediaTemple's Grid Service, or
Google's App Engine, where someone else is managing the infrastructure and
underlying OS, and you get an isolated container with guaranteed resource
allocation plus on-demand scaling. Virtualization, but with only the
userland virtualized.

PHP extensions allow magic to happen.

I guess the main thing, if you're planning to provide this kind of
environment, is not to give clients control over things like installed
packages and extensions and PHP configurations - - that's just asking for
trouble, and could be used by a noob or attacker to destabilize system or
break out of whatever jail you have them in.

But do give clients the ability to request these things and make the system
flexible enough that it's easy for your sysadmins to grant reasonable
requests. I don't need control over whether Zip is enabled in PHP, but if I
need it to be able to work with .xlsx files, then you need to be able to
turn it on for me. Does that make sense?

One reason why I run Gentoo for my *personal* stuff.

Interesting question. Imagine running your stack directly on a VM with
no OS. This is what the Erlang on Xen project is doing. Shame its not
PHP (intrigued enough to read up on Erlang though :-)

Looked at Heroku? A long time ago I looked at it as Ruby only
infrastructure but they seem to have expanded into other langiuages when
I wasn't looking.

Why did you install a UI?

Last time I ran desktop Linux it was Xubuntu (XFCE is very very light).

Mainly that some--but not all--shared libraries are being moved from
/usr/lib into /usr/lib/<arch>, which makes hand-compiling a bit more
difficult.

Or take a look at how a package like mailman, which is really meant to
reside in a single directory, is spread all over the system:

cd /var/lib/mailman/
aws:/var/lib/mailman# ls -l

drwxrwsr-x  4 root list 4096 2011-04-26 12:17 tests

I understand the logic behind the decisions about where to put stuff -- the
use of /var/lib versus /usr/lib, etc. But as a personal preference I would
rather it was simpler. It's not like I have /usr and /var on separate
partitions, disk space is abundant, even on SSDs.

I've always liked CentOS/RedHat and honestly FreeBSD started getting
strange.  BSD's were always generally a bit behind with certain libraries
and incompatibilities, but after FreeBSD 4 and into 5, etc., things just
seemed to get ever more broken.

And now it's just not offered and there's no compelling reason to request
it.  Amazon's CentOS flavor is pretty well done and minimal, and for
instances I need to install my own, I have a 700mb server image ready to go.

At the end of the day, though, there's really only one reason though: Cloud
killed the BSD star...

CentOS
Windows Server
Anything else

I have an increasing number of clients using the WISP stack, which actually
works quite nicely.

Today:  EC2 and Azure (maybe)

Tomorrow: GAE PHP

I've been playing with GAE PHP and it's nice... it's nascent and needs some
maturing, but it's clearly the way forward.  The biggest challenge that I
see for "legacy" apps is the classic PHP extension rot problem, i.e., XYZ
isn't available.  But for newer applications, that aren't quite as
extension promiscuous, it's going to be great.

How much do you really care to influence what choices are made at the OS or

If it's an existing stack, I'll basically support anything.  If I'm
building from the ground up, it's barebones CentOS, compiled PHP/etc.
I've even documented it: http://www.framewire.org/stacks

I guess I really should run a poll for this, but for others on the list,

Cloud computing:  first the network didn't matter; then the server
hardware; now the OS; and soon the application

We're considering migrating our college website (currently plone) to drupal (another option is OU Campus from

I've got pro and con opinions about Drupal but the cons are mostly
related to people using a CMS where a non-CMS choice probably would have
worked better.  I run, develop for or maintain about a dozen Drupal
sites and overall I've been happy with it.  But it's got a steep and
very rocky learning curve.

I don't know how many Drupal developers hang out here but there are
active developer communities on drupal.org:

https://groups.drupal.org/groups

NYC group: https://groups.drupal.org/nyc

Yeah that's a good one... Apache/mod_php vs FastCGI

Any one else?

H

git / github

LESS/etc (compiled CSS)

AJAX

jQuery

Bootstrap (CSS frameworks)

noSQL

Cloud servers

RoR

nodeJS

Cloud development (online code editors/etc)


What am I forgetting? Oh right...


Responsive design :)

Thanks so very much for the very helpful response; I'll definitely check into the resources you've pointed me towards.

One follow-up (about the steep and rocky learning curve) question:  Does this entry barrier apply also to end users?  As 
far as I'm concerned, steep and rocky learning curves are par for the course among those of us who do development work, 
but if (after our initial work has mostly been completed) the tasks of creating/editing content, and publishing/approval 
workflows still require some minimal "expert" level of knowledge, that's likely to be a show-stopper here.

     thanks again,
            ~c

Have not used drupal in a long time, but you may also look into MODX, I used
it a few times, very easy to implement and maintain.

That's one of the reasons why I used MODX for those projects, after the
implementation was done, it was a simple interface for end users to edit /
maintain their information.

Once you get familiar with Drupal's templating system, CCK, Views, third
party modules and the hook override architecture things like this are
easy to build for Drupal and are extremely flexible.

"Once you get familiar..." is easy to say though.

Drupal 7 is the right way to do it, don't use OU Campus from Omni-Update,
I just did it for my college, 
You need 
feeds modules for content migration from old sites, 
views modules integrated with other modules for most db query, use directly
db_query as less as possible,
Apache solr for all search,
Boost, varnish, memche, apc for cache, performace,
gather and interpret your requirements into your architecture.
ldap, or shib sso for auth and authorization,

Hope this help,

Shawn

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9F=SBLk4_3zdod2K7=jRnM+7TtD28HAVhhr8wtL7M5-A@mail.gmail.com>

I'm getting these in the log on CentOS 6.4 a couple of times a week:

EDAC MC0: CE page 0x9521e, offset 0xb00, grain 128, syndrome 0x49, row 2,
channel 1, label "": i3000 CE
EDAC MC0: CE page 0x9521e, offset 0xb00, grain 128, syndrome 0x49, row 2,
channel 1, label "": i3000 CE
EDAC MC0: CE page 0x9521e, offset 0xb00, grain 128, syndrome 0x49, row 2,

EDAC MC0: CE page 0x9521e, offset 0xb00, grain 128, syndrome 0x49, row 2,
channel 1, label "": i3000 CE

If I'm correct, this means there is a problem with a memory module. What
I'm not clear on, is how to determine from this what row 2, channel 1
refers to. The Dell server this is running on has four memory slots. Anyone
have a way for me to equate this information from the logs to determine
which memory slot this is referring to?

The error message is intermittent so removing RAM in an attempt to isolate
which memory stick or slot is having the problem hasn't been useful. Thanks!

The dmidecode command will likely help in this case. I'm assuming you don't
have drac set up for remote hardware analysis, in the future it or its
little brother ipmi will be helpful.

This is likely not a php question.

Not that I'm looking for a job right now, but there's always the future. Is
there a reasonably common scale for saying how good you are with a
programming language? Something more than "Rate yourself on a 1-10" scale.

In my case I can read several and am trying to improve a couple. It would
be nice to be able to concretely convey my skills. Of course, that doesn't
really cover related skills like version control, SDLC, etc...

Thoughts?

Not sure, but there was a time when I wanted to improve 3 languages at once
for an interview and came up with a scheme to test myself. Something along
the lines of percentage of the standard library one can recite from
scratch, and implementing the same set of algorithms and data structures
without looking at the documentation.

A rating scale implies that there's a way to objectively measure skills 
across developers. Programming skills are very subjective, and as you say, 
don't really touch on the process and soft skills around delivering good 
software.

What about setting up a public GitHub repository with sample code to refer 
potential clients too? They can see your code quality, competence with 
source control, and passion for programming.

If you want to convey your skills, a cert or a brainbench is probably the
way to go. Certs aren't perfect, but they will tell you how much of a
language you know.

If you want something more holistic, its probably best to contribute to a
mature existing open source project. This allows you to say:

   1. My code is useful
   2. Others have seen my code and found it acceptable to include with
   theirs
   3. I have demonstrated something useful with X aspects of a language

Hehe...I have a project on SourceForge (
https://sourceforge.net/projects/techdiveplanner) and a couple on GitHub (
https://github.com/LeamHall). Considering they are "warts and all", that
might be why I haven't gotten any programming job offers.  :)

Having projects is great for the team interview but not as good for
evaluating the job notes or getting past HR. And sort of difficult to get
feedback so that I can grow. Contributing to mature or larger projects
seems difficult as it presupposes more skill and a deeper understanding of
that particular project.

For example, I really enjoy PHP but my day job doesn't use it. So I find
myself pulled towards Bash on a daily basis and secretly trying to figure
out how to convert it to something better.

Leam
