<PRE>If you want to use mysql, you might want to look into the
mod_auth_mysql for apache. That may be a cleaner approach instead of
having your scripts create the .htpasswd and .htaccess files.

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if any of you knew of a PHP-script (either open source
</I>&gt;<i> or commercially-licensed) that helps one do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> - Password protect all files or select files in a directory using
</I>&gt;<i> .htaccess files
</I>&gt;<i> - The information in the .htaccess files will be written when the user
</I>&gt;<i> selects the files (or directories) to be password protected, and then
</I>&gt;<i> adds a username and password that correspond to those protected resources
</I>&gt;<i> - Some user info, such as last login date and time and email will be
</I>&gt;<i> stored in a MySQL database
</I>&gt;<i> - When  the administrator adds a new user (thus allowing the new user to
</I>&gt;<i> access a specific directory or set of files), that user's info is stored
</I>&gt;<i> in the MySQL database and the username and password info is also written
</I>&gt;<i> to a .htaccess file. (In this case the admin either chooses a new
</I>&gt;<i> password for the user, or one is randomly created by the system.)
</I>&gt;<i> - At this time, the user is also emailed with a note saying something
</I>&gt;<i> like: &quot;John has added you as a member. Your username is <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">john at aol.com</A>,
</I>&gt;<i> your password is 4rgf567u. Log-in at <A HREF="http://www.somewebsite.com">http://www.somewebsite.com</A> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - An access log should be available, showing who logged in last and when
</I>&gt;<i> - Users should be able to add short notes to a guestbook that is visible
</I>&gt;<i> to other users
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This system should also be able to work with an existing website that is
</I>&gt;<i> full of static .html files. The reason .htaccess seems the best tool for
</I>&gt;<i> this job is that the potential client already has a boat-load of static
</I>&gt;<i> content that is to be protected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, since the potential client is on a tight budget, the only
</I>&gt;<i> option seems to be to buy a PHP script that does all of this and
</I>&gt;<i> customize the script as necessary for the client. This will take much
</I>&gt;<i> less time than writing it from scratch, and thus fit into this person's
</I>&gt;<i> budget. I don't might writing this from scratch (in which case I would
</I>&gt;<i> use the htaccess class from pear.php.net ) - but the thing is writing it
</I>&gt;<i> from scratch takes longer than just installing and customizing an
</I>&gt;<i> existing script.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I came across the following product from cgi-city.com:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.cgi-city.com/authpro/demo.shtml">http://www.cgi-city.com/authpro/demo.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is written in Perl, though, which is a bit denser than PHP, and a bit
</I>&gt;<i> harder to work with (my opinion only).
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, it is simply TOO feature rich, and the potential client
</I>&gt;<i> will likely not have a clue as to how to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any suggestions on how to proceed, or can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> suggest an appropriate third-party script?
</I>&gt;<i> I searched sourceforge for &quot;htaccess&quot; and came up with a few things, but
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure those scripts are good or easily customizable. If it is a
</I>&gt;<i> commercial script, I could only use it if the source code is not encoded
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. is modifyable, even if I am not allowed to redistribute it.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another easier idea occured to me, but it involved mod_rewrite. I have
</I>&gt;<i> not used mod_rewrite before, but I have read about it. If anyone can
</I>&gt;<i> help me with the following mod_rewrite rule, I would be most grateful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the idea:
</I>&gt;<i> - Suppose the client's website is www.abc123.com
</I>&gt;<i> - The client has files such as www.abc123.com/one.html and
</I>&gt;<i> www.abc123.com/two.html that need to be password protected
</I>&gt;<i> - All current .html files are moved from the root web directory to a
</I>&gt;<i> sub-directory called &quot;protected&quot;. This directory is protected by a
</I>&gt;<i> single set of  .htaccess username and password that is only available to
</I>&gt;<i> the administrator
</I>&gt;<i> - The administrator logs into the control panel and whitelists all file
</I>&gt;<i> or selected files from the &quot;protected&quot; directory to be
</I>&gt;<i> processed/included later (by mod_rewrite and a PHP script). This
</I>&gt;<i> whitelist info is stored in a MySQL table
</I>&gt;<i> - A mod_rewrite rule is written to say the following: all .html files
</I>&gt;<i> accessed from www.abc123.com are rerouted to the following file for
</I>&gt;<i> processing: www.abc123.com/load.php?page=chosenpage.html
</I>&gt;<i> - The load.php page checks to see if the requested file exists in the
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL file whitelist.
</I>&gt;<i> - If a user is logged-in, it includes the file. If not, it prompts the
</I>&gt;<i> user to log-in.
</I>&gt;<i> - The log-in is performed using the PEAR Auth class. The username and
</I>&gt;<i> password info (along with user email and last login info) is stored in a
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL table.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of this approach is that one is not dealing with messy
</I>&gt;<i> .htaccess files. Additionally, there is no duplication of username and
</I>&gt;<i> password data as in the previous case - where the username and password
</I>&gt;<i> were being stored both in .htaccess files and in a MySQL database. Thus
</I>&gt;<i> all info is in a MySQL database, and works with existing static files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The user can continue to use Frontpage (or whatever) to modify static
</I>&gt;<i> files, and simply upload them to the &quot;protected&quot; directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know of a mod_rewrite rule to do the rewriting described in
</I>&gt;<i> step 5 above?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this second method is more complication, but I am interested in
</I>&gt;<i> hearing feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Jay
