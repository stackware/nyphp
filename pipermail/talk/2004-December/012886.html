This will almost always happen because PHP Mag is located in Germany. It 
takes me two months to get their issues.

php|a comes a bit quicker to me, but I still get it a month after it's 
been released. For example, I just received the November 2004 issue 
yesterday, but the December issue is already out. (I'm located in 
Atlanta, so I guess it takes longer to get to me.)

Needless to say, I'm a bit upset with the delay in receiving both of 
these publications, but there's not much I can do about that.

Since each magazine competes with the other, they try to stay on top of 
news and latest trends. So, content-wise they're both pretty good. Both 
use well-known speakers, writers, bloggers, and developers for their 
material. I also have spoken to the editors of both publications, and 
they're both great people who are seeking the best possible content for 
the community.

I think it may come to this for you: PHP Mag is published bi-monthly (6 
issues a year), whereas php|architect is published monthly. So, it may 
come down to how many issues you want for your money. Still, if budget 
would allow for both, I'd say to get both.
