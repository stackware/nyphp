I've cut-and-pasted some repartee from Bruce Perens...I thought his last 
comment about &quot;Slashdot readership&quot; was particularly poignant :)



  It's a threading issue (Score:5, Interesting)

Either PHP itself, or many PHP applications, are not written to deal 
with the multi-threading offered by Apache 2.0 . So, it seems, you will 
do best if you install one of the less optimal threading models. And 
then you lose much of the benefit of Apache 2.

Apache 2 and a recent Linux kernel come pretty close to the theoretical 
limits of the hardware when it comes to serving static content. It just 
loafs along while saturating whatever net connection you give it. It's 
worth trying out.

       It's not nearly late enough in the thread for someone respected 
to post correct, non-inflamatory, rational information. You're going to 
stop all the foaming at the mouth, and who wants a half-frothed troll 
this close to Christmas?

             It's OK because I didn't read any of the articles linked to 
in the Slashdot story before posting. Thus, I maintain the proper level 
of ignorance for Slashdot.

             On the other hand, I had looked at the problem reasonably 
hard when choosing supported software for UserLinux, so I did know 
something about the problem. So perhaps that disqualifies me.
