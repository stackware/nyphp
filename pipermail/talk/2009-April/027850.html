<PRE>Found it.

This was a website that I was told was being recognized by some employers as
verifying experience.

I don't know how much stock I'd put in it though.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] W3 Schools?

What always got me in the door was a Computer Science degree from
UC-Berkeley.

That seemed to help.  As an employer, I'd be looking for a combination of
education and number of years of direct experience.  Five years is
considered an even exchange for an education by some employers.

There was a different website and no one I either met or heard about had
used their test results as a way to document their knowledge.  I may have
heard this from a headhunter.  From what I understood, it actually worked.

As an employer, I would put much stock in it.

But, if I can remember the website, I'll forward the link.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] W3 Schools?

Anyone have any experience with the W3 Schools tutorials and 
Certification? The site has a lot of tutorials and look decently well 
written. Testing for a cert is $75, and I'm not sure if it's going to 
affect any hiring decisions but it does let us &quot;externally motivated&quot; 
folks test ourselves against a measurable standard.

Since I'm not yet in the PHP Rock Star ranks, do you think this might help?
