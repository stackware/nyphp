<PRE>A quick google search for &quot;windows run process in background&quot; yielded:

&quot;In case anyone has this problem in future, I finally found out the
solution. The START command in Windows command line allows you to
start another command window running any command; and the /B option
can start the command without the extra command window, so you get
similar behavior to Unix's background processes. Look it up for more
details.&quot;

I don't use windows, but I trigger background processes with and &quot;&amp;&quot;
in *nix, and it looks like windows offers the same functionality with
&quot;start /b&quot;

John Campbell

&gt;<i> Hi experienced and talented community of which I have been trolling for a
</I>&gt;<i> few years!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a question for all of you and I hope this makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, the background. I am coding a PHP Web application that has to call a
</I>&gt;<i> external program, however, because only one instance of the program can be
</I>&gt;<i> ran at a time I need to implement a queue. In addition, it is important the
</I>&gt;<i> users need to not wait (keep the browser open) for their job to process. The
</I>&gt;<i> script will send them an e-mail with a link after their job completes. This
</I>&gt;<i> means I need something to persistently run whenever there is something in
</I>&gt;<i> the queue. In summary: front end script calls secondary child which runs
</I>&gt;<i> until queue is empty by calling external program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is, I cannot figure out how to properly fork under Windows,
</I>&gt;<i> allowing the parent script to run to completion, and not hang the browser
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for the child to complete. I am at the point where I can spawn the
</I>&gt;<i> child and it will run even when the parent browser is closed but will not
</I>&gt;<i> release the parent script until it completes. I have tried exec(), system(),
</I>&gt;<i> shell_exec(), popen(), and a COM call (which I might have done wrong). Each
</I>&gt;<i> of those called php -f childScript.php.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about a few other alternatives:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Use a scheduled task to check for a queue at a set interval. This is the
</I>&gt;<i> least desired solution as it could cause unwanted delay.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Write a PHP daemon/Win32 service to monitor a queue of which could be
</I>&gt;<i> queried and started if needed by parent script and it would run until the
</I>&gt;<i> queue is empty at which time it would shutdown.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Write a Perl script to be called by the parent which would fork and call
</I>&gt;<i> the secondary PHP script, subsequently terminating and releasing the parent
</I>&gt;<i> PHP script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - WAMP environment, cannot use Linux as external program is Windows only
</I>&gt;<i> (BUMMER!)
</I>&gt;<i> - Need a queue to handle calls to an external program, currently stored in a
</I>&gt;<i> flat file
</I>&gt;<i> - Parent script needs to fork to a child script which can run independent of
</I>&gt;<i> the parent until queue is empty
</I>&gt;<i> - Parent script needs to be able to complete prior to child completing
</I>&gt;<i> - Because of time required to run a job and because of the potential for
</I>&gt;<i> many users, users need to be able to submit'n'run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do any of you PHP gods (and goddesses!) have any thoughts on how to fork
</I>&gt;<i> under Windows, how to handle this situation, or alternatives? Should I be
</I>&gt;<i> using some other language? Perl, AJAX, other?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Google (or my search string) was less than helpful.
