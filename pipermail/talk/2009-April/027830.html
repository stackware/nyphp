Backticks must be interpreted as part of the script or using eval. So
because user input would be in the form of a string, the backticks
will not be interpreted.

No. I'm not joking. By &quot;garbage&quot; I mean anything so you don't need to
&quot;test&quot; it. You can safely put totally unvalidated &quot;garbage&quot; into a
database. It just needs to be escaped. Validating and escaping are two
completely different things.

&gt;<i> i admit, yes, you have to escape stuff before it gets recorded (which is
</I>&gt;<i> obvious)... but you also have to make sure that by contatenating text to
</I>&gt;<i> anything that the text does not actually *do* something if the text is
</I>&gt;<i> referenced without double quotes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> throw &lt;?php echo &quot;this is a test of `ls -al ./`&quot; . `ls -al ./`;?&gt; into a
</I>&gt;<i> file and see what happens.
</I>
That's not what the OP's code does. The OP code does the equivalent of this:

&lt;?php
$user_input = '`ls`';
echo &quot;this is a test of `ls -al ./`&quot; . $user_input;

User supplied data will be in the form of a string and therefore the
backticks will not be evaluated.

The OP code is totally harmless.
