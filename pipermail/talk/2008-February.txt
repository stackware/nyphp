I'm familiar with DOM, DHTML, JavaScript, etc but I'm not sure what
the best way to do dynamic forms is.

Basically I just want to dynamically insert or remove one element in a
form. The form is normally just a select with a submit button
immediately to it's right. But depending on what option in the select
is selected, I want another select to be inserted between the first
select and the button.

So it's either <select1><button> or <select1><select2><button>.

I would be perfectly happy with toggling the style visibility: visible
or visibility: hidden but this doesn't change the position of the
button. It always appears off to the right. I want the form to
re-pack.

Or should I use DOM calls?

What's the best, most portable way to do this?

There is likely a better way, but what I do (and I think I needed it once) is 
to simply reload the page and evaluate the submission. Ugly, but it works and 
it is definitely portable. You can either do an automatic self-submit (not 
section 508 compatible...as most of the Web2.0 stuff) or wait for the submit 
button to be clicked.

I'd create the form normally, with the optional select visible, but
the first value of the optional select list stating "Applicable only
for value XYZ". Then I'd use JavaScript to hide the optional select
list, remove the "Applicable only for value XYZ" and detect an
onchange event on the first select list for determining visibility for
the optional select list. This way, if your user is one of the 6% of
internet users without JavaScript turned on, at least the second list
will make some sense. When the request gets sent to the server, always
check both values and make sure it makes sense. I always try to
develop my web applications / forms entirely in HTML first and make
sure it works without javascript, then I add javascript where it makes
sense for a better user experience.

This note is purely a personal reflection. 

Www coders have been developing and juggling JS usability with some
seriousness at least since NS3 and IE 1 were the serious browser
platforms. In this time, no downside risk to using JS has slowed JS
spread and usage.

Over time it has become one of my hard won beliefs that it is likely
superior to cater more strongly to the 94% of users that have JavaScript
turned on and try with slick, convenient features (Ajax, Flash, Java
applets, JS, DHTML) to get a bigger share of that slice of the 94%
market than possibly to hedge a  web site's eye appeal and clickability
by deving pages for JS turned off. (Again all just IMHO.)

I feel that show/hide DOM elements is now de rigueur and SOP and has
almost single handedly helped turn web pages into the intensely
concentrated dynamite packs of information that they are now.

I vote, pour on the JS. Show/hide. Tool tips. Mouseover. And even, whoa,
inline frames.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] html 5
Message-ID: <20080201162414.GA403@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

A new version of HTML is being proposed.  Here are the changes 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-diff-20080122/.  Here are some 
highlights.

* There are "section" elements and they can have "header" and "footer" 
elements.
* There's a "nav" element.
* New "type"'s for "input" such as "datetime" and "url".
* A "type" element can be set to "autofocus".
* Form elements can be associated with more than one form.
* "script" elements can now be "async".
* Frames are gone.
* Many stylistic attributes are being yanked in favor of CSS like 
"align", "border", etc.

One major thing I like is being removed: accesskey.  This allows me (and 
other users, I suppose) to keyboard navigate through web pages and forms.  
I also see "summary" and "abbr" is being pulled from table related 
elements.  Perhpas these are being replaced with some other elements or 
attributes, but I didn't notice such in my quick look over the working 
draft.

Enjoy,

--Dan

Hi Mike,

The properties you want to mess with on <select2> are display (not 
visibility) and disabled.

var select2 = document.getElementById('select2')  // or however you want 
to go about defining select2

To turn off <select2> use something like this:
select2.style.display = 'none'; // this will collapse select2 so it 
takes up no space and is invisible
select2.disabled = true;  // not sure if this is necessary (may be 
redundant given
                        // that display = 'none'), but it will ensure 
the element is not submitted
                        // in the form.

To turn on <select2> use something like this:
select2.style.display = 'block'; // or 'inline', depending on what your 
layout.
select2.disabled = false;  // not sure if this is necessary (may be 
redundant given
                        // that display != 'none'), but it will ensure 
the element is not disabled

For more on the 'display' property, see this link: 
<http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/css/properties/classify/display.htm>  
That site is slightly dated but still incredibly useful for 
understanding CSS properties;  I've been using it as a primary reference 
for years and find it only ages in its failure to report CSS support for 
newer browsers, which is information I can get elsewhere.

Good luck,
Allen

But w/ JavaScript turned on how do I hide the select so that it no
longer occupies that space? With all elements in a row, if I set
visibility: hidden, the Submit button is off to the right where it
would be without the select hidden leaving a big gap. I want it to
shift over to the left as if there were really no select there at all.

Bingo. That is exactly what I want. It works like a champ.

So are we saying that "id" and "name" will be used in favor of
"accesskey". It was my impression that ultimately it 

was "id" that was supposed to win out as the way to address all the
elements in the DOM. Is that right?

As of a week ago, this commenter to the w3c proposal didn't notice a
replacement for accesskey either, mentioning "the deprecation of the
accesskey attribute (with no stated replacement)":
 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-comments/2008Jan/0015.h
tml>
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-comments/2008Jan/0015.h
tml>

I agree it's a major feature, and I wonder why it's being deprecated, as
I find it incredibly useful (I primarily design targeted applications,
not public Web sites).

This page points out that for public web sites there are many things
that can get in the way of accesskey definitions, namely user agents
that are already using various accesskeys for their own features, so
that there are only 3 keys out of the US-typical qwerty keyboard that
are not used (and thus effectively blocked) by at least one of these
user agents.
 <http://www.wats.ca/show.php?contentid=32>
<http://www.wats.ca/show.php?contentid=32>

Finally, this page at the w3c wiki shows some rationale from both sides
-- to include accesskeys or not.  It mentions that "An alternate,
superior mechanism can be found in the XHTML access module
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/mod-access.html#edef_access_access>
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/mod-access.html#edef_access_access>, which
supports essential semantics for accesskey navigation, but without the
device dependency restrictions of accesskey as defined in HTML 4.01.":
 <http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/DroppedAttributeAccesskey>
<http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/DroppedAttributeAccesskey>

I'm no advocate, so I likely won't be trying to make my voice heard in
any of this, but I'm quietly hoping that either accesskey is added to
the html5 spec, or that I'll be able to make use of a standardized
replacement.

jQuery for any DOM manipulation tasks like the one you describe here.

Hi Peter,

I think the discussion for accesskey is not about how to JS code to 
access the element but how to allow the user to access a form element or 
link without using the mouse or tabbing through other elements to get to 
it.

Yes. That is correct. My bad. But, further generally to this area. Then
I was thinking that in a more convoluted way one might yet be able to
use JS with onkeypress event captures, so that JS could still remain
valuable here. So that certain keyboard combination events could be
hooked to send focus to form elements by id. Plausible? Yes? No? Also,
Flash AS has access key attributes to maybe help meet this need too.

It's possible, and I suppose it's being done (it's mentioned in a few 
online references to the html5 deprecation of accesskeys). But the 
advantage of the accesskey attribute is that it works in non-JS 
environments, and that I as a developer don't have to code it. I'm 
hoping it won't come to that.

And also, it has always been my observation that tab and shift-tabbing
thru form elements is a browser level functionality employed by all. So
that an onload JS puts the user in the form then they tab it as needed.
And a hit of the enter key submits the focused submit button or even
submits the active form from any focused location in the form. 

But I believe another problem here is that readers look to accesskey
attributes to read their function or name info out to users who need
this service. So that JS, ids, and browser tabbing may still not match
what accesskey can do.

Yes, but some approaches make more sense than others.

Progressive enhancement, where the markup of the page works without
javascript, and then javascript is used to add richer functionality,
is ideal.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript

It seems like more work, since you make a functional wireframe first
and then make it all ajax-y, but it provides a necessary (imo)
separation between front- and back-end processes.

It's similar to the notion that your application should be usable (if
ugly) without css and images.

I think one of the main arguments against accesskeys is that they 
interfere with normal hotkeys in the browser and other applications. In 
particular they can cause problems with screen readers and other 
accessibility tools where being able to use crtl-A for an expected 
operation is essential. If you override that functionality to access an 
element, you have made the site useless to someone that depends on a 
certain action to access a site.

Yeah, I think that's right.  Conflicts with screen reader functions and 
browser chrome are a recurring issue with accesskeys.  This is one 
reason why this guy <http://www.wats.ca/show.php?contentid=32> was 
suggesting that accesskeys may not be especially useful except in 
intranet application or similar settings, in which you can develop for 
specific UAs.  That happens to be my situation for most projects, 
though, so the potential for such conflicts is far less of an issue for 
me than it might be for others.

Degrading gracefully is an important dev technique certainly.

Just for the sake of discussion, pulling back far to a rough massively macro level it is worth noting though that, I believe, it has been yahoo that has quietly supported this unobtrusive JS concept over the past decade while it was google that non-standardly JS'd, ajaxed, custom API'd and gadgeted their way to monster acceptance on the cool and convenience hungry 94% consumer and corporate desktops, laptops and mobiles.

Are you both using sessions and doing any redirections with header( 
'Location... (for example, after validating field content)? If so, you 
need to carry the session id along with the redirection URI or you will 
lose your session. That in and of itself will not cause duplication, but 
it can cause empty data.

This would only be true if you are using non-cookie sessions and relying 
on the session.use_trans_sid directive to pass the session id around. 
If you're using a cookie to store the session id then you don't have to 
do anything special with redirects.

Hi Mary Beth,

In my experience "mystery problems" like this one are almost always 
being done by the code itself -- some function is being called twice, or 
an ancient dummy function that was never removed is being called only in 
certain circumstances.  Unfortunately the only way to find something 
like that is to get in there and untangle the code.  You *might* get 
some clues by looking for patterns in those error cases.

On another note, it would be better for your application if this kind of 
thing doesn't happen /even if/ the page is reloaded -- that is, the 
application should be fixed to avoid repeat processing on a refresh.  
Depending on how convoluted the codebase is, this may be something you 
can add in and thereby either solve the problem or at least eliminate 
page refresh as the culprit.

Or you can add logging.  Right before the problematic query gets 
executed, log it and a backtrace using debug_backtrace().  You can even 
just log the information if the parameters to the query are empty so you 
just trap the stuff you need.  Plus have your log function email you so 
you know when to go look.

Message-ID: <47A74C6C.9020304@projectskyline.com>

Hello All,

I have a table that includes an id (not unique and a version).

A unique row is identified by both the id and version. This is for MSSQL.

I want to select all the id's, but only return the most up to date version.

So, for a table

id | version
-------------
1 | 0
1 | 1
2 | 0
2 | 1
2 | 2

The query should return

id | version
-------------
1 | 1
2 | 2

Any help much appreciated.

This problem is sometimes referred to as the group-wise maximum.  I'm 
not sure if they would work in mssql but there are a couple of potential 
solutions for mysql outlined here:

Hi Ben,

Not sure about MSSQL but I believe the following is standard sql:

select id, max(version) from mytable group by id;

Message-ID: <C3CCE6A0.C5C1%cliff@pinestream.com>

The error handler on my production server has stopped working. I ran some
code to test it and am completely stuck. The trigger error line below works
just fine. But php isn?t directing it?s errors to the error handler.
blasasdfsdfgorg{; just stops dead. foobar(); which should also throw an
error since it doesn?t exist, also doesn?t get caught by the error handler.

Things were working until a few weeks ago and I can?t think of any major
changes since then. PHP hasn?t changed; no kernal updates, no code changes,
etc. Any ideas? 
<?php
echo 'Testing error handler';
                   
function error_handler($errNo, $errStr, $errFile, $errLine) {
    echo 'Inside error handling function';
...
...
...
}

ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);

$old_handler = set_error_handler('error_handler');

echo 'Making errors now';

trigger_error("An error", E_USER_NOTICE);
   
foobar();

Hi Cliff,

The two types of errors your having trouble with are the type that can't 
be handled easily with custom error handlers.

blasasdfsdfgorg(;
This makes a parse error.  PHP won't get far enough to use your custom 
handler because it will just die.  Manual 
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php> says:
The following error types cannot be handled with a user defined 
function: *E_ERROR*, *E_PARSE*, *E_CORE_ERROR*, *E_CORE_WARNING*, 
*E_COMPILE_ERROR*, *E_COMPILE_WARNING*, and most of *E_STRICT* raised in 
the file where *set_error_handler()* is called.

foobar(); (the function that doesn't exist):
I never tried this myself, but this comment 
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php#73239> 
suggests that normal custom error handlers won't be able to catch this.

You might be expecting an error message on screen, however, or at least 
something besides a white page.  If you're not getting it, it probably 
means that display_errors 
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php#ini.display-errors> is 
turned off.
> Things were working until a few weeks ago and I can?t think of any major

Is it possible you weren't testing for parse errors and "call to 
undefined function" errors back then?

I think I have just figured this out after wasting an afternoon. My errors
until now have mainly been smarty compile errors, which are caught.

Funny how all the examples on the php web site are like:

function userErrorHandler($errno, $errmsg, $filename, $linenum, $vars) {
    $errortype = array (E_ERROR => 'Error',

Even though these aren't caught!

So...the moral of the story is you need two error handlers...the customer,
user friendly, error handler, and the error_log file in your php.ini if you
want to keep php errors separate from Apache errors.

Hi there:

I have built a system that consists of one centralized user database,  
and a few other things, that have multiple sites around the outside  
connecting to it.  So, a login on one of the satellites happens  
through ajax connecting to a little proxy script on the satellite that  
uses curl to perform the actual login remotely.  each satellite  
resides on its own domain.

This is all fine, until other people on the project request that  
logins be preserved, regardless of which domain the login happened on.

I know that cookies have domain limitations, and so I'm trying to come  
up with a way in my head this can work, and work efficiently and  
effectively.  Anyone have any ideas?  Ever attempted something similar  
in the past?

My first idea is something like that evil facebook script that updates  
the feed on status with things people do at other web sites (fandango,  
etc.).  I suppose if some piece of javascript in the page is loaded  
remotely from the central domain, that it could look for a cookie from  
the central domain, and call a PHP script that sets a session variable  
on the satellite.  (The problem I have, of course, is that my login  
technically occurs solely on the satellite, even though it connects to  
a database remotely, so I will have to rearchitect that somehow;  
perhaps forcing the entire login process to run through a JavaScript  
loaded from the central server.)

Does that approach seem feasible?

Hi Marc,

If you really care about security this isn't really the kind of thing
that you should dream up on your own. What your describing is called
"Single Sign-On" or SSO for short.

Are your sites on the IntErnet or on an IntrAnet?

If your sites are on the IntErnet OpenID is one solution although I
don't know what sort of access control it offers such that you can
stop anyone with an OpenID account from accessing protected parts of
your sites. There's also something called Stanford WebAuth which is
Free so you can setup your own isolated auth server.

If you're on an IntrAnet there are a lot of products that do this sort
of thing. SiteMinder is one that's been around for a long time.

Although SiteMinder, Stanford WebAuth and products like it are not
*true* SSO since you have to enter your credentials twice - once to
login to your workstation and then again with the auth site. With true
SSO users never have to enter their credentials at all when they
access a site, they just go right on. True SSO is sometimes referred
to as Enterprise Single Sign-On.

If you want "Enterprise SSO" there's something called SPNEGO
authentication which is a special feature of IE and some other
browsers like Firefox. Microsoft calls this Integrated Windows
Authentication or IWA. IIS supports SPNEGO but PHP can't access much
info about the user once your authenticate and of course you have to
use a Windows web server.

Finally, my company (yes this is a proprietary pitch after all) offers
a full featured SPNEGO solution specifically for PHP on Linux and
FreeBSD. See sig for details.

So at the time of download, I want to specify the filesize. But filesize or

Can someone suggests any method to find out the size of an audio file such

Based on what php.net states, with PHP5.x and up you can use URLs with stat(). 
HTTP and HTTPS are in the list of supported protocols.

You could also store the file size when you add the MP3 to the system, but 
would need to back fill that information for the existing files.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Mod_rewrite and pretty urls problem
Message-ID: <C3CDEA7E.C64F%cliff@pinestream.com>

For pretty urls, I have set up mod_rewrite like so:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?$1

For a page like www.domain.com/faq the controller captures the faq command
and everything works fine.

But for www.domain.com/faq/ the images, css and javascript files are all
missing. They are all set up as relative links. I?m assuming that there are
now relative to the /faq directory, which does not exist. Is this a
side-effect of mod_rewrite? If so, how do you prevent it? Make all images,
css and JS files absolute links or always relative to root?

Also, what is the proper RewriteRule to preserve get query variables?

Something like RewriteRule ?(.*)$ index.php?$1

The session_start() function must be called before any output is sent  
to the browser. This usually done by putting the call immediately  
after the opening <?php tag.

What is on line 3 of registrationverified.php?

Alternatively, you could put a script on example.com that returns the
file size for a named file, so that
http://example.com/getfilesize?file=audio1.mp3 returns a size in bytes.

But the better option is surely to use stat(), if you have php5.

IMHO using ob_start() just masks the problem, it doesn't fix it. The  
real solution is to find out why the script is sending output before  
starting the session and start the session before doing the output.

You probably need to add a rule (or rules) before the one above (and also 
use L to shortcircuit the rest of the rules) when dealing with you faq 
folder and images/css.

Make images, javascript and css relative to root.  This is standard
practice.  Put the css/javascript in a folder with gzip turned on, and
the images in a folder without gzip.

Just use add [QSA] (Query string append) to the end.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?req=$1 [QSA]

Thanks John. Makes sense. Had it the other as a legacy leftover from when my
dev. app was in a subdir.

Excellent. This pretty url, mod_rewrite mystery is coming together...

I found that session_start() works only OK when it is the first thing that 
happens in a script. Before initializing variables and anything.
You script should start as such

<?php  // Line 1
   session_strt(); // Line 2

....everything else


I follow that strictly and since then never had a problem.

Hello all,

I have a class that handles session and that is included further down in 
the class.

Typically file struct:

PHP
    Config (dev, live, etc)
    Includes
    Instantiate classes (session_start( ) gets called in the session 
objects constructor)

    Support functions

    Main code, usually in the form of a switch( ) on a GET/POST var

    Debug data (db/script execution time, etc.)
</PHP

Works great for me.

The only rule is that you need to call session_start() before any output 
is sent to the browser.

You can accomplish this by either making sure that your script won't 
echo/print any data (and won't print notices, warnings, etc) before 
session_start() is called, or you can turn on output buffering (so make 
your first line ob_start(), or set it up via configs), so all output is 
buffered on the server until the script completes.

I use:

<?php  session_start();

and never have any problem unless I include a file that has that as 
the first line.

All,

I have been following the comments in this thread with surprise.  This 
is a fairly simple problem and should really be part of PHP-101.

The output is being started on line 23 of prehtml.php.  Odds are fairly 
good that this file is 23 lines long and the end of the file looks like 
this:

?>[\n]

That trailing newline after the closing PHP tag is causing output to 
start and resulting in the error message above.

In general, 2 simple rules for include file will save you these kind of 
headaches.

1. Begin the file with <?php, don't put any whitespace before it.  This 
is pretty obvious and the usual way of doing things.

2. End the file with a comment, like:

// end of file[\n]

I recall this concept being explained to me on this very list, the gist 
of it is that the php parser will stop when it hits the end of the file, 
so the explicit ?> tag is redundant.  Most editors however will add a 
newline [\n] at the end of the file which is then sent to the browser 
and breaks session and header functions.

The problem is not in any way related to whitespace within the PHP tags, 
as this is not sent to the browser, it is the whitespace outside the PHP 
tags (like a newline following the PHP end tag) that causes problems. 
By not explicitly closing the PHP tag the whitespace will all be treated 
as PHP code and ignored by the parser.

Follow these simple rules and you will not have to worry about this 
problem any more.

Dan

Actually, the error message says "output started at 
/home/getatwoq/public_html/chad/registrationverified.php:3"

So the output is on line 3 of registrationverified.php, not line 23 
of prehtml.php. If the OP had posted his code, we probably would have 
seen the session_start() on that line.

I guess after debugging a zillion lines of php code (by the way some
great responses here).  A tip?

BREAK IT DOWN!   Start with <?php  ?>  if you have too. Add your code
line by line. YOU WILL ALWAYS be able to fix the bug. In the end, it's
just a chip made of silicon -which is really just sand!

of a class of meteorites known as aerolites."

Message-ID: <1b3d2fde0802052329w5d96f03cv921377c331cf2761@mail.gmail.com>

I tried stat() function but it doesn't return the result. Anyway I got a
function to calculate the size of the remote file and it works fine. The
page link is below:

http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/1214

But now some other issue at the time of audio download. I use the following
headers in  the download page:


$mm_type="application/octet-stream";

header("Cache-Control: public, must-revalidate");
header("Pragma: hack");
header("Content-Type: " . $mm_type);
header("Content-Length: " .(string)(filesize($myFile)) );
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$filename.'"');
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n");

readfile($myFile);


But an error occured when I play the audio.

Can someone suggest another method for audio downloading ?

Message-ID: <000f01c86896$29814560$0200a8c0@X9183>

I don't know if anybody else has been having a problem when trying to FTP 
PHP scripts. I am using "1and1" to host my website and have uploaded  PHP 
scripts All have uploaded. Unfortunately some scripts are loaded correctly 
and other arrive as 0 length. No matter what solution is suggested by 1and1 
Tech. Support or tried, nothing appears to work I simply cannot overwrite 
these 0 length scripts. I have even deleted the sub diectory and reFTPed 
over new. The interesting thing is it is alway the same scripts that are 0 
length, I have rename the scripts and ftp them and still no joy. I have 
looked at the scripts but there is nothing to suggest anything that could 
stop an FTP, which is logical anyway, as what is contained within a script 
should not affect a script's upload.

"1and1" level2 support say, they cannot reproduce the problem and I am able 
to demonstrate it to their level1 support, thus the reason for level1 
support esculating the problem to level2 support. I have tried doing 
everything they have suggested and now have used FireFTP, Filzilla and Wise 
FTP5 to upload. I am now scrapping the bottom of the barrel, I would not 
have thought that this has anything to do with PHP; But just in case, has 
anybody else had this FTP problem and what was the solution?

You may have some binary character hiding at the beginning of your  
script. Delete the first line or two and try again. If that works,  
recreate what you deleted and try again. Alternatively, look at your  
script in some editor that will show every character rather than just  
the alphanumeric ones.

Personally, I've been ignoring this thread.  The error message PHP 
produces is completely clear about what and where the problem is.  But 
Dan, who's pretty good about stuff, posted, and I was curious about what 
drew him into the fray.  I've got to disagree with a few things he said.


> The output is being started on line 23 of prehtml.php.

Actually, the error message says "output started at... 
registrationverified.php:3."  The ":3" means line 3.  That aside,

Nope.  PHP is okay with one line break after the ?>, but not two.



> 2. End the file with a comment, like:

> // end of file[\n]

I agree it's much cleaner to not include the closing ?> at the end of the 
file.  But putting a comment about it being the end of the file is 
completely supurfluous.  The end of the file is the end of the file.

I was thinking the same thing.  I would suggest getting a better FTP 
client or at least using binary mode for the transfers.  Or, perhaps the 
files are 0 length on his computer. :/

Asking such broad questions is completely inappropriate.  You need to 
learn for yourself rather than asking people to do your job for you. 
There are tons of websites and books out there explaining authentication 
processes.

Good luck.

Hello Chad,

There are many ways to do this, and probably better ways then what I'm 
going to say..but here goes:

On each page, at the top, before you do any output do a login test:

<?php

function userIsLoggedIn($username)
{
    if ($username == $_SESSION['username']['loginBool'] == TRUE )
    { return TRUE; } else { return FALSE; }
}

if (!userIsLoggedIn($username))
{
    header("Location: index.php");
}
/* Otherwise we let them continue. */

That's really just some pseudo code.

Fair enough, the gist of the argument is that it is easy to end up with 
an additional trailing newline that isn't immediately obvious in most 
editors (I run with newline and tab marks turned on which would show 
this up) and can cause massive problems.

There are many reasons for adding a comment at the end of the file, but 
the single biggest one is to prevent the situation where some helpful 
developer looks at the file and says "Hey, they forgot a closing ?> tag 
here".  They then add the tag and maybe a couple trailing newlines for 
good measure. Hey presto, broken sessions and header redirects.

I am impressed you wrote that, but you should use curl instead.  Just
set it to follow redirects and only download the headers.  There is no
reason to write a partial implementation of HTTP using
streams/sockets.

I don't think you need Content-Disposition or
Content-Transfer-Encoding headers since you are only sending one file
per request.  I am not sure why you have a cache-control header
either.

Hi Chad,

Asking even the most vague question is at least a little better than 
giving up.  I think what you should do, though, is not just hunt around 
for a few tips.  Get in and learn the basics, especially on a complex 
topic like authentication.

Please google for /php authentication/ and /php authentication 
tutorial/.  You will find lots and lots of tutorials on the topic.  I 
can't recommend any one of them because this is an area that's been done 
so many different ways, and most of the tutorials and books I've seen 
screw it up in one way or another.

Follow along in one or two of those tutorials.  Those are the hints you 
need.

Folks on this list will be happy to help you with specific questions you 
might need to ask about along the way.  The help may come in the form of 
"google for x" sometimes, but generally that only happens when that's 
really the best answer.

Let us know how it goes as you progress.  New programmers need other 
voices quite often.  As long as you're putting in your own sweat and 
doing your homework, you'll learn a lot.

- Allen

I think this is going to be a lost cause.  It is technically possible
with PGP and you will need to have the public keys for each user,
which will require the users to  do things that they don't comprehend.
 I recommend doing what the banks do... "You have a secure message.
Please login to your account to check the message."

I'd implement the latter first, and then think about offering PGP as a
convenience method for power users later.

What if I just want it for sending log files to me? My intent was to just
email various log files to me using cron.

I wonder what the point is in allowing access to the home page when anything 
one does on there results into showing an unauthorized access page unless the 
suer logged in before. I think it is much easier to show only the login page, 
make the user log in, then have scripting for the home page to make sure that 
they did indeed sign in (I store the session ID in the user table in the 
database with a time stamp, there may be better ways). That script in the home 
page fires each time the page gets accessed and I send the user typically bcak 
to the login page via redirect when there is no entry for that user, which 
basically means that if they access the home page directly they will never see 
it unless they logged in using the login page. I think your requirement to 
have the home page visible to anyone and react on a hyperlink click to a 
different site complicates this quite a bit.

Something like the following should work:

cat log_file.txt |  gpg -e -r "pgp_username" | mail -s "Daily Log file
email" your at email.com > /dev/null

You just need to install a pgp extension for your email client and
import your public key into gpg.  For fun you can even toss in a
little bit of sed, sort and uniq to make the log file more manageable
if it is really large.

Try mixing up the order in which the files are sent.  If the disk is running
out of space during the transfer, you'll get inodes for each file, but no
data getting stored for the inodes to refer to -- hence, 0-byte files.  If
you change the order, and different files are zeroed out, then your server
is probably filling up halfway through.

If you change the order of transfer, and the same files are showing up with
zero bytes, then Michael Southwell is probably on the right track, with
weird stuff in the beginning of your file.

Is it considered bad practice to emit scripts within the body of a
page such as immediately preceeding the form that uses it? It seems to
work fine but from looking at some random sites I have yet to see an
example of this. Logically it makes sense to put the JavaScript close
to where it will be used no?

The standards nazis will tell you to put scripts in the head.  The
performance freaks will tell you to put your scripts as the last
element in the body.  Putting javascript in the middle of the page, is
bad practice but can simplify development.  So where you put scripts
is up to you... I prefer putting all scripts as the last element in
the body because performance is more important to me than standards
compliance, but I'm not afraid to put them in the middle or inline to
get things done faster.

Just don't do this:
<script>
var form_elem = document.getElementById('myform');
</script>
<form id="myform" ...>
...
</form>

The problem with the above code, is that the script searches for an id
that doesn't exist when the script is run.  It may work in some
browsers, but it will be terrible/buggy code.

I highly recommend using a js library with a good onLoad event
replacement (my favorite is jQuery).  The standard default onload
event sucks because it waits for all images to be downloaded rather
than being a "DOMContentReady" event.

John C.

So, what's to keep them from adding the ?> after the comment or replacing 
the comment with it? :)

This kind of situation is what coding standards are for.  If someone 
can't follow them, fire them.  :)

Hi John,

Actually I'm trying not to use much JavaScript if I can help it. I
just need a few functions to help with forms (so far).

How about src-ing a .js? I've been looking at random pages and I'm
surprised to see that not many pages actually do this. Is there a
reason?

For non-library code, it is faster to include the javascript with the
html because it saves a web request.  For library code, it is a
trade-off... an extra web request vs loading the js from the cache
during subsequent page views.

I also think creating a js file for each page is painful.  When you
change the html you generally have to change the javascript, so why
not keep it in one place?

I was not going to have a .js for each page. I think one .js will do.
And I don't see how this is any different from another cached .gif or
.css.

I would estimate that about 20 - 25% of the total video tutorials

I hope someone else might find some certain value and some helpful new

JavaScript(s) loads in an order similar to how CSS loads. Without
getting to deep, I have found incidences where a JavaScript snippet or
code section will perform as expected when the actual JS code is
embedded with script tags in the head of the HTML page, but when this
same script is loaded as a JS source file it will fail. Peter

Subject: [nycphp-talk] JavaScript just above form in body?
Message-ID: <272122.68844.qm@web50206.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Interesting discussion.  I use Dreamweaver as a code editor because of the intellisense and being able to visually see the page elements.  If you drag a div with a css class definition, the css updates automatically if it's in the document between the head tags, which I love.  I also would like to keep the css in a separate document for "neatness" sake, but then it doesn't update.

The intellisense gives php tags a bright red so I can see if an end is missing!

When you have a web document open in Dreamweaver, I kind of recall that
there was a menu interface where you can tell Dreamweaver to associate
an external CSS file with this document(s) and then those CSS rules will
show up in the dropdowns, menus, etc and then the external CSS will
update as expected. Take a look for this. 

 

Further to the JS, it has long been my impression that all these varying
JS insert positions and insert styles will potentially have an effect on
how and in what order your script(s) may execute:

a) JS script included as an external src file (inclusion order of
multiple src files is significant)

b) JS script(s) in head tag

c) JS (via inline script tag(s) or src ext) just after opening body tag

d) JS (via inline script tag(s) or src ext) within the body before a
target tag(s)

e) JS (via inline script tag(s) or src ext) within the body after a
target tag(s)

f) JS (via inline script tag(s) or src ext) just before the closing body
tag

g) JS (via inline script tag(s) or src ext) just after the closing body
tag

 

Additionally, CSS that the JS works with may need to be sensitively
inserted with the positioned JS. 

 

As I say, these are all my impressions only.

That actually makes perfect sense in terms of download speed.  It became
somewhat of a standard practice to include JS in the HEAD of the document,
but that actually slows things down.

I actually wrote about this and a bunch of other JS optimization tricks in
my well-ignored Wordpress blog (primarily ignored by me):

Insightful post, although I disagree with the bit about destructors.
I prefer to let the scope+garbage collection destroy objects rather
than doing it manually.

The key thing to understand is that the browser stops rendering the
page when it encounters a <script> tag.  The script is fully parsed
and executed, before rendering resumes.  Browsers must work this way
because the script may contain "document.write".   Presently, the
defer attribute is not supported across all browsers thus it is not a
viable workaround.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Saving data from forms
Message-ID: <000c01c869ea$3eb8c7a0$bc2a56e0$@com>

I was just writing something up and I have a question about saving data from
forms for a password.

 

So the logic for what I want to do is something like this:

 

Input from form -> check for magic quotes(if not then add quotes) -> md5
value -> save to database.

 

Now what happens if you change the logic to:

 

Input from form -> md5 value -> save to database.

 

Other individuals I have discussed this with would say that if you are on a
platform without magic quotes then the md5 values will be different.  Is
this the case?

That may very well be, but that comes only into play when you carry the 
database from one system with magicquotes to one without or vice versa, or end 
up having the magicquotes enabled after an update, but not before or the other 
way around. As long as you operate on a system that either has magicquotes or 
not it doesn't matter in the end. I use the same password obfuscation and used 
it on several systems without a problem, but maybe I was just lucky?

You will get a different hash, since "That\'s good stuff, man." is 
different than "That's good stuff, man."

In your case it doesn't fully matter if it's on or off, ASSUMING that 
they will ALWAYS be in that same state.  The initial save and the 
subsequent verification submissions will both hit MD5 function with the 
same string.  But if the company changes servers/versions/settings which 
winds up changing this ini setting, you're SCREWED.

PHP comes with this nightmarish feature turned off by default and most 
hosts I've seen have it off also.  So, if you need to ENSURE portability, 
plan your logic accordingly.  For example, if MQ is on, put in 
stripslashes before making the MD5 hash.  Or you could do the database 
server's MD5(), since the slashes will be gone by the time it gets there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SoapClient - Worthless?
Message-ID: <024301c86a9b$98bae740$ca30b5c0$@com>

Hi all,

I've been trying to use SoapClient against what I'd think would be a
heavily used and fairly standard WSDL:

https://apitest.authorize.net/soap/v1/service.asmx?wsdl 

Yet, SoapClient is extremely unstable and often causes Apache to
seg-fault.  I haven't SoapClient in over a year because of this (used
nuSOAP at that time) but I had figured SoapClient would stabilize.

Apparently, it hasn't.  Out of curisotiry, anyone else have these types
of problems with SoapClient - or have used SoapClient successfully?

We have been using SoapClient since 1 year or so without any proboem. But our 
scripts are using only 5 to 10 operations at a time. It has been seen that 
there are various reasons for this kind of SegFault viz.

# WSDL file
# LibXML version
# Some buggy versions of PHP like PHP 5.0 and PHP 5.1

We have been using PHP 5.1.6 but with latest updates. Below link may help you 
tracing your problem.

Hi,

What is the most appropriate quote_style value to use with htmlspecialchars?

For some reason I've always used ENT_QUOTES for everthing. But now I
have some code that automatically escapes element attributes and
ENT_QUOTES is creating a little bit if an issue with JavaScript.

Is there any way to get into trouble with htmlspecialchars?

Are there pitfalls to using ENT_COMPAT?

Message-ID: <a9caffe50802100520t9dc8110sba6de99274fc1811@mail.gmail.com>

I know that I could go to the Joomla forums and ask this, but I think
I'm going to get better results here, so bear with me. We just took
over a site for a client that was built in Joomla. Yesterday, the site
suddenly went down as though it was getting a DOS or spam attack. This
continued on to about midnight.

This morning, I noticed something very strange. The only page that
seems to be loading slowly is the home page. If I type the URL of
another page into the address bar, it will load with no problem at
all.

This is a Joomla 1.012e install. Is there anything that I should be
looking at in an attempt to resolve this issue?

As it ends up, though, I've ended up eating these words, thanks to our
friends over at MySQL.

Through much debugging, I finally discovered that any socket connection
to a https:// URL would cause the segfault - even something as simple as
file_get_contents().

Though not well described across the web, there is a symbol conflict in
versions around MySQL 5.0.27 and OpenSSL.  Thus the segfault.  Upgrading
to MySQL 5.051a and recompiling PHP against those client libs, and the
problem mysteriously fixed itself.

This isn't the first time odd symbol conflicts have happened with
libmysqlclient.  I can't pin it down now, but I do remember a very
similar issue not long ago.  Hopefully Sun can push some testing
practices, even if it is for PHP.

They're referring to the New England Patriot's loss to the New York
Giants in Super Bowl XXLII last Sunday. New England was 18-0 and a win
in the Super Bowl would have been a "perfect season". Almost 100
million people watched the game, second only to the 1983 M*A*S*H
finale.

Ah, thanks, I'm not interested in brutal "sports" executed by low IQed 
individuals. People actually watch stuff like that??? I thought the FCC 
prohibits brutality (football) and sex (cheerleaders) on daytime TV.

I guess now is the right time to duck?

Just pulling your legs.....I still think broadcasting football is a waste of 
energy.

Yes!  I've also had segfaults with mysql/php... upgrading and  
rebuilding everything fixed it.  I think it was something with a 64  
bit architecture, but that's off the top of my head.  When's that  
native mysql driver coming for php?  Looks like a dev version is  
available.  Anyone try it?
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/php-mysqlnd/

Also get segfaults with xml services now and then.  We've been using  
SoapClient with the National Weather Service WSDL.  It seems that  
everything has been running smoothly with that as far as I can tell.   
The code using it has been in production for a couple months.

Anyone ever get a segfault with debug_backtrace?  Had to disable the  
use of that on a couple of our servers.  Never could track down the  
cause of it.

I've played with it a bit, but it never struck me as being so cool to
warrant a move to it quite yet.

In general, segfaults could also happen because of mismatched libmysqlclient
versions and architectures (compiled for i386 or x86_64, for example).
Something that is always tricky (not only when compiling against
libmysqlclient) is getting PHP to link against the right libs (look at
--with-libdir=lib64 which is something I requested some time ago).

I've also reported this bug recently:

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44087

I'm currently using SoapClient, and although improved, it's still a little
shaky.

Ironically enough, NYPHP was recently approached by this group:

http://wso2.org/

and specifically:

http://wso2.org/projects/wsf/php

It's built on some solid XML/SOAP technology, and from messing with it a
little bit, looks very promising.  I'm actually discussing some issues with
their developers, surrounding complex WSDLs (which always seem to be a
problem).  They're releasing a new version this week, and from what they've
shown to me by using some test WSDLs, it's going to be solid.  And it
includes automatic class generation from the WSDL, which is the way SOAP is
supposed to be - finally in PHP!

I hear you - a real time killer, so generally I don't have the chance to
research... gone are those days...

Sorry, I meant `if you log the PHP errors using the log_errors
directive in php.ini'.

The logs picked up the error after the damage was done: "PHP Parse error:
syntax error, unexpected T_STRING". But the logs don't indicate why
addcslashes failed to slash a single quote in this one instance.

This doesn't make sense.  How would a slashing failure lead to a parse
error?  Parsing should always happen first.  Were you hacked?  Are you
sure it isn't an unsafe include?

	My knowledge of Java Script is limited to taking someone else's
script and making very minor changes. I would like to replicate PHP
ability to have an include file located somewhere that is not in the
normal web space.

	My clients have a document root of:

/home/domain-name/htdocs

	I have php.ini configured to first look in the current directory and
then /usr/local/include so that every client on the same server uses the
same source code. Is the scheme doable using Jave Script?

	Thanks

	A few week back I had asked for any suggestions for a WYSIWYG editor
and received many good suggestions. It was also suggested that I evaluate the
suggestions and report back.

	After looking at a lot of WYSIWYG editors I have settled on the Innova
Studio editor.

http://www.innovastudio.com

	I had four major requirements, not necessarily in order:

1. Highly configurable
2. The textarea name parameter could be an array name such as
name="FormValues[Comment]"
3. There could be multiple textarea elements in the same form.
4. Easy to install and configure.
5. Low, not necessarily free, cost.

	This editor integrates into PHP, ASP, and ASP.net environments.
A single developer license of $69.95 allows unlimited distribution in all
your commercial products. Many suppliers want a fee for every domain
on which their product was installed.

	Has anyone else used this product?

Are you eval()'ing code?  If so, _that's_ your problem, not the inability 
to add slashes. :)

A company I worked for until last July used Innova. It's not the *best* but
it's alright I suppose. I don't see why it's better than FCKeditor or
TinyMCE. I like WYMeditor for it's structure-over-presentation attitude, but
if giving your clients access to colors, fonts, etc., is important you can't
really use WYMeditor.

My biggest complaint with Innova is it's non-free.

Urb,

Short answer: no.

Javascript loaded from a remote file has to available via a URL accessible
to any browser; since the browser downloads and runs the script itself.

It's often good practice to concatenate any external script files used
across most of your site and use a javascript "minify" or "pack" technique
to reduce the size of the javascript file so it is downloaded to the client
faster.  Some of these techniques can also be used to help obfuscate your
javascript code, but in general, you should expect any javascript to be
visible to any user agent that can access it.

As a total aside, there's been some interesting analysis recently into
optimal methods for delivering javascript, e.g.:

http://ejohn.org/blog/library-loading-speed/

... anyone have a sense if there's any interest out there for a NYC
Javascript meetup/SIG?

I think jquery pretty much took over in the JS world (IMHO), just
google that with tool tips, you'll find lots of examples.

If I'm reading you correctly, you are trying to give each site access
to the same javascript source for easy maintenance and code re-use.
If that is the case, then the simple answer is to make the js script
tag for each domain all refer to a single domain for js code:  script
src='http://master.example.com/js/path/to/script.js'

Any domain can load js across domain boundaries.  That is why
cross-site scripting can be problematic.

No eval() in the code.

PEAR Config writes a PHP array file like so:

<?php

$config = array(
  param1 => 'value',
  param2 => 'val'ue2',
  ...
);

The writing process is what failed to generate the backslash. The parsing
happens on subsequent page loads. The strange thing is that I have not been
able to reproduce the error and I looked the the PEAR Config code, which
does use addcslashes($val, "\\'").

Yes, I can update config files on the fly in the admin interface. PEAR
Config loads settings from an ini file. The admin can change various
settings as required (like turn debug on/off, error text description, and a
bazillion other parameters), which are then written back to the ini file as
well as a php array file. For speed, the main system reads setting from the
php array, not the ini.

PEAR Config is awesome for this -- handles many container types (ini, php
array, php define, etc). But why addcslash failed to insert that backslash
is still the mystery.

We had a problem with Curl and PHP segfaulting with specific versions of 
MySQL.   Our troubles were on the 5.0.x  branch of MySQL and we ended up 
needing to regress from the latest for a while.  I think 5.0.36+ fixed 
the issues.  It was a real PITA to figure out and the only solution we 
found was to keep compiling versions of MySQL until we found the right one.

Latest release in the 1.0 series is 1.0.14, which has performance
tweaks, security fixes and some bug squashage. I'd consider running up
a parallel install of the site in another vhost, doing the upgrade and
seeing if that solves your issues - and even if not, you should test
to see if the upgrade was smooth, as you could probably use the added
security tweaks.

As for your front page issues, you need to take a look at what modules
are included on the front page only of the site. Chances are, you got
a module that is trying to fetch a remote resource (RSS feed maybe?)
and is simply timing out on you, blocking the page from finishing the
download (and render) to the browser.

And that's what it turned out to be. The site was using the zweather
module. As soon as I turned it off, everything started running
smoothly.

Yeah... weird.  I'm not terribly familiar with addcslashes or PEAR  
Config... but I do write a config file in a similar way to you...  
except I use smarty to write it and use the {$var|escape:'quotes'}  
modifier.  I'm looking at the code for that modifier and it uses this  
odd regular expression:

preg_replace("%(?<!\\\\)'%", "\\'", $string);

> Unfortunately, I can?t reproduce the error.
You tried a resave of your config with the same exact settings and it  
worked?  I dunno.  Is there anything else that could possible modify  
your config file?  Or anyway that PEAR Config can write something  
without passing it through addcslashes?

I would guess: was the single quote something different than the
standard single quote, like a very similar symbol but with an ASCII
code greater than 127 that wouldn't be caught in the character range
you specified for addcslashes() ?
Were some inputs coming from some documents edited with word
processors where you would have used this kind of characters?

First, Google works just fine for folks with JavaScript turned off.

Second, the search engine and advertising prowess has more to do with 
their success than their JavaScript mojo.

Well, then even more power to google for their overall innovation. 

But, my points when I am in a backwards compatibility discussion is not
about the literal code and compatibility issues, instead I am trying to
make the point that I feel that there is major benefit to be found in
innovating with code and not simply conforming the existent code to be
ever more compatible with the way things used to work in the past and
are every moment becoming ever more rapidly even more irrelevant. 

And I agree again, google's real success was not in their highhanded
technical code prowess, but it was in their "invention." They made
search a valuable modern tool in fresh ways. They massified the
potential of targeted advertising on the web better than how it had been
done before. 

So my central point(s) remains that programming innovation is more
important and should always be a larger ongoing vital concern than
backwards compatibility. 

Users, consumers, businesses and their clients are always willing to
innovate with you even at tremendous temporary inconvenience and cost.
Entire governments will change international legislation to match the
rise of innovation(s) (like HD TV, fiber optics, DVDs, GPS, electronic
payments, digital photography  << there's no backwards compatibility in
here. go ahead, go use a paper check at the grocery store to pay for
your shopping).

And it seems to me that all initially nonbackwards compatible
innovations are ultimately tailored for special access needs and then
those with special access needs gain improved access and improved
lifestyle too.

Let us evaluate this thought. Do those with special access needs want to
hear: a) hey, you are going to browse the web with up and down arrows
keys on a Netscape 1.0 compatible browser because all web experiences
have been stepped down to meet text and hyperlink only 1993-style tech
levels. Or would they rather be told: b) hey, you are going to browse
the web with a modern innovative browser hybrid product that can read
and speak aloud specially prepared web pages, can react to your spoken
word input and understands the gesticulations of a wireless air mouse.  

So coder, innovation first. Even in something as humble as JavaScript
technique.

Warmest regards,

First, Google works just fine for folks with JavaScript turned off.

Second, the search engine and advertising prowess has more to do with 
their success than their JavaScript mojo.

It depends on what the crux of your business is. If you need to create
the next great software package (be it web-based or desktop) then you
need to do product development. This is the realm where programming
innovation fits perfectly. Google is in the business of providing
people with access to (quality) content. This is why their online
tools (Docs, Maps, etc.) all fit into that overall plan. It's also why
AdWords is not strictly based on bid price. That speaks directly to
the prowess that Dan mentioned.

>  Let us evaluate this thought. Do those with special access needs want to hear:

Take that statement and look at it a different way.

Do users want to hear what technology they should have to use to browse the web?

Absolutely not.

As a webmaster, consultant, developer or designer the overriding
guideline of the web is that it is a user-centered medium, unlike any
of the other content-delivery mediums. The user has total control over
display, format and access.

So it becomes a case of market analysis and study of your audience,
which really isn't too difficult if you are using Google Analytics. Or
if you just pay attention to what is going on all around you. We are
increasingly becoming a point-and-click world, because people simply
don't want to waste time searching a website for information. That's
what they depend on Google and other SEs for.

Technical innovation is fantastic -- if it simplifies a process --
especially when it comes to the web.

Message-ID: <78c6bd860802131408n2b32726as83ccac9f4a99d2c8@mail.gmail.com>

This is just a curious question but consider the following trivial script:

#!/usr/bin/php -q
<?php
echo 'hello';
?>
end

Why does this ouput:

$ ./test.php
helloend

and not:

$ ./test.php
hello
end

Meaning the linebreak after the ?> is not emitted.

Is there some kind of special rule about this or is it just a quirk?

The character following ?> is always truncated.

If you want the line-break, put a single space after ?>.

This is a "feature" - there's some reason they did it like this, although I
can't locate it.  If you put a space after the ?> the line break will be
preserved.

Part of PHP syntax.  
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php> says:
"when PHP hits the ?> closing tags, it simply starts outputting whatever 
it finds (except for an immediately following newline - see instruction 
separation) until it hits another opening tag"

Not that I can tell you /why/ they do it this way.

This "feature" was implemented to avoid "output already started" error
messages caused by text editors that auto-append a newline at the end
of the file.

Message-ID: <C3D9E586.CBD4%cliff@pinestream.com>

NYPhP:

I have been holding off on this, waiting until things are ?perfect?, but
finally realized that could be an eternity. So...

Kerbeaz went live on Monday. I thought the hard part was behind me, but now
the true adventure begins ? building traffic.

Check out the site. Try creating a task as a performer or sponsor. Would
love to receive any and all feedback ? don?t be shy; don?t hold back! Based
on the few users that have tried it so far, I have a laundry list of things
to do, ranging from a new splash page, to more merchandise (of course), to
bug fixes, new features, etc. The kids are the easy ones ? walking my father
through it was pure torture:

Dad: ?I never received a confirmation email after registering?
Me:   ?Duh, you registered using Mom?s email?
Dad: ?How come Abby never responded?
Me:  ?You misspelled her email address?
Me:  ?Why did you make the reward 1 point? That?s one penny. What were you
thinking??
...
...

Targeting seniors ? what was I thinking?

Most importantly....

Thank you NYPhP. If you hadn?t noticed, I ask a question or two...now ?n
then....  There is no way I could have accomplished this without your
support. Everyone makes a big deal about open source. Well, the reality is
it?s not open source that matters, it?s the community support that is the
backbone of open source. The level of sharing and support is truly
inspirational. I?d love to repay whoever I can. Next time I?m in NY, the
beers are on me. And if any of you plan to visit Boston for Drupalcon, to
heckle us over the upset (we all know what that refers to now ? right. No
need to further rub it in), or for any other reason, please look me up.

Many thanks,
Cliff

No framework...was too deep into it to shift to one. Perhaps for rev 2.x

But when I knew zero about this stuff, I was fortunate to pick up Beginning
PHP & MySQL eCommerce, an Apress book, which advocated a 3 layer
architecture with a front-end controller. Although one strategy in the book
was way off base, at the 30K level it got me off on the right track.

No way! That's the whole point. I keep telling my kids, I'm tapped -- look

Good stuff Cliff.

You may want to checkout a couple of the "technical" meetups, especially this one:

http://newtech.meetup.com/

I know there's 4k+ on the NYC chapter of that group.

Thanks. That's a great idea. In Boston we have a Web Innovators Group
http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/ , which is run by a local VC firm. But I
previously hadn't heard of "technical" meetups -- great idea.

It's amazing how scaling up from 1 or 2 users to just a dozen or so has
already generated a page-long todo list.

You didn't mention the website address, but I guess most people who 
assume it to be kerbeaz.com.
What an interesting concept. I didn't quite get it a first, but after 
browsing around and reading the "About" section, it became clearer.
Now, if I could only figure a way of using the Kerbeaz site to curb my 
internet addiction :)

I'm wondering if we might have some meetings that go over some of these 
nifty javascript frameworks like dojo and extjs and jquery.

Yea I didn't get it at first either, I had to read the FAQ to  
understand it, maybe something should be on the front page to make  
people more aware so that they don't have to digg to find out what it  
is all about.


Hows it going Rolan?

When I was a kid around that age I was living on a military base in 
Japan.  No amusement parks.  My Coney Island was getting to ride in a 
tank or APC during maneuvers or to sit in the cockpit of an F4 at Atsugi 
NAS.  My brother and I were PITA kids so we didn't get to do that very 
often either <g>.

I like to thank everybody for the suggestions.

As suggested I checked for hidden binary characters everything checked out 
OK.

The solution to the problem is to use
BINARY together with FTP PORT 21 or 22 (if one port does not work, try the 
other)

Just a note, Paul.  I use Dreamweaver to upload all my files and have never had a problem at 1and1.  The upload is immediate, the upload feature also updates all my images, and I can switch to the browser to display my file/changes.  Just one more use for Dreamweaver.  :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] javascript calling php function
Message-ID: <478680.96171.qm@web50210.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I want to use javascript onclick to call a php function.  This code works, but puts a "done, with errors" in the status line in the file when loaded, which I do not want.  (I've done some error testing and isolation, and found the onclick is what is causing the "errors" message.)  Any ideas -- or other ways to do it?

onclick="<?php here_it_is(); ?>";

Also, I tried onclick=""; to make sure that it's the "embedded" php code that's the culprit, thinking that maybe javascript is reading the php code as nothing inside the quotes.

You can't call PHP functions using JS like this. You need to use Ajax 
mechanism to call PHP function from your JS code.

I dobut whether it is working, as you said above, the way you wanted or not 
unless output of PHP function is valid JS code.

Also check your source code of your page to see what it reads 
between 'onclick=""' once page is loaded in browser.

Thanks

Javascript is client side and PHP is server side.  Javascript's 
'onclick' can only call a function within Javascript's namespace, not a 
function living on the server.  You may find this easier done with a 
library like xAjax which wraps PHP functions for Javascript calls using XML.

Susan:

I need more information.

 From what you described above, you don't even need js to call a php 
script. You can do it like this:

<a href="here_it_is.php"> Click this </a>

If you want to pass a variable, then try this:

<a href="here_it_is.php?var=whatever"> Click this </a>

There's lot's of ways to communicate between php and javascript, like this --

http://webbytedd.com/b/timed-php/

-- but you need the secret handshake to do it.

So, tell us what you're trying to do and we'll provide guidance, if 
not downright confusion

Cheers,

tedd

I so wanted to avoid using Ajax only because my webpages are simple ones.  I've implemented Ajax on another website, and I'll just bring it over here.  Or, I'll might stay with the "you have an error" message in the status line, because the function is working -- the data from the called function does go into my database.  My users are mostly low tech, and they probably wouldn't notice the error, but I know how I react when I see "Done, with errors" at a major website!

Thanks for the responses.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] javascript calling php function -- now question on
	Ajax
Message-ID: <566797.97272.qm@web50210.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

My quick fix didn't work because it put entries into the database as the page loaded -- but they were there...

Anyway, Ajax is usually used to open an external file into a div, and it uses a form to send the request.  What I want to do is trigger a php script to run when someone clicks a certain anchor URL.  I guess you would call it my own stats attempt.  So I have no form, and nothing to be displayed on the current page because the user is going to URL from the click.

Please be gentle with me -- but what am I missing and is it at all possible, Ajax or not?

Susan

I so wanted to avoid using Ajax only because my webpages are simple ones.  I've implemented Ajax on another website, and I'll just bring it over here.  Or, I'll might stay with the "you have an error" message in the status line, because the function is working -- the data from the called function does go into my database.  My users are mostly low tech, and they probably wouldn't notice the error, but I know how I react when I see "Done, with errors" at a major website!
 
Thanks for the responses.

AJAX is just the technique to use for Javascript to invoke a PHP 
script. It has nothing to do with loading anything, that is up to 
your logic.  I use the Yahoo User Interface libraries when I want to 
do AJAX (just my preference). There are many places where I send a 
POST string to my script with information and I don't care what is returned.

Just set up an "OnClick" Javascript function which does the AJAX POST 
to your php script and then continues to where ever you want.

Sure.  Here's an excerpt of something similar using xAjax in a project 
I'm working on now:

/* HTML */
<a href="javascript:void(null)"
    onclick="this.blur();
            div_off('id_add_note_off');
            xajax_load_contact_notes_server('id_view_note',
             'id_view_note_on', {$notes[i].contact_note_id});
            return false;">
   <img src="/images/icons/edit.gif" border="0" alt="edit"></a>


/* PHP */
function load_contact_notes_server($container_id, $div_id, $contact_note_id)
{
     global $trms;

     $ajax_response = new xajaxResponse();

     // Load vendor

     list($results, $message) = admin_get_contact_notes($trms, 
$contact_note_id, true);

     // ....

     $ajax_response->assign($container_id, 'innerHTML', 
$trms->fetch('view_contact_note.tpl'));
     $ajax_response->call('div_on', $div_id);

     return $ajax_response;
}

thanks, Mike and Ken

first off, I'm not using a form (so no POST); the link is in an anchor tag.  I could put a form around it, but that seems to me making a simple link complex.

I want to run this php code when the link is clicked 

 $webpage="";
 $link_clicked="";

Function capture_click($webpage,$link_clicked)
{

     $entry_date=date("m-d-y-H-i");

      $sql = "INSERT INTO click_details " .
             "SET webpage='$webpage', link_clicked='$link_clicked', entry_date='$entry_date'";
      $ok = mysql_query($sql);

      if ($ok) {
        //error checking
      }
}
?>

and then the anchor text (or how I guessed would work)

<a href=www.nyphp.org onclick="<?php capture_click(name_of_my_webpage,link_name); ?>";>info on PHP</a>

Not to discourage you from using xAjax, which I've seen put to fine use, it
seems to me like you're adding Javascript where PHP would do the job just
fine, all by itself. Assuming that your anchor element is really going to
direct the user off the page, you might do well to implement something like
this:

<a href="redirect.php?website=http://www.nyphp.com&link=nyphp">NY PHP</a>

Then redirect.php would be the contents of your aforementioned code. You'd
also have to call your capture_click function yourself in the PHP code with
your two GET variables as arguments--and be sure to run them through
mysql_real_escape_string.

Plenty of sites use this method to track clicked links off-site, especially
when they monetize their clicks.

Have you considered a simple solution like Google Analytics? I'm no web
stats/SEO guru, but our sales and marketing people like it a lot... and it's
free.

Hope that helps a bit.
Austin

You don't understand. The POST method is defined in the AJAX code you 
write, it has nothing to do with having a form or not.

But, Austin, is correct, you don't need AJAX here.

That's true.  There are probably a dozen ways to handle this without 
Ajax.  One lightweight solution would be to have that onclick handler 
make a 1x1 image request (with query args) to a hidden DIV.

The conceptual bit that you may be missing is that you can POST data
to a php script without using a form.

The javascript XMLHttpRequest object can make GET or POST requests in
the background, without any kind of user intervention.

The onclick event sends a background request to your script, then
sends the user on their way to the linked url. As far as I know you
don't even have to wait around for the response.

Disadvantage is that you have to learn how AJAX works. But the
advantage over a simple redirect script is that Google and others will
see your links as normal links.

The most direct answer to my question ended up in my spam folder!  Because subsequent emails referred to Austin's reply, I went hunting for it, and there it was in spam.

I'm into keeping programming as simple as possible except where a more complex solution is warranted, and this is workable.

Thanks for all your replies!

Not to discourage you from using xAjax, which I've seen put to fine use, it seems to me like you're adding Javascript where PHP would do the job just fine, all by itself. Assuming that your anchor element is really going to direct the user off the page, you might do well to implement something like this:

<a href="redirect.php?website=http://www.nyphp.com&link=nyphp">NY PHP</a>

Then redirect.php would be the contents of your aforementioned code. You'd also have to call your capture_click function yourself in the PHP code with your two GET variables as arguments--and be sure to run them through mysql_real_escape_string.

Plenty of sites use this method to track clicked links off-site, especially when they monetize their clicks.

Have you considered a simple solution like Google Analytics? I'm no web stats/SEO guru, but our sales and marketing people like it a lot... and it's free.

Hope that helps a bit.

Message-ID: <C3E0AE8E.CDDA%cliff@pinestream.com>

I use the following to help work with SEO-friendly URLs:

RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [L,QSA]

This works fine on my development machine in the main .htaccess file.

On the production machine, I do the same thing, except it?s in the main conf
file and there is no RewriteBase, since that is per dir context.

But on the prod. machine, the css and images do not appear. All files are
relative to root (/css/file, /images/file). Any ideas?

In the .conf file are you putting the rules inside a <Directory>
directive?  As far as I know, <Direcory /path/to/folder/> works the
same as .htaccess, and you should try copying it exactly.

I didn't. I put it outside the dir directive. I tried moving it back to the
.htaccess file, and it works fine. This should be the same as putting it
inside the dir directive.

But I am still confused about why it is different when it's in the main
conf. I guess I just need to look at the logs to see what's happening.

Susan,

Just a warning that if possible your tracking script should limit its 
function to your known intended destinations else fail or whatever. 
Don't leave it "open" or you may find your site being utilized by others 
as a general purpose redirect proxy, often for less-than-honorable purposes.

Hi Radu,

You can give us a little more detail, right?  Tell us, what are you 
trying to accomplish -- that is, /why/ do you need the remote address, 
and what are you going to use it for?

HI,


Th right way to store IPs is by converting them to long using ip2long.
By doing it, you can check if it is valid (returns false on failure)
and also enable you a by region search.

There are services like geocode, ip2country, geoip, etc that gives you
a database of countries with their ip2long ranges.
All you have to do then is to get the column and search in this
country db. You are able to do joins (and use a single query) instead
of retrieve, convert, another query.

Also, I use this code to retrieve the IP address of visitor (please
notice that this may not work 100% of times, but it's better than a
single REMOTE_ADDR):


function _getIp()
{
	// This function get the IP of an user, even when he's behind a simple proxy
	// List of possible ip sources, in order of priority
	$ip_sources = array(
		"HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR",
		"HTTP_X_FORWARDED",
		"HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR",
		"HTTP_FORWARDED",
		"HTTP_X_COMING_FROM",
		"HTTP_COMING_FROM",
		"REMOTE_ADDR",
	);

	foreach ( $ip_sources as $ip_source ) {
		if ( isset( $_SERVER[$ip_source] ) ) {
			$proxy_ip = $_SERVER[$ip_source];
			break;
		}
	}

	// If the ip is still not found, try the getenv() function without
	// error reporting. This will automatically provide a FALSE result
	// on failure
	$proxy_ip = ( isset( $proxy_ip ) ) ? $proxy_ip : @getenv("REMOTE_ADDR");

	// Return the IP found
	return $proxy_ip;
}



I hope my $0.02 helped you a bit.

I was wondering about this, actually, but I also figured there must be
a bajillion other open redirect scripts out there.

Shouldn't it be okay to limit it to requests with a valid HTTP-REFERER
header? In other words, the redirect only works if the user clicked a
link on your site, not by following a link from some other site.

Just one point...

NEVER trust HTTP_REFERER.

You can change the HTTP_REFERER in a simple curl request.
I didn't read the thread entirely, but suggest a user to check for
referer is never a good thing.

Right, you can't trust the referer if you fear scripted attacks.

John, is that what you were talking about, or was it something more
abstract and seo-related?

I was picturing people using the open redirect to take advantage of
your page rank by causing your site to link to theirs.

And since you said never, there are plenty of cases where a referer
check can be used to stop abuse.

Consider misappropriation of images as an example: if an img tag on
someone else's popular site points to an image on yours, and they are
leaching your bandwidth, you can stop it by requiring a valid referer
for that image. This is because the vast majority of hits for that
image are coming from web browsers, not curl scripts.

Anytime you are trying to control browser behavior, as opposed to
scripted behaviours, you can "trust" the referer.

Hi Radu,

I didn't mean to question your motives -- sorry if it sounded that way.  
But you asked "what is the best to do?", and the answer is going to be 
"it depends on what your goals are." 

For example, you wrote:
> If I use 'getenv("REMOTE_ADDR") ' for return the IP
> address of the
> person visiting my site, what is the best to do? To
> save in a variable, like '$ip = getenv("REMOTE_ADDR");
Why store it in a variable?  This is probably not necessary unless you 
plan to access the value many times over the course of the script, in 
which case calling getenv() many times is a waste of processing power.
> , then insert it in a database(MySQL),
Why store it in the database?  If you want to access it again later, a 
database may be the best place to keep it, but you might also just as 
well keep it in a file somewhere.  Either way, if you don't store it 
somewhere on disk it will be gone later. 
> then take it
> with a sql query and write it in another place saw
> only by me?
I would expect the database is seen only by you.  If it's not, you may 
have trouble finding another place that is.  Either way, you probably 
don't need to write it to two places -- pick the best one and use that.
> <?php
> $ip = getenv("REMOTE_ADDR") ;
> ?> -where can I place this? From the begin of
> index.php?
That depends on the structure of your script.  I would recommend that 
you define that variable just before it's used, not necessarily at the 
top of your script.  Again, it totally depends on the logical flow of 
your scripts.

Feel free to add more detail -- I or someone else here may be able to 
give you more specific answers.

Best Luck,
Allen

Your paranoia is well justified. Open redirects are exploited by 
unsavory people in a number of ways. I came across a phishing email 
recently posing as a fake "Paypal confirmation". In the page was a link 
which appeared to point at aol.com (some 1/2 internet savvy people 
glance at the url to see if it points to a "reputable" site before 
clicking away on it). The aol.com link led to a well constructed 
imitation of the Paypal login page which was intended to maliciously 
steal accounts. Here is an example of the link:

http://www.aol.com/redir.adp?_e_t=ap&_a_v=2.0&_a_i=100124311x1116601028x1077500809&_url=http://www.nyphp.org

If you want to peek at a copy of the original phishing mail, check out 
http://www.datawhorehouse.com/0day/paypalphish

The safer thing for Susan to do would probably be to put all the valid 
redirect URL's in an array like:

redir.php:

<?php
$validURLS=array('
    0=>'www.mysite.com',
    1=>'www.yahoo.com',
    2=>'www.nyphp.org',
    3=>'www.php.net'
);

// some code to store hit in db logs goes here

header('Location: http://'.intval($_GET['r']));
?>

Hey folks,

I've finally removed myself from all mailing lists that I was on EXCEPT 
the NY*.* lists, so now I can stop sending my emails to /dev/null and 
actually be engaged again without getting 500+ messages a day :)

Anyway, I have a question that I'm hoping some people can assist me with. 
I need to design an account portal for my personal company.  Basically, 
I'd like to:

- Have basic login/logout functionality, change password, etc.
- Have a module system with access control (this user can access this 
module, etc.)
- Be able to import my existing HTML template into this system.

I could design my own, as it would be fairly straight forward to write 
something like this, but I'm wondering if others have pulled this off 
using open source software or another easy solution?  I don't want to go 
TOO complex if I don't have to.

Thanks!

-Matt

I'd advocate Drupal. It's not perfect, and I don't love doing serious
development with it, but for ease of use and choice of modules, it's pretty
hard to beat.

Matt,

You should take a look at our Lampshade framework. It's open-source and 
free for personal use.

http://www.thinkcomputer.com/software/lampshade/index.html

If you download the framework and the starter kit, I think you'll 
probably have your application up and running in under an hour with all 
of the features you described (authentication; security levels; HTML 
templates).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Currently working with Zend Framework, most every framework does what
you're talking about, but I like Zend because:

a. You can very easily use individual components without loading the
entire library
b. Your application is organized in a very simple manner
c. Zend Studio has Zend Framework built in
d. Very well documented at framework.zend.com
e. It's Zend, so you can rest assured it's not going anywhere for awhile

How hard is it to take something like this and adapt it to an existing 
HTML layout?  I don't mind RTFM, but I want to make sure if I invest the 
time it can do what I want.

Hoping to find something interesting and new in the Open Source community, I
downloaded Lampshade... and it's not open source by any definition I know.
Open source means you can change the source code and then distribute your
changes, the source code is freely available (not "up to the owner" whether
to distribute or not) and doesn't discriminate between uses of the software
(personal vs. corporate, government, and academic use for example).

I'm sure the software is just fine, but calling it open source (even if you
secretly mean something different by "open-source") is misleading and
potentially damaging to the vast communities that created the components of
LAMP in the first place. "Open Source" means more than just "can view and
edit the source." Lampshade is Shareware.

I would give +1 to Zend, which I've had great success with, but for a portal
site, you may have to do too much heavy lifting with Zend. I still advocate
Drupal, which will be easy to create a custom layout for, has a massive
community, and a very good book.

I sometimes wonder -- and I know we are drifting OT here -- what to do where
you need both Zend Framework and something like Drupal to co-exist on one
site. ZF for your custom database type stuff, Drupal for CMS. Sure, easy to
install both independently, but how to keep the look (view, template,
what-have-you) in sync on both without going nuts?

I think it'd be quite difficult to make them work well _together_ but if you
just wanted access to the same database, it wouldn't be so bad. The problem
is really on Drupal's end... they make everything quite modular, which is
nice, but the DB layer is not so modular. If you wanted to integrate Zend
Framework components into a custom Drupal module, that wouldn't be so bad
either. You can really code Drupal modules however you want as long as you
implement the right Drupal hooks.

Systems other than Drupal and Zend, I'm not so sure. I wouldn't want to try
to integrate Symfony with either, that's for sure.

Zend components can be used completely independent from the Zend
Framework, in your Drupal boot strapper:

require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';

function __autoload($class) {
  if (strpos($class,'Zend')!==FALSE) {
    Zend_Loader::loadClass($class);
  }
}

You can then go to town with Zend in Drupal, or any framework for that matter.

Message-ID: <415989.60015.qm@web50206.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

love your insight into this and the clear example you gave!  

I tried to get the header code to work, but it wouldn't execute the php code, so I went to my saved books on devx/Safari and got some code from the PHP Cookbook about using a form with hidden variables to send the user to the clicked link, and all works well now.  (and I'll add the acceptable urls code now)

example from PHP Cookbook, section 8.3.4:

<html>
  <body onload="document.getElementById('redirectForm').submit()">
    <form id='redirectForm' method='POST' action='/done.html'>
      <input type='hidden' name='status' value='complete'/>
      <input type='hidden' name='id' value='0u812'/>
      <input type='submit' value='Please Click Here To Continue'/>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

and just changed the action to where the user is to go and commented out the submit input line so the button wouldn't show and put my php code after the body tag.

Your paranoia is well justified. Open redirects are exploited by 
unsavory people in a number of ways. I came across a phishing email 
recently posing as a fake "Paypal confirmation". In the page was a link 
which appeared to point at aol.com (some 1/2 internet savvy people 
glance at the url to see if it points to a "reputable" site before 
clicking away on it). The aol.com link led to a well constructed 
imitation of the Paypal login page which was intended to maliciously 
steal accounts. Here is an example of the link:

http://www.aol.com/redir.adp?_e_t=ap&_a_v=2.0&_a_i=100124311x1116601028x1077500809&_url=http://www.nyphp.org

If you want to peek at a copy of the original phishing mail, check out 
http://www.datawhorehouse.com/0day/paypalphish

The safer thing for Susan to do would probably be to put all the valid 
redirect URL's in an array like:

redir.php:

<?php
$validURLS=array('
    0=>'www.mysite.com',
    1=>'www.yahoo.com',
    2=>'www.nyphp.org',
    3=>'www.php.net'
);

// some code to store hit in db logs goes here

header('Location: http://'.intval($_GET['r']));
?>

This is from a different thread and it caught my attention. I spend some 
considerable time in programming courses (not that it really helped, but that 
is a different story) and each and every time the instructors or authors drove 
home that one has to define and initialize variables and that this has to be 
done before doing anything else.

When I started with PHP I was reminded at my Commodore BASIC V2 programming. 
Need a variable? Go ahead and take one whenever needed. Until the scripts got 
a bit longer and the number of variables got a bit bigger that was OK. I 
forgot what exactly happened, but it probably was something abot 0, NULL, 
empty string, and FALSE not being the same. Anyhow, I got convinced the hard 
way that declaring (initializing? defining?) variables with smartly selected 
values (values that either make things work in a default manner or that cause 
the script to crash if not set correctly later) is a must.

The script doesn't care where that happens, but since I was always made 
believe that it had to be at the top (although I found that to be troublesome 
at times with session_start() not working right if it isn't the first thing 
done). My scripts usually (OK, I sometimes get lazy, but I try to stick to it) 
start off like that:

<?php
// ======================================
// This script gets called from
// - welcome.php
// - start.php
// and expects firts name and last name
// as strings via $_POST
// This script checks the input and if
// passed writes the strings to the db
// This script calls
// - connect2db
// This script returns / passes
// - success/failure string of db insert
// ======================================

// Start session
session_start();

// ======================================
// Define variables
// ======================================

// From $_POST
$firstname = "";			// Text string for first name, limited to 50 chars
$lastname = "";				// Text string for last name, limited to 50 chars

// For script
$errflag = true;			// Flag used for evalutation of input, true = error exists
$dblink = "";				// DB link
$insertquerysuccess = "Failed!";	// Return string
......


I guess you get the concept. It is a pain in the rear to keep up with it and 
maintain it, but even after months not looking at a script I know what the 
script does, what goes into it, what comes out of it, what calls it, and what 
gets called. So besides the blahblah at the top the first few dozen lines 
contain all the variable definitions. Allen suggests to "define that variable 
just before it's used, not necessarily at the top of your script". Allen or 
someone else, what is the benefit of doing it that way? What happens when you 
need to know which variables are used in a script? When you document the 
script and have to note which variables are input and which ones are output? 
Or if you know you used a variable, but do not know the name, how would you 
find it?
Allen also wrote "Again, it totally depends on the logical flow of your 
scripts". Why/when would the location of variable definitions depend on the 
logical flow of the script?

Am I missing something? Do I make my life more difficult than necessary? Is 
all the stuff the instructors said just BS? Why do I ask all these questions?

Any answers/discussions are greatly appreciated. Just to point out, I do not 
claim that my way is better. Which is why I ask if there is something better.

No disrespect meant, but instructors teach, not program, for a living.

My dentist used to say, "Floss only the teeth you want to keep."

I say, "Document the code you want to reuse." Simple enough concept.

Where and how you document is up to you -- whatever makes your work easier.

If you work for a team, then have a group-think and come up with a 
formula that best fits with everyone's habits.

As for defining/initialize variables before they are used, in some 
languages that's required and others it isn't. But in both cases, 
variables names mean more than where they appear, IMO.

But above everything else, program for yourself. Make your code a 
thing of beauty. Something that others (including teachers) can use 
as examples of what should be done.

Cheers,

tedd

This is a coding style that works for me, which I picked up from Steve 
McConell's book, /Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software 
Construction/.  I have no idea if that reference carries any weight with 
most folks, but I found some sense in the argument he presented for 
initializing variables as they are used, which is essentially that in 
maintaining the code it's helpful to be able to look up a few lines and 
confirm that the variable was initialized, edit the initialization, 
remove it, etc.  There's no "right way to do it," of course, but I do 
find this style to be very convenient and to lend itself to ease of 
maintenance. 

I'm not sure how often you actually need a list of all the variables 
used in a script.  For objects and functions you do need to know the 
properties, parameters, return values and such, sure.  Go ahead and 
document those clearly at the top, preferably using some standardized 
documentation method (phpDoc, doxygen, etc.).  But the temporary 
variables used within a function or method are usually only relevant in 
the lines where they're being used.  Document them where you use them, 
and save yourself the nightmare of keeping a single comprehensive 
doc-block up to date.

If he needs to use that value in the beginning of his script, he'll have 
to define it there.  Where it's used is determined by how he wants the 
script to work.  I still recommend defining/initializing/documenting it 
as close as possible to the place it's used.

That is indeed a pretty good argument and I will let it sink for a while, but 
I can't come up with any disadvantages to that.

Oh, ok, that is what you meant.

Another consideration is in what kind of environment(s) your code will
be running, and who will be working on it. I've seen MVC-centric
frameworks take the approach of putting a method at the top of every
model that basically sets the variables that might be used by that
model, and then call them from a getVariable() or some such method
later to ensure the context is consistent. As well, this has been used
as a (kludge-like, IMHO) solution for creating codebases that need to
support PHP4 and PHP5; and basically provides a model-based namespace
and avoids the "whups, no constructors in this PHP version" problem.

The only thing I like about the concept is that you know where all
your public variables are, and it forces you to think long enough
about your variables to have an edumucated opinion on how you
implement your model.

I have been validating textareas using ctype_print; however, I am starting
to get user errors. It?s amazing how many people cut and paste from MS Word.
So what appears to be simple text and a reasonably valid string actually
contains stuff that ctype_print does not like.

Does anyone use this function? Any better ideas for validating general text
areas? Just use the php filter function sanitizing control characters? Other
ideas for validation and dealing with cut ?n paste user input?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Frameworks... CodeIgnite and Symfony
Message-ID: <765156.34330.qm@web90603.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am looking into using a framework for new projects.
Most of my projects are larger CMS / User Authentication type sites that allow a main site admin and sub admins edit/add content to a site. There are also private member sections that the site admin can add and remove users from. 

Currently, I have use Pear MDB2 and Log for good portions of the sites. 
Most of the sites seem to be following the same overall structure, but still need the flexibility to have custom functions and such.

So this being said, I am thinking that switching to a framework would be a good next step to be able to use. I like the idea of people working on the same functionality and using tested code to create more stable and reliable applications.

I am looking at CodeIgnite and Symfony.
If anyone has used both and has any feedback, that would be great.
I also want to know if sites using either of these will be able to handle heavy load and traffic?

Thanks.
Bill

Message-ID: <26423148.1612561204089563129.JavaMail.root@vms064.mailsrvcs.net>

I am new to PHP, but I did two CMS systems in ColdFusion, so I can give you the approach I used.

Enter each "funny" character into the form and save the field (textareas in mine).
Then see what binary character(s) come back.
Then code to replace them with more conventional characters, or the html &---; codes in your app.

Attached is the zipped CF routine which might help tho you can't use it directly.
BTW, "&" in CF is for concatenation (. in php).

This problem drove also crazy for a while as the users were pasting not from Word, but from Pagemaker or something.  To add to it, I got different returned char(s) on the production server than on my box at home, which is why there are TWO sets of CF Replace()s.

Good luck!


>Charsets are still driving me nutsI have been validating textareas using ctype_print; however, I am starting to get user errors. It?s amazing how many people cut and paste from MS Word. So what appears to be simple text and a reasonably valid string actually contains stuff that ctype_print does not like.

With personal experiencem  I can CodeIgniter is a light weight and fast.
Scaling really comes to writing good code and knowing your enemy,
bottlenecks.
Bloated and inefficiently written sql queries seem to be the number one
problem of site performance.

Are you using utf-8 encoding?  What do you need to validate/sanitize  
with the textareas?  That the input is using the correct character  
set?  Need to strip html from it?  I've had pretty good luck with  
using utf-8 and having text cut and pasted from MS Word come through  
fine.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] HTML to PDF converter
Message-ID: <195230.98426.qm@web53310.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Does anyone know of an "industrial strength" HTML to PDF converter that can be launched from PHP script? I've tried some open source libraries like 

html2php ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/html2fpdf ), 
dompdf ( http://www.digitaljunkies.ca/dompdf/ ), 
HTML_ToPDF ( http://www.rustyparts.com/pdf.php ) 

but the problem is that they either crash or don't generate a faithful reproduction of the original html. Need something that does a professional job and runs on Linux.

Thanks

Leo K.

I've used Open Office with unoconv --
http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/

Our PHP scripts which needed access to the routine just backticked the
command, like `python unoconv document.html -o pdf` though that command may
be a bit off. Very, very nice output, and it would accept nearly any
document format, so we used it (primarily, actually) to convert document
formats to HTML for full text searching.

I have been waffling between 8859-1 and utf-8. Regarding validating a text
area ? good question. No stripping necessary. I though ctype_print looked
good ? any reasonable printable character. Maybe textarea doesn?t need to be
validated/sanitized if everything is escaping properly? I thought the
browser took care of the charset, but don?t know for sure.

A week or so ago I read on the MadCap forums that someone recommended using 
Prince. It supposedly takes the HTML and CSS and makes a PDF out of it. I 
haven't had time so far to take a look at it.

Randal... try this one...

function getClientIp()
{
	// This function get the IP of an user, even when he's behind a simple proxy
	// List of possible ip sources, in order of priority
	$ip_sources = array(
	"HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR",
	"HTTP_X_FORWARDED",
	"HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR",
	"HTTP_FORWARDED",
	"HTTP_X_COMING_FROM",
	"HTTP_COMING_FROM",
	"REMOTE_ADDR",
	);

	foreach ($ip_sources as $ip_source) {
		if (isset($_SERVER[$ip_source])) {
			$proxy_ip = $_SERVER[$ip_source];
			break;
		}
	}

	// If the ip is still not found, try the getenv() function without
	// error reporting. This will automatically provide a FALSE result
	// on failure
	$proxy_ip = (isset($proxy_ip)) ? $proxy_ip : @getenv("REMOTE_ADDR");

	// Return the IP found
	return $proxy_ip;
}


This can help you to retrieve the right requester ip.
Later give me some feedback if it worked, please.

Since this is a religious debate, I propose that we slaughter anyone who
disagrees.

Hopefully the Zend Framework will be the last man standing.

What kind of hit? Does the url have "attack" strings? Check out phpids --
might help.

Here's to hoping that, whatever your chosen framework is, it remains
to be supported for a long, long time to come by legions of great
open-source programmers.

(What scares me the most about any framework is the likelyhood of
eventual abandonment.)

it is targeted entirely to the one page on the site. if i take it
down, everything works fine.

problem is, that's *the* most important page on the site.

To me this doesn't really sound like an attack.  Unless you're getting 
thousands of hits from the same IP it's more likely that your site has 
just reached the point where its resource requirements exceed the 
capacity allocated to it.

It sounds to me like you have an efficiency issue, most likely your 
database connections are not being properly torn down after each page 
view leading to multiple connections hanging around and gumming up your 
mysql connection pool.

Are you using persistent connections? Are you on a shared (vhost) box?

If you answered yes to both questions, you have found your problem. 
You'll end up with a persistent connection for every webserver thread, 
most of which will actually be servicing requests for other sites *but 
still using up one of your connections*.

If you are using non-persistent connections you might want to try 
registering a shutdown function to explicitly tear down the db 
connection, or switching to persistent connections (if you are on a 
dedicated host).

You're received an spider attack.

The first thing to do is to disable the access to this page. Create a
robots.txt in your main website and disallow it.
You can take an example by accessing www.google.com/robots.txt

The second stage is to prevent bad spiders from read the robots as its
destination router.


One thing that can help you is a quick read of my portuguese talk I
gave at PHP Conference Brazil 2007 to know a bit more about it. Google
can easily translate it to you. Here is the URL:
http://www.prophp.com.br/downloads/phpconf2007/spiders_crawlers_no_php.zip


Also, you can change your entry.php to _entry.php, and ask a JS
confirmation at the beginning of the page... if user click yes,
redirect... not, move to 404. This will lead the spider bot into a
crazy situation and will go down in this request. By subsequenting
going down, the spider can stop. Try this one...

Also, you can check for the USER_AGENT the attacker is using. if it's
not any known, redirect to 404.
But this is perfectly overwritable via curl... so don't trust too much this one.

You know, all modern browsers - for the last ten years - use http/1.1 rather 
than 1.0.  So you can probably just discard all http/1.0 requests as being 
clearly the work of machines rather than humans.

Your monitoring software will stop working if you do.

Also, if you're running a niche site which it appears you are, feel free to 
ban areas of the world that annoy you.  I see you have requests coming in 
from Mumbai, Japan, Spain, etc.  It seems unlikely that these are people 
actually interested in the history of Ohio.  So feel free, at the server or 
Apache level, to just deny requests from large swathes of the IP address 
space.  You won't lose many (or any) legitimate viewers.

You should solve this problem at the server or Apache level (or higher), not 
at the PHP level.  I don't know how much control you have over the server, 
but if it's your machine, you can use, e.g., hosts.deny to block IP address 
ranges that annoy you.

Easy to figure out.... 

"show global variables like '%max%'; 

What is the value of that which is returned?

Also, run the same, except replace variables with status.  What is returned?

ok. but how will that affect google or other SEs trying to crawl the site?

yeah, i'm considering that.

Yeah, that is why I am choosing between these two. Looking for number of people and activity involved in the projects.

I am leaning towards Symfony for the admin generation.

Havent tried any yet though.

Hi Randal,

I've never personally had an issue like this but I have a few ideas for you.

First, looking at the IPs isn't going to do you any good if they truly
are random. It just means their spoofed.

To the very end of the script being hit, try add the following for a
few minutes:

sleep(5);

If you're lucky, the HTTP client isn't smart enough not to wait for
the response. Look at the logs and see if the requests are still
coming in as frequently. If they are not it is one or maybe a few
clients and definitely an attack of some kind. If it does not slow
things down, either the HTTP client isn't waiting for the response or
it's a distributed attack or it's not actually an attack at all and
you're just popular today.

You might also try:

flush();
sleep(1);

This shouldn't bother regular users but if it's a single client this
might help (or might not).

Then, with some breathing room in place you need to look at:

* The GET request string
* QUERY_STRING parameters
* The USER_AGENT string
* headers

Get a packet capture like:

# tcpdump -s 0 -w out.pcap port 80

and look at the whole request in WireShark. Try to identify the
pattern. Then compose a small function called 'is_annoying' that tests
for that pattern and replace your stop gap code with it:

if (is_annoying()) {
    sleep(10);
    die();
}

Mike

so what you are saying is to use mod_throttle to limit the amount of
bandwidth that is available to each user?

this is on a dedicated server, and from what i can tell, mod_throttle
can limit bandwidth based on the virtual host or the user, whichever
you prefer.

Only allow X requests per second from a specific IP or a specific /28, 
etc.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP/MySQL environment problem??
Message-ID: <001801c87a3d$b54f3580$0200a8c0@X9183>

PHP problem environmental controlsThe application is a classic traditional computer applications of add, update and read selected record.  The add record routine lines up the next record to be added by checking what the last record added number was.
The application was developed on  "localhost", Windows environment, and all working as expected, adding, updating and reading records up to a preset maximum of 100.

Then thethe whole application was transfered into its' "production environment" on my web space, Linux environment for testing. Everything works fine for the first record only. I cannot add  records thereafter. I have "desk checked" the coding and with the exception of the MySQL database parameters (host, user, password and database). All coding remains the same.

I cannot understand what is wrong is it because of the different operating environments or could it be something else? Has anybody got any ideas

Does the database user have SELECT permission on the table in question?

Are the database schemas the same?

Might not be your exact problem, but I once had some issues porting of 
the the data from one machine to another. The auto increment was failing 
with a "duplicate index" error, but I could not find any duplicate 
indices. There was, however, a 0 value in the indexed column, which upon 
removal, fixed the issue. I think the table was initially populated and 
then maybe later converted to an auto-increment type without throwing an 
error. But, when I did an export and import into another machine, it 
kept failing.

 Semantic Forms

Description:

The Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) allows users to add structured data to
MediaWiki pages through simple wikitext markup that identifies
relations between pages and attribute values of pages. With this
information, SMW can help to search, organize, browse, evaluate, and
share the wiki's content.

Semantic MediaWiki
http://semantic-mediawiki.org/

Semantic Forms are an extension, based around Semantic MediaWiki, that
allows users to create forms for adding and editing pages that use
templates to store semantic data. Forms are defined using editable
text files, written in a custom markup language, that are then parsed
on-the-fly when a form is needed.

Semantic Forms
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Forms

MediaWiki is a free software wiki package originally written for
Wikipedia. It is now used by several other projects of the non-profit
Wikimedia Foundation and by many other wikis.

First thing would be to check that your version of phpMyAdmin is 

compatible with MySQL 6. -Peter
