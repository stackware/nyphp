One day, a Pretty Sharp Guy decided to ask God about some stories he'd 
heard.

[PSG] umm... Hi God, what's happenin'?
[G] The Usual...
[PSG] Mind if I ask you a coupla questions?
[G] Shoot, you've got the floor.
[PSG] Is it true you can make stuff?
[G] What kind of stuff do you mean?
[PSG] You know, &quot;stuff&quot;.  o O (if he's God, he should know what I mean)
[G] I know what you mean, but I like when people ask me specifics.
[PSG] o O (how did he know what I was thinking?)
[G] waits...
[PSG] Well, I heard you can make things. Ants, bugs n' stuff like that.
[G] This is True.
[PSG] And bigger n' more complicated things like dogs and platypusses.
[G] Well, I just slapped the platypus together real quick.
[PSG] I even hear that you make donkeys.
[G] Yep.
[PSG] Donkeys are pretty stupid.  I could probably make one myself.
[G] You think?
[PSG] Sure, it's just a matter of puttin' the ingredients together.  It 
can't be THAT hard to do.
[G] You're right.  It's easy.
[PSG] I think I'll just show you how it's done.  (goes to get some dirt)
[G] WAIT!!
[PSG] What?
[G] Get your own dirt.
