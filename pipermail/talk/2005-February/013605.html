<PRE>This is getting worse as I go.  Interchange doesn't work on CPanel, which the host uses. Agora cart looks real clunky and I need something that the customer can easily use to add to the cart. CubeCart is moving servers, is commercial, and I can't tell how it looks.

*sigh*  At least this *is* a market--most business owners I know wouldn't want to work through this hassle.  ;)

ciao!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm looking at doing some side work setting up CMS and shopping carts for small businesses. The web-host I use has a few offerings that are php based and I'm looking at the requirements and set up to see which one I'd want to support.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OScommerce requires register globals to be on, and Zen Cart requires some world-writeable directories in the DocumentRoot. THe other possibilites are AgoraCart, Interchange Cart, and CubeCart. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We started a project with OSCommerce and found it to be a hairball of
</I>&gt;<i> code/presentation and security issues.  It was really a pain to extend
</I>&gt;<i> without bastardizing core code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We ended up scrapping it and using IC (interchange).  The documentation
</I>&gt;<i> is bad (they really need a wiki-doc-project), and we re-wrote most of
</I>&gt;<i> the templates (they were filled with &quot;legacy&quot; HTML coding -- i.e tables
</I>&gt;<i> within tables, inline styling, etc,).  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But after you get going on IC, it is a quite stable, secure and very
</I>&gt;<i> extensible platform.  My favorite part is IC uses a daemon process to
</I>&gt;<i> handle all the heavy lifting, while completely detaching critical
</I>&gt;<i> procedures from the client.  The &quot;catalog&quot; (or store-related files) are
</I>&gt;<i> completely separate from core and you can also override any core
</I>&gt;<i> functions with your own without breaking core stuff.  This all points to
</I>&gt;<i> a solid framework.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm reading Chris' security workbook and trying to critically review anything that deals with money. My biggest fear is that one of my customers has a compromise and the public image of the business goes so bad that they lose their business. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, I'm generally a &quot;worst case scenario&quot; sort of guy...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do you protect yourself against liability, and more importantly how do you give the customer the security they deserve?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can protect yourself and clients with a software license.  You are
</I>&gt;<i> protected by the IP portion and your clients by the warranty section. 
</I>&gt;<i> Here you can mitigate your clients risk by taking some or all of it on,
</I>&gt;<i> even offer your clients full indemnification, all for a charge.  Or, as
</I>&gt;<i> the other extreme, us &quot;AS IS&quot; verbiage.  You can also sell warranties
</I>&gt;<i> for many OSS (but refer to the specific license for the project).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OSRM group also offers insurance for open source stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.osriskmanagement.com/">http://www.osriskmanagement.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Redhat and HP offer indemnification protection for their Linux-based
</I>&gt;<i> products.
