<PRE>Hey Faber!

On Fri, 11 Feb 2005 14:46:58 -0500, Faber Fedor &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">faber at linuxnj.com</A>&gt; wrote:

There are several projects available:

  * DocMan document manager (use software as documents)
    <A HREF="http://www.mambodocman.com/">http://www.mambodocman.com/</A>
  * Remository (file/software repository)
    <A HREF="http://mamboforge.net/projects/remository/">http://mamboforge.net/projects/remository/</A>

Those should get you started, or at least provide some inspiration ;-)

&gt;<i> Out of the box Mambo/phpshop looks to be overkill as well, so something

</I>
That is my thought as well, you will spend a tremendous amount of time
trying to turn phpShop into something it was not intended for.

&gt;<i> Also, the CSS don't work very well under Linux/Firefox; MS/Firedox and
</I>&gt;<i> MS/IE look okay.  I assume I'll need to redo the CSSes?
</I>
That is just the template, and I assume you mean SolarFlare, the
default that ships with 4.5.1 series. It is a very beautiful template,
but also a very, VERY temperamental one. Check out the following site
for a demo of hundreds of templates:

  <A HREF="http://demo.mambohut.com">http://demo.mambohut.com</A>

Find anything you like? Probably will find the template for download at:

  <A HREF="http://www.mamboportal.com/">http://www.mamboportal.com/</A>

Didn't like a single one? Then take the tutorial and do it yourself,
you will be amazed at how easily you can create a tempate for Mambo
(there is even a DreamWeaver extension for the html-source-impaired):

  <A HREF="http://www.mambosolutions.com/dw_tutorial/">http://www.mambosolutions.com/dw_tutorial/</A>

That might give you a better experience trying Mambo. BTW, we are
getting ready to announce a new family of sites to bring all this
information together, hoping to speed up both adoption and the
learning curve (yes, I will personally make sure API documentation is
very visible!).
