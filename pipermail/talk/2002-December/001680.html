<PRE>I agree that it have showed lacked of thought, but PHP is still in 
development.  Advancement in any language all have this growing pain.  Be 
patient, a standard will come once the dust comes down.

I completely agree with you, Gerald.

     There is no direct, easy way of making everything compatible with
everything else. It's not your fault, obviously -- it's just a lack of
thought on the other programmer's side.

     Changing the php.ini file around on the fly for specific applications
isn't really a feasible idea, and I realize that. It's an age old problem,
and it just boils down to programmers writing crappy, incompatible code.

-Bradley.

 &gt; &gt; Your issues can be easily addressed by editing the php.ini file.
 &gt;
 &gt; it's not so easy.  i run many different programs.  they have
 &gt; different requirements in php.ini.  mostly i can deal since they
 &gt; rarely conflict.  but i'd like to run the sites as securely as
 &gt; possible.  that means disallowing per-directory php.inis,
 &gt; register_globals=off and safe_mode.  and then stuff breaks.
 &gt; clients want to run their own different programs.  and they
 &gt; won't pay for their own box.  so we have to all have them
 &gt; run on a common box.  what a mess.
 &gt;
 &gt; even on my notebook, where i have total control, i can't
 &gt; change php.ini settings willy nilly because while i can get the
 &gt; current application to run, other applications will stop running
 &gt; or would become insecure (not a problem on my notebook,
 &gt; but a porting problem later if the code i write depends on those
 &gt; settings and my web server is set up to be more secure than my
 &gt; notebook).
 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; ; You should do your best to write your scripts so that they do not
require
 &gt; &gt; ; register_globals to be on;
 &gt;
 &gt; i wasn't posting about my scripts.  i already write my scripts for
safe_mode
 &gt; and the PHP 4.2.x default settings (with some stricter settings too, 
like,
 &gt; uh, safe_mode).  i was asking about other scripts, lots of which can
 &gt; be downloaded, and none of which (of the not so many, but n&gt;5 i've tested
 &gt; so far) will run unmodified with the settings mentioned above.
 &gt;
 &gt; is there even an understanding in the PHP world that there might be a
 &gt; problem with the current situation and that a solution is needed?  either
 &gt; that or perl will win.  as i noted, i've got bugzilla (royal pain that it
is
 &gt; to install notwithstanding) running.  and i have not got a single PHP
 &gt; bugtracking system running correctly yet (mainly because of the
 &gt; register_globals requirement, they were written for 3.x, 4.0.x etc).
 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; ##### JMD: This is set to On in Mandrake because a lot of existing
 &gt; &gt; scripts ; needs it to be on, and we don't want to break configuration.
 &gt; &gt; Turning ; it on is a Bad Thing (tm), but for the sake of compatibility
and
 &gt; &gt; less ; technical support, we'll close our eyes ;-)
 &gt; &gt; register_globals = On
 &gt;
 &gt; thanks for the info :).  i compile my own PHP on Mandrake, because
 &gt; i need DBG to work, and i don't know how to get DBG to work with
 &gt; Mandrake's PHP.  easier to just install my own PHP and apache
 &gt; in /usr/local.
 &gt;
 &gt; the info is useful though, for reference, and so i know to turn it off
 &gt; on production sites.  thanks again.
 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; Just curious, what don't you like about Perl?  I started in Perl and
find
 &gt; &gt; the two so similar that it was an easy transition.  Perl is a little
more
 &gt; &gt; stringent in its requirements but that is not a bad thing IMHO.
 &gt;
 &gt; there *is* a similarity, i agree. PHP was just easier for me since it
 &gt; looks so much more like C.  i can't stand the line noise that some
 &gt; perl looks like.  but that's just me.  i'm sure if i worked on perl 
enough
 &gt; i'd learn it pretty quickly and use it.  even the line noise i'd get used
 &gt; to eventually :).
