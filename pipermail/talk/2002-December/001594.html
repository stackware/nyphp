<PRE>Well I think you said what I was trying to say a bit better.
I'm not really hard on people for using a &quot; on a static string
rather than a ', but I would like to know they actually know
the difference in how they are parsed. I just feel like more senior
developers do write better code, not only does it work, but it takes
into account a great deal of future expansion, it is usually well 
documented and there is usually a lot of good forethought put into it.

A long while ago at a job I was forced into a bunch of standards by the 
lead developer, which at the time I hated. I didn't see any use for them 
until I got a new job, and was forced to fix an amazing amount of really 
unorganized hacks. At this point I fully understood the need for fully 
commented, peer evaluated code that fit a style guide. Also at this job
the lead developer ignored a good amount of my questions, causing me to 
seek out the answer on my own, via documentation or trial and error.

I think it helped me greatly. I wish some of the people I worked with 
had the initiative to teach themselves some things without needing to 
have someone walk them through the most basic parse errors.

I don't think that document has many uses from a professional 
standpoint, but I did understand his frustration and I did find the 
humor in it, regardless of if I agree with all of his points. =)

</I>&gt;<i> trade-off for other things. The problem isn't that people write
</I>&gt;<i> inefficient code, it's that they don't know the difference. Much of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;web scripting&quot; is written in a RAD environment and should be written
</I>&gt;<i> in such a way that it's fast to code, fast to replace when the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality changes, and easy to read. This is not to say that
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency should be ignored, but making every last component perform
</I>&gt;<i> at its optimum is probably a waste of valuable developer time that
</I>&gt;<i> could be better spent on other things (such as writing better comments
</I>&gt;<i> and documentation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) People don't know what they're doing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a difference between a junior developer and a senior
</I>&gt;<i> architect. Similarly, there's a difference between somone who picked
</I>&gt;<i> up the PHP-in-24 hours book last week and someone who's deployed
</I>&gt;<i> dozens of successful projects. If you're hiring, and you don't know
</I>&gt;<i> the difference, your project isn't going to succeed if you're doing
</I>&gt;<i> anything remotely complicated. Junior developers have a valuable place
</I>&gt;<i> on a development team, but when they're in charge of the development
</I>&gt;<i> effort (or solo), it's only natural that their lack of experience is
</I>&gt;<i> going to show up in the final product.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I read a good rant which made a lot of sense to me at

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
