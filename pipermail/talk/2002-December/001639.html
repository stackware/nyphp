Subject: [nycphp-talk] Server switch

Hi,

I'm trying to move a group of sites from an internal overburdened server to
a new colocated server.

I'm having a few problems with some PHP commands that don't want to work on
the new environment.

1. The mail() command no longer works. Although I can send mail using
popen() to communicate directly with sendmail.
Your sendmail.mc might be pointing to a specific address (?) - usually on
this line: DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp,Addr=x.x.x.x, Name=MTA')
If that is the case, correct it accordingly.  It'll solve #2 problem as
well.


2. My fsockopen() behaves differently. For certain reasons, I need to
connect to a mail server and an ftp server via a socket. These
communications no longer work. It appears to have something to do with the
line endings.

3. When connecting via FTP (not through PHP), it takes 20-30 seconds to
connect. Once connected everything works great and I can navigate through
directories as quickly as shell. I included this oddity because it seems
related.
Some FTP daemons need to auth with port 113 and it tries to look for a DNS
server.  That's why you are experiencing the latency.  Try to REM out the
flag in FTP conf file or in the loader script (inet or xnet?).

The server configuration is similar but not identical. I realize this isn't
enough information to work with, but I'm hoping that maybe someone has dealt
with this situation before. Or maybe someone could just give me some general
areas to inspect.

Here's some info on the servers:

            OLD             NEW
System      SunOS 5.8       Linux 2.4.2-2
PHP         4.1.2           4.2.2

Thanks!
Jim
