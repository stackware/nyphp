<PRE>I have worked for a technical recruiting (aka headhunter) company for 
the past three years and I can backup the statement below. Also, you 
can't always count on a technical person seeing the resume and 
&quot;understanding&quot; what you have done. At larger firms resumes go through 
Human Resources first as a filter. To them, someone with JDBC, EJB, JSP, 
and J2EE doesn't know Java. But someone with Javascript does. Someone 
with awk, csh, zsh, and grep doesn't know how to write a shell script. 
If they know Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and IRIX they don't know Unix. Etc, 
etc, etc,.

It's not easy to write a resume that spells out everything for a 
non-technical person, yet keeps a technical person from becoming bored 
and still has the required content presented concisely. Really the only 
common ground between human resources and a technical manager is that 
neither wants to read a resume longer than two pages. So where do you 
put all the buzzwords for the search engine? Put a &quot;Key Words&quot; section 
at the bottom of your resume and forget about the &quot;References available 
upon request&quot;, of course they are.

It's a good idea to keep multiple &quot;versions&quot; of your resume that cater 
to different reviewers and skill sets.
