<PRE>Alan,
    Just out of pure curiosity, and utter hatred for IIS...why, may I ask,
are you using it? What can a Microsoft product do that FreeBSD / RedHat
can't?

  I understand if it's a client that is just picky about what is used, but I
think that it would be better in the long run to not waste time with Windows
2000 / IIS and just use something you're familiar with.

    However, I do have experience with IIS and high-load websites, there
isn't too much you can do to tweak the speed, or anything like that... It's
pretty...&quot;bland&quot;. PHP works under Windows, and IIS just fine (not as well as
*nix, I, personally think -- but that's me)

    As for the ISAPI modules, why even use them? Why not write it all in
PHP? Personally, I think that PHP is better then perl/cgi. Let us know what
this module does, and perhaps we can help you to port it over to a PHP
script.

    What bugs are you encountering? Give us the errors, and the code -- I'll
try and help you.

Good luck.
-Bradley Baumann

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP in production on Microsoft IIs


&gt;<i> I have always used PHP with either RedHat or FreeBSD. However, I am
</I>working
&gt;<i> on a site now that is equipped with windows 2000 and IIS. I am considering
</I>&gt;<i> using PHP on this site and was curious to hear from anyone who has any
</I>&gt;<i> expereince using PHP on a reletively high traffic site on IIS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current site gets over 100,000 hits a day. For my own internal
</I>&gt;<i> development I use PHP as a CGI module and I know that eats up a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> resources, I don't think this would be a good option for our production
</I>&gt;<i> server. I know that you can run PHP on IIs as an ISAPI module but the last
</I>&gt;<i> time I looked into this it seemed it was still buggy and not really ready
</I>&gt;<i> for production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you were me, what would you do and why? Of course at this point,
</I>&gt;<i> ditching windows is not an option. It is in the long term plan however.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> Alan
