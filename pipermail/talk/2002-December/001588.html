I'm not sure about you, but having the ability to ssh doesn't really 
mean anything to me. I'd say one of the problems with php is that it
is so loose, you don't really have to know anything about 'programming'
to write it. From my experience, as most non-technical management can't
tell the difference between a really skilled coder and someone who can
use words like 'pro-active' and 'methodology'.

I think to truly be qualified you need to understand many things beyond
syntax, which most people don't get. It seems no one even writes code
for high performance and low resource usage any more. Everyone needs 
their hand held through the most basic of exercises. I'm not sure if 
it's just my opinion and current situation, it just seems like a lot
of people who make a living of programming/scripting web applications
have absolutely no idea what they are doing.

I read a good rant which made a lot of sense to me at
