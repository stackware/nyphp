<PRE>Hi,

As for cert tests, I'd probably do terrible.  I can never remember the
specific syntax.  But I can remember &quot;how&quot; to do something, or at least I
can figure out an approach to try.  Then I look at the object model to see
the specific syntax for that event, method, etc.  That is think is more
important - The Logic.  How does everything tie in together.  Where should
things be done -- client side, server side, business-logic-tier, etc.

As for junior developers not knowing everything . . . isn't that why they
are &quot;junior&quot; level?

Experience comes from experience!  Two people in the same situation will
take the experience differently.  One will sit around whining and say &quot;I
never learned that . . . you don't pay me enough.&quot; and another one will
spend the time to figure it out, looking through books or API's online, or
posting questions on forums.

My $0.04 worth ($0.02 invested in dotcoms that went to $5.00 then back
down to $0.04!!!)

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My personal opinion is 'real Open Source developers doesn't need cert'.
</I>&gt;<i> Just like any other issues, OSS philosophy developed its own unique
</I>&gt;<i> 'certification way' by means of 'pet projects'.  Since most of the OSS
</I>&gt;<i> developers already developing some sort of 'pet projects' for their own,
</I>&gt;<i> this indicates what level of knowledge they have. Certifications are for
</I>&gt;<i> developers who don't have any reference sites or apps to show, and/or
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have education background related to the field at all. If you're
</I>&gt;<i> talented and know how to express yourself, guy sitting accross the table
</I>&gt;<i> on an inverview will going to notice your talent. If they can't notice
</I>&gt;<i> your capabilities, you don't even need to show a certification :-))
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest recruitters to look for the ones with pet projects instead of
</I>&gt;<i> certification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I don't have pet project(I can't even call it pet project)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ive noticed these comments to come from people in their mid-50, early

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  faith in high level languages :-)  Just an observation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I think you are right, the very LAST thing people ever ask when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designing a web app today is what kind of resources in terms of memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  requirements, scalability, etc ... I think its just a case of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market  place that has turned from taking ur time to secure an app to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come in,  deploy tomorrow, fix bugs later if we need you.  I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think its a  case of not knowing what u are doing because today (vs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yesterday) there  are several ways to accomplish one thing, no matter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if you are a junior  developer or senior architect.  There are things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that look pretty and  things that were a late night hack to make it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work, but who is to  decide?  I dont think much has changed, in fact I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got an assignment on  Saturday for a PHP-based quiz for a site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> launching on Monday, Id like to  think my options were to figure out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how well their php.ini was tweeked  or how they are setup but its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something accomplished last nite for  peanuts.  Id like to think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like a PHP+ certificate would help  get more work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for the link, I found it very informative, and enjoy the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion.
