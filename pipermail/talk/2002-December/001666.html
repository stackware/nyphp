<PRE>I completely agree with you, Gerald.

    There is no direct, easy way of making everything compatible with
everything else. It's not your fault, obviously -- it's just a lack of
thought on the other programmer's side.

    Changing the php.ini file around on the fly for specific applications
isn't really a feasible idea, and I realize that. It's an age old problem,
and it just boils down to programmers writing crappy, incompatible code.

-Bradley.

</I>&gt;<i> i wasn't posting about my scripts.  i already write my scripts for

</I>&gt;<i> so far) will run unmodified with the settings mentioned above.

</I>&gt;<i> bugtracking system running correctly yet (mainly because of the
</I>&gt;<i> register_globals requirement, they were written for 3.x, 4.0.x etc).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; register_globals = On
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for the info :).  i compile my own PHP on Mandrake, because
</I>&gt;<i> i need DBG to work, and i don't know how to get DBG to work with
</I>&gt;<i> Mandrake's PHP.  easier to just install my own PHP and apache

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the info is useful though, for reference, and so i know to turn it off

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just curious, what don't you like about Perl?  I started in Perl and
</I>find
&gt;<i> &gt; the two so similar that it was an easy transition.  Perl is a little
</I>more
&gt;<i> &gt; stringent in its requirements but that is not a bad thing IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there *is* a similarity, i agree. PHP was just easier for me since it
</I>&gt;<i> looks so much more like C.  i can't stand the line noise that some
</I>&gt;<i> perl looks like.  but that's just me.  i'm sure if i worked on perl enough
</I>&gt;<i> i'd learn it pretty quickly and use it.  even the line noise i'd get used
