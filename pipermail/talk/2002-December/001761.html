<PRE>IIS is a four letter word as far as I'm concerned. Also everyone needs to realize that as web/PHP developers we are often stuck with what we have, not what we would rather have. If IIS didn't have such a sordid security past we would be running it here and I would have absolutely no say in the matter. I wanted to put Linux on the server and they put Advanced Server 2000 on it. I scream, yet no one hears...

The site is for a very small community college and it gets very few, if any, concurrent hits on the PHP/MySQL portion of it and I have plenty of room for multiple users config wise.

I still think that Alan should use CGI instead of the module. It is flaky.

Thank's Guys
Jessica

</I>Miss/Mrs. Jessiaca Kelly,

Better to use PHP and related softwares on Linux machine rather than on 
Microsoft based OSs :) ? This is like running your Ferrari car on Diesel 
rather than on Gas.I really wonder. Hard to change everything, once set up on Window's 
environment but &quot;Better&quot; to move on Linux.
Thanks,
Anirudh Zala

</I>I suggest running IIS and PHP on Windows 2000 Server, or Advanced Server.
There may be a couple configuration things you might want to look into...
(how many users at a time? etc, etc)
Also, you're going to want to look into MySQL's (or whatever other database
you're using) configuration, too... (again, amount of users at the same
time)...
Those are the only real obvious things I can think of, if I can come up with
anything else, I'll be sure to let you know.
Good luck.
-Brad.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually, both IIS and Cold Fusion will be gone, I just need to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around some of it for now and we only have one production server at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moment to mess around with. I would really like to know if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;phpisapi.dll is relatively stable, and would like to hear if anyone has 
</I>&gt;<i>actually used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it in a production environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Alan,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I use the module on a apache server 1.3.xx on a Win Advanced Server 2000 
</I>&gt;<i>and it is a bit flaky at times. It seems to just stop working. The site 
</I>&gt;<i>does not get a lot of hits and the PHP seems to crap out when you need to 
</I>&gt;<i>enter info into a MySQL DB. This doesn't happen often but about once a week 
</I>&gt;<i>and is frustrating the person entering the data (myself also!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have been told to avoid using the module from persons on this list 
</I>&gt;<i>(Thank's Daniel!) because of this and am currently trying to get it to work 
</I>&gt;<i>as CGI on my test server then I'll switch the other server over.
</I>&gt;<i>
