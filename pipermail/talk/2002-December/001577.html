It's funny that you mention how much PHP is related to other technologies. 
While I was home over Thanksgiving, my dad (who had taught me C in the early
days) had wanted to get a crash course in PHP.  Thinking this would be a good
way to spend some father-son time, I said sure (I expected him to catch on
quickly) but as I began talking about PHP and such, I realized how many
smaller things it's dependant on - SQL, HTML/etc, Apache interaction, MySQL
(in this case) interaction.

&gt;<i> Stating that SQL is mandatory along with Unix admining is not pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> neutral in my opinion but there are parts that should be included with a 
</I>&gt;<i> PHP Developer certification ... you then have the option that if a

</I>&gt;<i> if its against the &quot;better&quot; PHP programmer.  (Would this be true?)  
</I>
In some cases, I think so.  But as many of us have come across, there are
many different facets of PHP - possibly &quot;PHP Designer&quot;, &quot;PHP Developer&quot;, and
&quot;PHP Architect&quot; (divied up further into Oracle/MySQL/PostGreSQL/etc) tracks? 
Sure, each overlaps a bit, but there really is a focus on signigicantly
different technologies in each area.  And, as I found, trying to teach/learn
PHP, as simply a language, is about exciting and rewarding as
teaching/learning C (ok, I know - it's fun for some).

&gt;<i> I think most/some of certifications are such a sham, much like the 
</I>&gt;<i> wireless networking exams now, but there are not many options when 
</I>&gt;<i> people have not met face to face and a developer is working project to 
</I>&gt;<i> project for his paycheck.  Good personality, clean certificate, and a 
</I>&gt;<i> smile? :-)
</I>
Sure.  A cert, while ambiguous to the developers themselves, can often cut
through a lot of the uncertainty that an employer has about an employer.
