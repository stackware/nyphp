<PRE>I'm 20. heh.
My frustration has come up due to dealing with a large amount of 
developers that have no idea what they are doing. For instance, in a 
content management system, there was a text area where the client could 
enter in text, to be shown over the web. Instead of converting a line 
break character to an html line break tag on insert of the text, it is 
done on every page view. This is just a miniscule piece of the code I 
have been forced to fix over the last 6 months. People who refuse to use 
CVS or anything that doesn&#8217;t have a gui. Refuse to learn how to learn 
how to use FTP. It's the small things, they add up quickly.

I think certification could be a good tool, but someone else made a very 
valid point, PHP alone isn't really a challenge, but you would need to 
quiz on SQL/HTML etc. It would be kind of like having JavaScript 
certification without mentioning the DOM, it's something else entirely.
