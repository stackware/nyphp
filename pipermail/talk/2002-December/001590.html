</I>Ive noticed these comments to come from people in their mid-50, early 
60's who have spent more than 20 years on C/C++ and have absolutely no 
faith in high level languages :-)  Just an observation.  

But I think you are right, the very LAST thing people ever ask when 
designing a web app today is what kind of resources in terms of memory 
requirements, scalability, etc ... I think its just a case of the market 
place that has turned from taking ur time to secure an app to come in, 
deploy tomorrow, fix bugs later if we need you.  I don't think its a 
case of not knowing what u are doing because today (vs. yesterday) there 
are several ways to accomplish one thing, no matter if you are a junior 
developer or senior architect.  There are things that look pretty and 
things that were a late night hack to make it work, but who is to 
decide?  I dont think much has changed, in fact I got an assignment on 
Saturday for a PHP-based quiz for a site launching on Monday, Id like to 
think my options were to figure out how well their php.ini was tweeked 
or how they are setup but its something accomplished last nite for 
peanuts.  Id like to think something like a PHP+ certificate would help 
get more work.    

Thanks for the link, I found it very informative, and enjoy the 
discussion.
