<PRE>Just wondering why can't you point or redirect to the resulting page on a 
system running php and redhat and versa.  This will can make the transition 
a little more smooth.

 &gt;     Just out of pure curiosity, and utter hatred for IIS...why, may I 
ask,
 &gt; are you using it? What can a Microsoft product do that FreeBSD / RedHat
 &gt; can't?

Believe me, I am no fan of IIS but in this particular case, the site was
written in Cold Fusion, which in turn needs to run on IIs (for licensing
reasons). The real reason I am stuck with IIs for the moment is that the
site I am working on just has too much to rewrite in PHP right now. I plan
to make a transition slowly to PHP on a RedHat machine once we have all the
major site functionality rebuilt in PHP. Until then however, I want to
implement some important features on the site and begin rewriting other apps
in PHP to work alongside the Cold Fusion stuff until we are ready to make
that final move. So technically there is nothing that Windows IIs can do
that FreeBSD or Redhat can do right now except run our only licensed copy of
Cold Fusion (sucks. I know) :(


 &gt;     As for the ISAPI modules, why even use them? Why not write it all in
 &gt; PHP? Personally, I think that PHP is better then perl/cgi. Let us know
what
 &gt; this module does, and perhaps we can help you to port it over to a PHP
 &gt; script.

What I am referring to here is that it is my understanding there are two
ways to install PHP on windows with IIs. You can run it as a CGI, that is to
map the .php files to execute the php.exe file, or map the .php files to
execute the /sapi/php4isapi.dll file. With the former, you load the whole
php.exe executable on every invocation on PHP, with the other PHP runs as a
module in the server memory. I remeber a while ago, the module was not all
that stable and was not reccomended for production systems. I was hoping to
find out if that is still the case, and if anyone had any luck doing so on a
busy server (100,000 hits a day).

Thanks,
Alan

 &gt;     What bugs are you encountering? Give us the errors, and the code --
I'll

 &gt; Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP in production on Microsoft IIs
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; I have always used PHP with either RedHat or FreeBSD. However, I am
 &gt; working
 &gt; &gt; on a site now that is equipped with windows 2000 and IIS. I am
considering
 &gt; &gt; using PHP on this site and was curious to hear from anyone who has any
 &gt; &gt; expereince using PHP on a reletively high traffic site on IIS.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; The current site gets over 100,000 hits a day. For my own internal
 &gt; &gt; development I use PHP as a CGI module and I know that eats up a lot of
 &gt; &gt; resources, I don't think this would be a good option for our production
 &gt; &gt; server. I know that you can run PHP on IIs as an ISAPI module but the
last
 &gt; &gt; time I looked into this it seemed it was still buggy and not really
ready
 &gt; &gt; for production.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; So if you were me, what would you do and why? Of course at this point,
 &gt; &gt; ditching windows is not an option. It is in the long term plan however.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,
 &gt; &gt; Alan
