<PRE>Hi,

My personal opinion is 'real Open Source developers doesn't need cert'. Just like any other
issues, OSS philosophy developed its own unique 'certification way' by means of 'pet projects'. 
Since most of the OSS developers already developing some sort of 'pet projects' for their own,
this indicates what level of knowledge they have. Certifications are for developers who don't have
any reference sites or apps to show, and/or doesn't have education background related to the field
at all. If you're talented and know how to express yourself, guy sitting accross the table on an
inverview will going to notice your talent. If they can't notice your capabilities, you don't even
need to show a certification :-))
I suggest recruitters to look for the ones with pet projects instead of certification.

PS: I don't have pet project(I can't even call it pet project)

Best


Kayra Otaner
