Hello NYPHP,

Greetings to All,

I need to time how long it takes to fill out a registration form, from
when it is called to submission. I am trying to compare the time frame difference
between the form being manually filled out versus an automated script.

Any ideas or direction about how to do this would be enormously
appreciated.

Put the timestamp of when the page was first served as a hidden variable 
in the form. Then compare it to the time when it was submitted (after 
completed).

<input type="hidden" name="served" value="<?=time()?>">

Isn't there one equal sign too many for value?

Thanks for the hint. Shows that I neither know the shortcuts nor what output 
tim() produces.

Just keep on coding....don't pay attention to the guy brabbling in the corner.

Count me out of that "love".

I hate seeing that in code because I always have to change it to 
what's correct.

If you put a time stamp in the form, you should also include a "check"
to make sure the time was not changed and/or forged (which is very
easy to do).
An easy way to do this is to include another hidden field that is an
md5 hash of the time plus a secret pass phrase that only resides on
the server. When the form is submitted, you take the submitted time
plus the pass phrase md5 hash and make sure it matches the submitted
md5 hash.
Ideally your md5 hash would use more than 2 pieces of information, but
you get the idea.

mikesz:

To time form submission is a reasonable safeguard check.

It's nothing to time it, just check server-side when the form is 
served to the browser and when the form is submitted back to the 
server. Here's a demo with code:

Hi Michele

Thanks for your help, it was and still is very much appreciated. Just to let 
you know I am using a UK providor named PROTX and they have thing called 
VSPxxxxx-KIT which follows a lot of what you discribe plus lots of PHPcoded 
examples of all the bits and bobs needed for the shopping cart. So once 
again thank you for your help.

Paul

Subject: [nycphp-talk] new vs clone Performance
Message-ID: <00ab01c9289a$ababd6d0$03038470$@com>

Hi all,

Out of curiosity, I wanted to get some benchmarks on using the new operator
vs cloning.  I wrote a simple script, attached, which is fun to play with.
Upshot:  clone is faster if used correctly (and depending on the object's
operations).  Also some interesting observations in the script itself, and
I'm interested in hearing other's observations/experiences.

By the way, PHP Meetup tonight at Pound & Pence:  http://php.meetup.com/430/

See you there.

Best,

By faster, how much faster do you mean?

I never really thought of doing this kind of optimization, but it
would be pretty easy to re-pattern object creation _if it was
significantly faster_. The script ran out of memory on my Mac, what

Run the script :)

It depends a lot on the class (and the use of __clone() and the heaviness of the class initialization in __construct()) but I was seeing consistent 20% - 30% across various classes.  It's fun to play around with, using various builtin classes, and user defined ones.  Sometimes, though, the increase was dramatic (use stdClass for example).

Put $OCount to something smaller, like 100,000 or 10,000

Significantly faster will be a hard thing to quantify.  Doing $OCount runs of 1,000,000 typically yielded only a fraction of seconds improvements (and that's when creating 1 million objects which no application really does).  So I'm not sure how much of a real improvement this would have for a typical application.

That said, the reason I started investigating this was because of APC.  Theory being, create objects upon first request when the server comes online, cache them in APC, and then clone them as needed during subsequent requests.  Depending on the object's initialization pattern, this could yield some real per-request performance gains.

Of course, investigating APC's performance is TBD.  Long story short, APC's dopy serialization/un-serialization of variables may make this all moot.

Hi, all:

I'm wondering what the best way to do this is (may not be cURL):

I'm currently building an API to connect to an HTTPS server.  My first  
script POSTs login data as cleartext by way of cURL.  The HTTPS server  
throws a secure cookie back at me, set to expire within 24 hours.  So  
far, so good.

Within that 24 hour period, I'd like a separate script (on the same  
server) to make subsequent requests; passing the authentication along  
such that HTTPS knows who I am.

What's the best way to do that?

Am I trying to re-invent the wheel here?

I think this is just for test metrics. While it is right that one can do that 
I doubt it applies in this case.

Rahmin,

As best practice you should secure your login data by sending it over 
https. 

Curl handles cookies rather well and should work for your needs.

Elijah Insua

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Blog Posts with Embedded Content
Message-ID: <00ed01c928c3$7715a210$6540e630$@com>

Hello,

So people post blogs, which may include a youtube link or image or href
embedded.

In one part of the application, they want to show only the first X number of
characters, before forcing a user to login.  So we need to cut the submitted
text at this character count, yet, of course, not cut in the middle of a
tag.

This has turned into a considerable annoyance and I'm wondering if anyone
has a quick tip/pointer to a resource to solve this - without writing
excessive text parsing code.

My general plan (although I hope someone has something better) is to:

-- write a function like DeltaOffsets( $Raw, $Stripped)  where $Raw is the
$Raw post and $Stripped is the post run through strip_tags.

-- the function would return an array with the positions relative to the
$Raw post of where the stripped text has started/stopped.

-- then upon writing to the browser, we could intelligently insert stripped
tags up to the cut-off-point of real text (ie, not counting the stripped
tags).

Although this seems like a lot of work for something that must be done all
the time, right?  Thoughts on how the other blog engines handle this?
There's got to be an easier way...?

Yes, security is another issue...

Interesting question, I have searched unsuccessfully for a solution to
this in the past with no luck.

I hacked together a solution for you, but I am not sure I would put it
in production.  It is reasonably safe because it escapes everything it
doesn't recognize as a tag.  If you use it, I would filter out all but
a whitelist of tags (e.g. a,b,i,blockquote,strong) before passing it
to the function.

See the code at:
http://php.pastebin.com/f7f5262cb

The safest approach is probably to pass the html through tidy, and
then into DOM, and traverse and count the length of text nodes, but
that would be quite slow if you ran it on every request.

John Campbell

Right, +1 for Tidy and DOM, it's the "real" way to do it. You won't
need to do it on every request -- you can either store the summary
itself as a separate text field, or store the length of the summary as
an integer.

This is crying out for a web service: The Excerpter. POST markup, get
the first X display characters back as a response, with embedded HTML
intact.

Hi,

Does anyone on the list have experience integrating Drupal 6 & KnowledgeTree?

I've installed Knowledge Tree and the KT Module. It seems to work, except that when I connect from within Drupal, the output is restricted to a very small area of the screen and there are no scrollbars.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Restian PHP on IIS with encoded urls
Message-ID: <48ED15E1.7040204@umn.edu>

I'm writing a web services application on PHP 5.2. I develop on 
Linux/Apache but our test/production servers are running IIS 6 So I'm 
kind of clueless about how to configure IIS.

Thanks in advance for any assistance.

The problem that I'm having is that IIS is decoding encoded portions of 
my urls before they hit php, and that is making parsing an encoded rest 
url very difficult.

I did google this and found a server variable "UNENCODED_URL" but it 
doesn't seem to be populated on my server. I found some references to 
the IIS Metabase, but nothing about what I would change to get what I 
want out of the server.


Short version of the question:
How do I get the original encoded URL in IIS?


The URL I'm parsing is:
http://localhost/resources/services.php/ttaf/transform/http%3A%2F%2Ficitest1.education.umn.edu%2Fici%2Fwelcome%2Fcaptions_ici_ttf.xml/http%3A%2F%2Ficitest1.education.umn.edu%2Fici%2Fwelcome%2Ftranscript.xsl
Which I want to parse to
    ttaf
    transform
    http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fici%2Fwelcome%2Fcaptions_ici_ttf.xml
    http%3A%2F%2Ficitest1.education.umn.edu%2Fici%2Fwelcome%2Ftranscript.xsl


Long explanation if needed/useful:

To reduce the complexity of maintaining web server environments on 
several machines (developer and servers) we try to do everything inside 
of native PHP. This means no mod_rewrite or similar tools unless they 
are irreplaceable.


In Apache I get
    [REQUEST_URI] => 
/resources/services.php/ttaf/transform/http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fsandbox%2Fflashxslt%2Fcaptions_ici_ttf.xml/http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fsandbox%2Fflashxslt%2Ftranscript.xsl
    [SCRIPT_NAME] => /resources/services.php
 which I can then parse out.

In IIS I get:
[PATH_INFO] => 
/ttaf/transform/http:/icitest1.education.umn.edu/ici/welcome/captions_ici_ttf.xml/http:/icitest1.education.umn.edu/ici/welcome/transcript.xsl
    [PATH_TRANSLATED] => 
c:/inetpub/wwwroot/ttaf/transform/http:/icitest1.education.umn.edu/ici/welcome/captions_ici_ttf.xml/http:/icitest1.education.umn.edu/ici/welc
    [ORIG_PATH_INFO] => 
/resources/services.php/ttaf/transform/http:/icitest1.education.umn.edu/ici/welcome/captions_ici_ttf.xml/http:/icitest1.education.umn.edu/ici/welcome/transcript.xsl
   [ORIG_PATH_TRANSLATED] => 
c:\inetpub\wwwroot\resources\services.php\ttaf\transform\http:\icitest1.education.umn.edu\ici\welcome\captions_ici_ttf.xml\http:\icitest1.education.umn.edu\ici\welcome\transcript.xsl

But they're all already decoded.

Thanks!
Joelle

cURL + preg would do the trick I'd imagine.

Pretty trivial to write one if you can come up with a decent  
definition for "defaced".

For what's supposed to be a static page, you could use "Changed" as  
the definition for defaced.

If the content changes, you could test for some string that should  
always be there.

Either one can probably be tested in just a handful of lines of PHP.

I use Google Alerts, and use a search query like:

site:example.com viagra OR levitra OR cialis OR penis OR hacked

It's not fool proof, but it takes about 10 seconds to setup.

interesting :) but yeah PHP is not needed.

also md5/sha1 might do the trick, combined with curl

GOODHASH=399257fc956120012baf094ffd7eed9b; \
HASH=`curl -s www.yoursite.com | md5sum`; \
if [ "$HASH" != "$GOODHASH" ]; then mail -s "uh-oh" you at yoursite.com; fi

where you first get the value of "GOODHASH" with the same command as in HASH 
above.

enjoy,

This isn't going to answer your question, but you can pretty much
guarantee that the token 'http:' isn't going to be part of a url, so
you could use that to split PATH_INFO into its component parts.
Kludgey, but you could make it work...

The bestr i have used is guru.com but it's hard to get established.   
Once you get a few jobs it gets easier.

Thanks to all for your suggestions. Since the sites are usually dynamic...I kinda like Tim's suggestion of placing a string on the page, perhaps in a set of comment tags, and parsing for that string.

A little OT, but since it will most likely be programmed in PHP, I'm 
looking to see what others have developed and/or used.

I need to setup an "Intranet" for my FTJ.  In this Intranet I was going to 
include a bunch of things, like nagios, cacti, and a wiki.

The problem is that the requirements for the Intranet go well beyond what 
a simple wiki can accomplish.  Not only do we need a wiki for 
documentation, but we also need a way to:

 	- Share files with versioninng
 	- Create tickets for tasks (RT?)
 	- Track bugs (bugzilla?) and new feature requests for development
 	- "Project manage" new development projects
 	- etc.

I was going to setup tikiwiki or dokuwiki, along with bugzilla, and 
perhaps RT, and a few other things, but I was wondering if anyone could 
recommend an "all in one" solution that includes wiki+file sharing+project 
manangement tools+ticketing+task tracking, etc.

If not, I'll most likely go the independent software route.  Thanks for 
any suggestions!

This combines much of the wiki info.

If you need to share files with versioning. you have two options. The first
is SharePoint. This is expensive, especially for a PHP shop. The second is
just to stored the files ina a Doc folder in subversion. Then you can just
serve up subversion over https to view the files. If you have MACS accessing
this repo be sure to read this:

Considered the web-based SVN repository, but were looking to see if there 
was another solution.  What are your thoughts on tikiwiki?

Sorry for the OT, but this is in-fact PHP related as it covers a PHP

Hi Matt,

You can combine KnowledgeTree, Drupal, Subversion, WebDAV / Apache
ModDav, WebSVN, Eventum (to do over I'd use Drupal tracker, or
something else), FreeMind, MediaWiki, and TaskJuggler into a complete
platform.  Still, it's a lot of work and depends entirely on
adoption/fitting into the organizations workflows.  I did not get a
chance to actually document or share much of the "how to" of that
system, but hope to someday.  There are a lot of possibilities out
there, but no matter how well crafted the solution is, the success is
going to depend more on how motivated and engaged people are in seeing
the system meet their needs.

I would have to say that even among big/enterprise solutions, there is
not a single product that does everything you mention.

One other thought is that Ubuntu has a pretty good system (in several
parts) that can stand as a model -- but it's neither available to
install, nor a single solution.  It bears repeating that their system
too is highly dependent on agreements between educated participants
about methods and procedures of the system.

I haven't looked, but do ZoHo (zoho.com) have some of these pieces? They 
have also recently opened their platform for third-party apps too (which 
is very interesting to me).

Message-ID: <79812751.20081011205137@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello NYPHP,

  One of my sites went down yesterday with "Out of Bandwidth". When I
  checked into it, a badguy had hijacked an application folder called
  /xml that usually contains one php file that serves the application
  menu system. I have no idea why the software developer chose this
  method. The /xml folder is read only (and has always been read only)
  Yesterday, in addition to the single php file, /xml contained a
  subfolder called odg which contained a porn distribution application
  with thousands of images that it was serving the planet though
  mediacatch.com and myhostdyn.com among others. I have no idea how
  the badguy got in and my ISP doesn't have a clue either. I got them
  to delete the junk because the badguy used a Unix system account to
  create the junk and I was unable to delete with the permissions I
  have.

  Now with that gone, I decided to add a .htaccess file to further
  restrict access to the /xml folder but when I did, the .htaccess
  file does not respond at all. Here is what I put in there:

Options -Indexes

order deny,allow

<files "*.*">
Deny from All
</files>

<files "*.*">
Allow from 127.0.0.1 localhost
</files>

I expected that if I tried to access that folder directly that I would
get a 403 but instead I got the application intro screen?

I checked my test system also and when I do a directory the /xml
folder, it shows me the content of the folder which is yet another
outcome unexpected.

The question I have is Does a folder named /xml have any special
status or significance on a linux box that would cause it to act
differently than say, an /includes folder that usually generates a
blank screen?

Any clues would be greatly appreciated. Notice that I haven't gotten
into the hack at all, no idea how it happened and the ISP is really
vague about what might have happened but is pointing the finger to my
app and, of course, his server is completely secure, btw, its a shared
server. My guess if that the bad guy ripped off the system account and
ran amok on it but nobody is even hinting that this could be a
possibility, to the contrary. Getting back to the /xml, why would I be
getting the bizarre behavior from it?

TIA

There is a setting in the Apache config that prevents the listing of 
directories. In a production system that should be always turned off.
Also, IIRC you can specify the name of the access file in the config as well, 
so it may not always be .htaccess, but I cannot think of any plausible reason 
to change that. But that may be worthwhile to check out.

Oh, and at your earliest convenience change the hosting company. If they 
cannot tell you how such a takeover happened then I wonder what they charge 
you money for. Anyone with a PC can do that type of hosting...

HA! My thoughts exactly. I was blown away when they suggested my
scripts without ever checking their log files... Unbelievable! I
thought it was a nobrainer to track such a blatant intrusion
especially when the time frame of when the breach occurred is known
almost to the second.

On one hand i can understand how the host wouldn't know exactly how the
files got there - but the file ownership and logs should give much more
information away and they should know if it was a shell attack, a remote
file inclusion, or any number of common attacks. 

from your side though - are you using a common code base or module that
might be vulnerable, or maybe an old version of a now patched software
setup? if you are, what i use then might be something to look for in a
web host - we use an intrusion detection system that combines
mod_security with some well written rules along with some other software
that monitors everything. With that in place although I'm sure there is
still a way for someone to find a way into your system, it's incredibly
less likely, and the automated attackers would most certainly not work. 

to answer your question about the .htaccess file - there is also a
possibility that the host does not have all of the AllowOverride
directive active for your hosting account. in that case some items would
work and others wouldn't.

next up the content of your .htaccess
it's probably not what you wanted to do and i'm nearly positive that the
deny/allow isn't working
> -Indexes
- turns off directory listings
you may also need to change this to another name - thus triggering the
default not to be shown
> DirectoryIndex index.php 
 - that will make the only file index.php that will show up when you did
http://host/xml/ (correct me if i'm thinking the other directive it's
early)

this totally sucks and i'm sorry to hear this happened.  It sounds like
you'll need a crash course in Apache configuration...

My advice to you is to do a couple things:

a) Most importantly, consider *finding a new host*, because
  1) they should have records of all connectivity to that server
  2) their system is obviously insecure and when it comes to server security
i believe that hosts have a '1 strike and you are out' grace period
  3) the hacker probably got in through ssh if he was able to set
permissions to the point where you were not able to delete them (they were
probably under ownership of the account he used to hack the system)

b) assuming that the .htaccess is local to the /xml directory only
  1) (if you haven't done so already) create a .htaccess file in the root
directory and put 'Options -Indexes in that
  2) IIRC this: "<files "*.*">Deny from All</files>" is useless because
"<files "*.*">Allow from 127.0.0.1 localhost</files>" will override it WITH
the following caveat: the *main* apache config has to have AllowOverride All
specified

The use of .htaccess files can be disabled completely by setting the
> AllowOverride<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#allowoverride>directive to
> none:
>

that means you could make changes to your .htaccess file all day long and
nothing will change (which i think is the problem on both machines, but not
exactly sure since I don't have specifics of file names, references to those
file names, etc)

  3) if your .htaccess file is working correctly i think you want something
more along the lines of

<FilesMatch "\..+$">
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from All
Allow from 127.0.0.1 localhost
</files>

Just off the top of my head though

Good luck.

Mike,

Yeah, I've ran into hosts like that before.  As soon as they refuse to
accept even the remote possibility that they are at fault it's time to move
on, especially when it comes to a hack to that extent.

Did they even offer any logs that you could review so you could "fix your
software" (since they say that's at fault) ?

If you are ok with being a sys admin and ~25$ a month isn't too much, I
recommend getting a VPS through knownhost.com  I've been dealing with them
for about 2 years now and have never had a problem last longer than an hour,
and that was only one time.

You'll have dedicated IP addresses, dedicated mail server, dedicated DNS,
and just about anything else you want to install.  The biggest up side is no
chance of getting labeled as spam, or being at the mercy of someone elses
whims, you'll have complete control over php settings and apache configs,
and you'll be able to host however many domains,subdomains, etc you want.

No, I'm not affiliated with them, nor employed by them, I just a *very*
satisfied customer.  I originally started at the $20/month plan and have
since then upgraded twice.

Good luck

Maybe it was not a hack, but the hoster who rededicated your server space to 
someone else to rake in some more dough (pure speculation). Can you let us 
know who that hosting company is?

Infrenion.

That would really, really suck and I can see the plausibility of it
too. I thought that it was weird that ONLY that folder on my site was
owned by the UNIX system.

I did a search on the "path" that the bad guys are still using to
pound my site and that folder that is gone now and get thousands of
error, not to mention my error log filling up with 304s and 403s

"Results 11 - 20 of about 27,600 for /xml/odg/."

 They are all referencing warning messages/conditions from trying to
 access the junk that was but no longer on my site.

I tried this, working through using both DOM and Tidy, and combinations of each - no luck.  The problem is getting the differential between the two versions of the text.

Yeah, I agree - this has turned into a royal problem, and one that seems as though it'd had to be solved already.

At the end of the day, what would be a very handy library - an object/etc that would store the text, in various forms, include various manipulation methods on it, meta data, etc, etc.  I had written something like this for MIME, but would not look forward to doing it for HTML/etc.

This is a solvable problem, but the problem needs to be really well
defined.  I assume you want to snip the html, to show a preview.  If
you leave things like youtube videos and images, then the post could
be really long without much text.  Why do you need the differential
between the two versions?  As soon as you pass something through tidy,
getting the differential is impossible because it can change the html
in unpredictable ways.  Not cutting in the middle of a tag is pretty
easy to solve, just iterate and keep track of the open tags on a
stack.

You missed NYCBSDCON, and a pitsburg perl conference.

Debianconf 10 is supposed to be in NYC. However devbianconf8 was this
year so I aasume that will occur in 2010.

Nothing else I know of.

Forget diffs and HTML text, this problem totally ate up all my time at
a startup where a JavaScript WYSIWYG editor was the only choice for
generating a marked-up document. May I suggest Markdown [1,2] + the
Showdown preview panel [3]. Markdown is a very light syntax for
generating HTML documents, Showdown gives you a preview of your
document while you're editing the textarea. I have already converted
one custom CMS to Markdown and I think it's been quite successful.

Message-ID: <b76252690810130738g5b3512daha9a25d21baea4447@mail.gmail.com>

I'm interested in playing around with singular value decomposition of
matrices, and wondering:

Does anyone here use this on a regular basis, and for what? I'm pretty
much vector/matrix illiterate, so feel free to mention the obvious.

And can you point me to an existing library in PHP (or better yet, a
PHP extension) that handles the math?

LinuxWorld used to be in NYC at the Javits Center then it moved to Boston 
for awhile. Now I think its only on the west coast.

Yeah, its annoying...


UPDATE: Did some checking and it looks like its been renamed 
opensourceworld, still on the west coast only.

The biggest problem I've seen, that isn't solved by a switch to
markdown or any other meta-markup technique, is that CMS users
increasingly just want to paste in HTML snippets that include embedded
objects, and have them work.

Think YouTube, Vimeo, Google spreadsheets, Wufoo forms, all that crap.

Markdown is great -- GREAT -- if you have enlightened editors and
copywriters who agree that it's easier to use a simple syntax in order
to create consistent results. It can even be combined with a WYSIWYG
rich-text editor to get the best of both worlds.

But it falls down as soon as you ask non-technical people to use it in
place of HTML, because they don't really understand what HTML or
Markdown is and why they should care, they just want to embed their
widgets and move on.

What Hans is looking for is a way to reliably get just the first few
"lines" of any HTML document, whether it is properly HTML-formatted or
not, without truncating embedded elements.

Oh yeah, I'm totally going to use this stuff at cocktail parties.

"And what do you do?"
"I'm investigating the use of singular value decomposition algorithms
to correctly predict relationships between entities in a matrix. How
about you?"

That should go swimmingly.

Hey, all. I wanted to introduce myself. I'm an experienced programmer
(remember ASP, before dont net?) with little formal training, so often
referred to as a hacker. I'm a professional Front End Dev - XHTML, CSS,
JS - now tackling PHP and loving it. A couple coworkers recommended this
list, so I'll be eavesdropping.

I'm looking to go thru a book or two and need some help. I know all
about loops, conditional statements, and the basics of programming. I
understand the concepts behind OOP, but have limited experience with
actually using it. I immediately grasped the basics of the PHP syntax
but am starting to balk at the double colon meaning a static class and
the single vs double arrow... So I guess I'm looking for something
intermediate, and wondering if anyone can make a suggestions?

Thanks,

Corey

What about it? Do you want to go to it? Are you suggesting nyphp gets
a table at it?

I would recommend an older book - the Deitel book - Perl How to Program.
Amazon has it
(http://www.amazon.com/Perl-How-Program-Harvey-Deitel/dp/0130284181/ref=cm_cr
_pr_product_top), and there are reviews on their site that are very
favorable.

Professor Porciello,

I'm quite confused here. The book is called programming perl, and the
cover indicated it also has a Python edition to it. Also your
responding to an email on a php list about a person that wants to
learn PHP better.

So, does this book have a PHP section? Are you suggesting that this is
the best book on OOP out there and the OP would be best served
learning OOP theory from it?

There is one negative review on Amazon saying that the authors seem to
rewrite the same book over and over again in different languages, and
that perl due to its weirdness is not well served by this book. IMHO
That *MIGHT* would serve as a positive review in this case, because
the problem with perl is you can write it in any paradim you want
,procedural, functional, OO, etc. If this book is designed around
generic OOP principles that apply to other languages, instead of
teaching you all the perlisms, both good and bad, then it might have
merit to a PHP Programmer

Corey,

Just out of curosity, do you disagree with the syntax of static
function, or just not understand their purpose? Can you suggest a
syntax you would prefer? The syntax btw is taken from C++. It is
obtuse on one hand, but on the other hand its immediatly clear your
calling a static function for a class and not a member function of an
object.

Regards,

Justin Dearing

Yeah gmail didn't thread it for me and I didn't put two and two together.

Oh, I don't disagree with the syntax, I was just saying I'd reached the
end of what I could figure out myself, and needed some help. The problem
I've run into is that my knowledge carries me to the last third of most
PHP intro books I've looked at. Hardly seems worth the money.

Gotta check, did you read the online manual?
Specifically http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php, but the
entire Language Reference section is a must-read if you are new to php
and want to make sure you have a comprehensive grasp of the language.

It seems like you already know a lot about programming, and just need
to find the "php way" to do things. The manual has been answering
those questions for over ten years.

Professor Porciello,

I'm quite confused here. The book is called programming perl, and the
cover indicated it also has a Python edition to it. Also your
responding to an email on a php list about a person that wants to
learn PHP better.

So, does this book have a PHP section? Are you suggesting that this is
the best book on OOP out there and the OP would be best served
learning OOP theory from it?

There is one negative review on Amazon saying that the authors seem to
rewrite the same book over and over again in different languages, and
that perl due to its weirdness is not well served by this book. IMHO
That *MIGHT* would serve as a positive review in this case, because
the problem with perl is you can write it in any paradim you want
,procedural, functional, OO, etc. If this book is designed around
generic OOP principles that apply to other languages, instead of
teaching you all the perlisms, both good and bad, then it might have
merit to a PHP Programmer

Corey,

Just out of curosity, do you disagree with the syntax of static
function, or just not understand their purpose? Can you suggest a
syntax you would prefer? The syntax btw is taken from C++. It is
obtuse on one hand, but on the other hand its immediatly clear your
calling a static function for a class and not a member function of an
object.

Regards,

Justin Dearing

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Timeouts ... how to get around it?
Message-ID: <91916458.20081014135726@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello NYPHP,

  I have an array that has 13000 email addresses. For now, its in the
  script but will be in a database table eventually. It is a list of
  known bad guys.

  I have a database table with 9000 records and one of the fields is
  an email address.

  In PHP I am using a foreach to loop through the array and do a
  database lookup to try to find any matching emails.

  I am using this query inside the foreach loop:

        $res = ("SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE `email` = '$email2Chk'");
        $numRows = mysql_num_rows($res);
        if ( !empty($numRows ))


  It processes about 12000  addresses in the array and the script times out.

  Anyone have a better idea for doing this task?

  TIA for any help.

First of all you will want to index your database.  I am guessing the  
query is taking forever due to it not having indexes.

Also I would suggest that you do this

$res = ("SELECT * FROM table WHERE email = ' ". email2chk." ' ";

also I would make sure you have no duplicates in the database by  
setting a UNIQUE on the email column.

Doing these things should speed up the site however note that if you  
check this on every page load it will be resource intensive.

also what is $email2Chk is it a string or your array of emails?

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

$email2Chk is an array element. I thought it was but email is not
indexed. Weird, they index a lot of stuff that doesn't matter but
email is missing....

mikez,

I would suggest you break this down a bit, for instance instead of running
13000 sql queries, do a simple look up using IN.

For example:

'SELECT * FROM table WHERE email IN ("' . implode('","',$emailsArray) . '")'

Also, selecting columns by name gives a performance boost.
(I'm also guessing that you are going to be performing an action on the
email by its id)

'SELECT email_id FROM table WHERE email in ("' . implode('","',$emailsArray)
. '")'

If this query gets too large, you can always break the loop down into
smaller increments
so instead of processing all of the email addresses at once, you could break
it into 1000
increments.

These techniques combined with the indexing should speed things up for you.

Oh and by the way, if this is running on every page load I would add some
sort of caching routine
so it only runs every 15 minutes or so.

Hope it helps!

Message-ID: <441539530.20081014154122@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello NYPHP,

I am seeing that Registration forms are taking a huge beating from
scammers and spammers today, especially forum sites. I spend most
of my time lately collecting and filtering data to find the freaks
before they find the membership. Use to be and "every now and again"
but now its thousands per day and you can't tell now whether its a
robot or cheap labor doing the form input. Aside from my own sites
that are getting pounded daily I have several client site that average
500 badguy hits a day now and those are just the ones I have a
"known badguy" status, they are hijacking and adding new addresses
everyday, spammers mostly, all forum sites. Just unbelievable, and of
course, mustn't forget my recent episode with the porno  pirate hijacking
my server is still giving me no joy either.

Anybody else having these kinds of problems?
  
I think someone suggested (here I think) that the scammer/spammers
were using CURL to access the database directly, is that possible? If
so how, and how can that be prevented.

In the trap that I have set up, I log the contents of $_REQUEST but I
don't see anything unusual about the submission and all of a sudden
the bad guy ends up in the system as a "Registered" user bypassing all
the captcha security and "moderation" step in the approval process,
like they are accessing the database directly but I don't see any of
this database being passed in $_REQUEST? Any ideas? Or where else I
need to be looking to trap the data that is being passed?

TIA for any pointers.

Hi,

Getting those 13000 into the db would be a good thing.
Then you could index the email cols in both tables, and
just do a join on the tables.

In the meantime, maybe try getting ALL of the email values
from the db into an associative array, (email => 1) and looping
over an "array_key_exists". When you find a key match, THEN
look up the full record in the db.

hth,
Glenn

2 more efficient ways:

1 - mysql solution - (You will have to look up the exact syntax) -
select table1.email from table1 where table1.email in (select
table2.email from table2) into table3.  This will give you all the
matches in table3.  Table1 should both probably be indexed on email, but
you can do some testing to see if that matters.

2 - 1950's solution - create 2 sorted text files containing the email
addresses.  Then march through both in PHP, looking for matches.

Hello NYPHP,

  I have an array that has 13000 email addresses. For now, its in the
  script but will be in a database table eventually. It is a list of
  known bad guys.

  I have a database table with 9000 records and one of the fields is
  an email address.

  In PHP I am using a foreach to loop through the array and do a
  database lookup to try to find any matching emails.

  I am using this query inside the foreach loop:

        $res = ("SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE `email` = '$email2Chk'");
        $numRows = mysql_num_rows($res);
        if ( !empty($numRows ))


  It processes about 12000  addresses in the array and the script times
out.

  Anyone have a better idea for doing this task?

  TIA for any help.

The previous replies are all good suggestions to help you logically 
solve the task.
If you want to avoid the timeout, put a "set_time_limit (0);" at the top 
of the script.
I try to run all these processing type scripts under the command line 
interface because some browsers, I believe, will timeout after a set 
period anyway.

IMO registration forms should only use POST beacuse REQUEST is a
conglomerate of POST, GET, etc and is affected by the php.ini with the
variables_order and  can be  messed up and set insecurely by the host;
having said that, i do believe that cURL can do a POST. so it's not a 100%
solution to the problem.

Having said all of that -- make sure all of your forum software is up to
date with the latest patches, etc; they release those for a reason, and it's
not because they are bored.

Can you specify which forums you are having problems with?  A name might
help with other solutions and suggestions.

if it has only started happening with the latest version i would check the
vBulletin forums and see if there is a fix for the bug, or to even make sure
they know about it.

In response to the fellow having problems with forum spammer, google "Bad Behavior" and install it. 

Other ideas. 

Create a question where people have answer for example "5+2". Or forego that because it's a pain and simply add a form field that you use css to hide from humans and if that field gets filled out, then you know it's a bot and you don't let them in. Or alternatively, if they fail that test, you can pop up a captcha. You can also add some javascript which scrapers tend not to scrape, so if the javascript wasn't pulled with the page, you know it's likely a bot. 

Also add a referer requirement. Make sure the previous page to form submission came from one of your domains. If it didn't, it's likely a scammer.

Hope this helps.

The tools to defeat captchas are getting better and easier to use.
What is the registration process?  If it is passing a captcha and
confirming an email address, then you may be getting brute forced.
Are your forum links "no follow"?  If not, you could try taking the
incentive to spam away.

Through SQL injection, the bad guys need not approach through the front-door 
registration process.  Perhaps some query on a random page somewhere is 
being hijacked: Get the stupid widget from the stupid table, and oh, by the 
way, insert this new user into the registered members table.

I'm not familiar with vBulletin but if you can grep through ALL the queries 
being executed on your site, and search for the new badguy usernames that 
are being injected into your table, then you can find which query is being 
used to add them.  It need not be anywhere on the registration page.

Yeah, this is a "really hard" problem, on the order of stopping spam
from coming into your inbox.

For most sites, on most days, you can get by with a few of the hacks
suggested above. Your goal is really to make your site just different
enough that the spammers will have to rewrite their script in order to
spam you. Most will simply move on rather than do that.

But since we're developers here, we kind of need to think long-term
about the problem. The more 5+2 solutions and tarpit hidden fields
that spammers encounter over time, the smarter their scripts are going
to get. It's a classic arms race.

If I was going to write any sort of comments framework today (and that
includes web forms, or anything else that solicits input from the
anonymous web) I would design it so that everything went through a
spam filter first, and the bigger the better. Like GMail if you can
accept that from a privacy point of view, or your organization's
internal spam filter. Then, and only then, would I allow the filtered
comments/responses back into the web system.

The downside is a huge increase in complexity, and a potential lack of
transparency (false positives are a problem, and how do you train the
system?). But comment spam IS spam, they are the same problem.
Actually a little worse, because it's much easier to find comments
forms on the web than it is to find working email addresses.

Just looked at Bad Behavior, and it looks like an excellent tool to
add to the kit.

But really, how primitive are your spamming bots if they can't deliver
a plausible set of HTTP headers?

Akismet should be mentioned here, a popular spam detection ASP, free for 
non-commercial use
http://akismet.com/

Have used it in a couple sites, easy to use API and it has a really good 
effect. False positives about 2% of the time - but you can usually see why 
it "thought" they were spam....  The admin backend has a comment log where 
moderator can manually approve where needed, similar to wordpress. 

enjoy,
Sam

hey. that looks interesting too. But it sounds 

http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/documentation/how-it-works/

like it is just looking at HTTP headers? if you are running Apache is maybe 
better handled by mod_security

http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2003/11/26/mod_security.html

which does that and a whole lot more, with less overhead because it never gets 
to the request processing phase. If you are a hosting provider and have 
untrusted web apps running on it, it has to be recommended. It will deny not 
only spam bots but most w0rms and brute force attacks (false positives being 
a problem here as well though)

OTOH if you don't have root, then BB would be a good line of defense.

most of them are very stupid and have "Perl/LWP" in the User-Agent header for 
instance. They are no more advanced than they have to be.

Another new entry is Mollum (www.mollum.com).  It was created by the 
lead developer of Drupal, Dries Buytaert.  It bundles up concepts from 
Akismet, Captcha, Razor and SpamAssassin (Baysian filtering) into a 
pretty effective anti-spam package.

I use it on BrooklynRowHouse.com.  It only generates a Captcha (visual 
and aural) when it's unsure.

  INTRODUCTION:
  -------------

  The Asterisk web site says: Asterisk is the world's leading open
  source telephony engine and tool kit.  This month, our speaker
  will give us a hands-on demonstration of setting up a free PBX
  (Phone System) and IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system,
  using VoIP (Voice over IP) phones and a VoIP provider (Internet
  Phone Service).

  Previously (back in the year 2000), Unigroup had presented
  the "Bayonne" Open Source Telephony Project.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  MAIN PRESENTATION
  -----------------

  Topic: The Asterisk Open Source PBX/Telephony System:
         From The Ground Up!

  We'll compile the code and start up the asterisk server.  Then
  hook up a couple of phones so we can make an internal PBX call.
  From there, we'll register with a VoIP provider and make
  a real call to someone in the audience.  Last, we can also build
  a basic voice response system to make a virtual "haunted house"
  for this coming October 31st.

  Outline for the Talk:

   - About The Asterisk Project
   - Getting the code and compiling it
   - Basic configuration
   - Setting up phone extensions
   - Registering a SIP phone
   - Making an internal call
   - Registering with a VoIP service
   - Calling an outside line, receiving a call from an outside line
   - Basic call routing and IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
   - (Helping people get a system up and running on their laptops)

  Speaker Biography:
  ------------------

  Paul Charles Leddy has been a Linux Systems Administrator for about
  10 years.  The story of how he got involved with computer telephony
  is: "Dreaming of voice over the Internet since circa '96, when
  Paul heard about Mark Spencer's Asterisk, he just had to get it up
  and running.  He downloaded the code onto his Mac laptop and had a
  dial tone within minutes: Wow!  Since then, he has gone on to
  implement a few phone extensions, Interactive Voice Response
  playhouses, hooked up to a real live VoIP service or two, like
  Junction Networks and VoipJet, and helped friends and family
  discover the wonderful world of cheap talk, walking the walk."

I'm not used to working through lists. Just started. The other one I use they have a reply-to on the individual message so the subject get's appended. How do you guys get the "re" in the subject line?

Anyway, I'm responding to the forum spammer thread. These days, if you put some energy into it, you can reduce spam to just a few a day or less. And using these methods will likely improve your ranking on google and reduce your bandwidth bill, but indeed it's an arms race. Also, I agree Akismet is great btw...

it would appear that your "problems" are arrising from the use of the Digest
volume.

I've been on many a list in my day and the Digest version always breaks a
message thread.

If you continue to use the digest, you would probably be best off to copy
the message that you are replying to into your email *above* your response.

Yeah, digests are bad, unless you are sure you will always be read
only. I wonder if some of the list indexing services like nabble allow
you to write a message to the list.

Message-ID: <48F7A3EB.2080900@tgaconnect.com>

Raf, 

On the phone we talked and I said it would be be helpful
to get the prospectus which Knollwood offers to their
clients. In other words, what they offered the clients.

You said did I mean the something something memorandum
(I think you said the Private Placement Memorandum)

Now if we can get the binding agreement that would be
even better. But what I thought we would go over

Raf, 

On the phone we talked and I said it would be be helpful
to get the prospectus which Knollwood offers to their
clients. In other words, what they offered the clients.

You said did I mean the something something memorandum
(I think you said the Private Placement Memorandum)

Now if we can get the binding agreement that would be
even better. But what I thought we would go over
at the meeting with Dave (the one that Pete couldn't get to) was what
Knollwood has already promised to the end clients  in general  terms.

This article "12 Tricks to Teach Your Thumb Drive" includes info on how

carry a work environment to remote locations. Also, explains a method to
bring a browser with you so you can surf privately and plausibly leave
no tracks at all. 

 

Very occasionally I post a tech article to this list that I believe
could be generally valuable to a PHP programmer.  All very interesting.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] accessibility issue, how to solve?
Message-ID: <427215754.20081017191400@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello NYPHP,

I know I am going to get some heat for this one but here goes...

Let me preface this by definitively stating that I am categorically
NOT making a request for information on how to hack into a system.
This is a legitimate programming problem that I am trying to solve.

I have a situation where a visually impaired user needs to pass his
username and password to a forum via a php script (preferably) for obvious
reasons he can not physically pass the info himself. He is using a text
reader software so once he is logged in to the forum at least he is able to
participate or a least read the contents of the threads.

The Forum Software provider has been pretty proactive in coding
"injection prevention" methods so passing the username and password
via a script may not be possible.

Any accessibility experts got any suggestions on how to solve this
problem.

TIA for any help.

Don't have enough information. The injection countermeasures employed by 
the forum website need to be examined. In the simplest case, a Curl 
request might suffice.  There might be some javascript "challenge" 
computation task or a captcha that would make things more difficult. If 
possible, I think the easier solution would be to have his browser 
"remember" the login and password. :)

thanks for the reply.

That works "after" you have done the first login but if the browser
cache get cleared for what ever reason you still have to pass the
username and password somehow. I agree with the idea but I still have
to get that initial login to be automated.

The forum has a multistep compare of md5(password) + seed with stored
password in the db.

a) make sure MAMP has Apache active/started

b) make sure you have MAMP set to listen to port 80 or if you can't do that
alter your URL to http://localhost:8888/test.php

c) make sure any firewall you have allows connection to localhost on port
8888 or 80 depending on what you do above


I figure the most likely reason is #a or #b

Update: I just discovered that the "robot" that is accessing and
spamming my sites it XRumer. It hacks into gmail, gets a valid gmail
account then it registers and spams as many Forum sites as it can find
to "plant" illicit links so it can exploit google's PR system.

Anyone know of an anti-XRumer script or detector?

I got only one reply to this post. I solved the problem with a simple html
form and a javascript submit so that the blind person that needed the
access just needs to click on an html link if anyone was interested.
The script runs on the local computer and automatically logs them into
their account much like a keystroke capture program would do.

Forum spamming is a typical problem. To stop that, you need to burden 
your users with a captcha upon registration, or if you don't require 
users to register, then burden them with a captcha upon each posting. I 
suppose if you code up your own exotic form submit scheme (maybe through 
javascript/ajax?) the bots may skip scanning your forms and move onto

Subject: [nycphp-talk] RFC -- Lever Voting System
Message-ID: <48FF145D.60001@vassar.edu>


A neighbor sent me a link which I actually opened this morning (usually 
not)  and I was surprised I'd never heard about the backlash against the 
push to move to computerized voting.  I guess in my geeky little world, 
it never occurred to me that people would object so strongly solely on 
the basis of security, I had thought the alienation of voters who were 
not comfortable using technology would be the chief complaint.

What is your take?  -- the link my neighbor sent:

Obviously way OT, but the more I think about this, the more I am
convinced that the Presidential election should be a one-week event,
and that should be the only thing that is voted on. You go in the
booth and push one button. Plain and simple. It gets rid of this early
voting nonsense, along with hanging chads and the like.

I know this is not entirely on topic but I thought I would share this  
with you.

Today at 3PM EST a site that I have been working on over the last few  
months is going to go live.

http://www.politics.com/  - If you are political please come check out  
what has been keeping me busy over the last few months.

There is one minor annoyance for me and I have spoken up about it.

While you are on the site in order to get to the detail page you have  
to click on the part of the article where it says '0 comments' you  
cannot click on the title or body of the article as it will just take  
you to the actual source of the article.

If you also find this to be annoying and unclear please send an email  
to support at politics.com

but this was not my decision :)

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

I think that when you click on the title or the body,
you should go to the article and then in the article
you can/should have a link to the source

That seems sensible to me.  But I'll have to wait and see what it's  
all actually about, really.

If you feel the same as Nestor and I please click the Feedback link in  
the header of the site and submit it there :)

I would love to see that change but I doubt they will without the user  
input.

Sorry it should be unlocked now.

I am not sure what delayed them.  I said 3PM they were supposed to  
have it done at 2:30PM :)

Thanks,

One other minor annoyance, and I don't mean to pick because I have this 
problem with a lot of sites that require double-opt.  But it's something 
that a lot of site developers seem to overlook: ya gotta register that 
outbound STMP server in DNS:

Oct 22 16:08:14 jack postfix/smtpd[93665]: connect from 
unknown[208.91.206.42]
Oct 22 16:08:14 jack postfix/smtpd[93665]: NOQUEUE: reject: CONNECT from 
unknown[208.91.206.42]: 554 5.7.1 Client host rejected: cannot find your 
hostname, [208.91.206.42]; proto=SMTP
Oct 22 16:08:14 jack postfix/smtpd[93665]: disconnect from 
unknown[208.91.206.42]

Mail servers like mine that do reverse DNS lookups to prevent spamming 
will reject inbound mail from unknown hosts.

Michael,

Unfortunately no it is not ZF, it is a custom framework that my  
employer has developed and uses for all their sites.

Thanks,

I think it is a very solid effort, well done. On a great domain of course.

Only thing that might confuse a user, is the different behavior on the
article links.

You have to click on the "x comments" in order to stay in politics.com,
every other link send to the actual story.

I believe it needs a little clarification. It works like digg but even
digg.com can seem peculiar to a first visitor.

Petros,

That is the annoyance I was talking about.  Could you please click the  
feedback link in the header and send that to the PM :)

They won't change it unless they get user feedback that it needs to  
change.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

Fair Use only permits limited quotation of a copyrighted work.  This 
summer AP went nuts when it floated a new policy requiring a license to

I see the need to have a link to original story. It would be unfair to
completely reproduce the text (even with a link mentioning the source).
My note was actual on the implementation of this. It would seem more logical
to have a "visit mentioned article" and a  "comment on the article" or
something similar. My English is not that good unfortunately.

Joseph I am using the feedback right now...

are configured to go there.

You will only se databases your MySQL username is allowed to see.

Maybe you used "root" in the query browser but not in phpMyAdmin?

You folks have done this a thousand times so it's cake to you. This is the
first time I have had to make a Powerpoint download available only to
authenticated users. Tell me if it's this simple:

<?php
/* download.php pr something like that */

// authentication logic. Then, if they're logged in...

header('Content-disposition: attachment; filename=whatever.ppt');
header('Content-type: application/vnd.ms-powerpoint');
readfile('whatever.ppt');

And yes, I think I will put an apache directive in there to deny direct
browser access so they can't defeat it by accessing
http://example.org/password-protected-area/whatever.ppt. Or maybe put it
somewhere outside the public html.

Is that it, or am I missing anything?

Yeah don't keep the powerpoint in the htdocs directory.  Your
methodology is sound. Of course, if this is the only thing password
protected, just protect that directory with a htpasswd and htaccess
file.

It's also straight forward to hide the location o the original file by
using fopen, fread.

// authentication logic, then...

$fileName = 'whatever.ppt';
$filePath = 'folder/' $fileName;

header('Content-Disposition: atachment; filename="' . $fileName . '"');
header("Content-Type: application/ppt"); // <-- not sure this is right
header("Content-Length: " . filesize($filePath));
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Expires: 0");
$fp=fopen("$filePath","r");
print fread($fp, filesize("$filePath"));
fclose($fp);

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Sun/MySQL/PHP Special Presentation - YOU PICK
Message-ID: <000901c939e2$51b8afa0$f52a0ee0$@com>

All,

We're pleased to host two of Sun/MySQL premier technical team members for a
NYPHP Special Presentation, November 12th.  We'll put the announcement out
this week, but first you need to pick which presentation should be given -
these are technical/overview presentations.

These are the options (some have descriptions for greater clarity) - a
simple plus one for ONE presentation that you'd like is all that's needed.

Please provide feedback ASAP so that we can schedule things correctly.


-- Writing Tag systems in PHP/MySQL, that scale to memcached, with XDebug
for Profiling;  Writing a social application such as forums, messaging or
guilds with PHP/MySQL and what happens when a million people show up on
opening day.

-- MySQL 5.1 features

-- Using MySQL partitions in practice

-- MySQL Proxy wizardry

-- Testing with MySQL Sandbox
MySQL Sandbox is a tool that can install a side instance of MySQL in a few
seconds, efficiently, precisely, and without influencing existing
installations. Testing new versions can be tedious and error prone. Using
MySQL Sandbox, the process of testing single servers or replication systems
can be greatly simplified.

-- MySQL Community How To
A sort of movie of the ways a community member can participate to the MySQL
project, with a step-by-step illustration of what is available and how to
use it, from getting help with forums to contributing code, passing through
events, reporting bugs, publishing projects.

-- Creative cross-language programming with MySQL
Although MySQL is sometimes perceived as a minimalist DBMS, it has a huge
potential for creative hacks. The Federated and Blackhole engine, MySQL
Proxy, user variables, and some other hooks allow the imaginative developer
to achieve impressive results independently from the client's programming
language.

-- Advanced Lua programming for MySQL Proxy
Having learned the basic of Lua programming for Proxy, some advanced topics
can be covered.  This session will explain how to tackle some difficult
tasks with the Proxy, organizing your work so that you can create a new
script in minutes:
 -- using a script loader to change script at run time, without restarting;
 -- creating new commands
 -- creating quick methods for returning datasets and error messages to the
client;
 -- Executing multiple commands in the Proxy, while returning only one
result to the client
 -- chaining more scripts to extend Proxy feature

Word/etc always manages to create new and exciting chars, but the following
usually take care of most of them.

$this->Value = str_replace(array(chr(0x92),chr(0x93),
chr(0x94),chr(0x96),chr(0x97),chr(0x85)),
array('\'','"','"','-','-','...'),$this->Value);

That's for sure.

Here's what I use, there's probably a more elegant/readable way to do it.

// convert smart quotes and mdashes
$wordchars=array('?','"','"',''',''',"?");
$fixedchars=array('&mdash;','&quot;','&quot;',"'","'","&hellip;");
$output = str_replace( $wordchars, $fixedchars, $output );

I'm not sure why but neither suggestion seemed to work, here is what I  
found that does work

/**
  * Remove unwanted MS Word high characters from a string
  *
  * @param string $string
  * @return string $string
  */
function sanitizeString($string = null)
{
	if(is_null($string)) return false;
	
	//-> Replace all of those weird MS Word quotes and other high  
characters
     $badwordchars=array(
         "\xe2\x80\x98", // left single quote
         "\xe2\x80\x99", // right single quote
         "\xe2\x80\x9c", // left double quote
         "\xe2\x80\x9d", // right double quote
         "\xe2\x80\x94", // em dash
         "\xe2\x80\xa6" // elipses
     );
     $fixedwordchars=array(
         "'",
         "'",
         '"',
         '"',
         '&mdash;',
         '...'
     );
     return htmlspecialchars(str_replace($badwordchars,$fixedwordchars, 
$string));
}

I've ran into strange and subtle issues when actually putting the chars to replace themselves into code.  This is especially frustrating with encoding/etc of various files, in which cases sometimes these won't match correctly.  Thus, the chr(0x96) usage, which is more explicit.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OpenID is what?
Message-ID: <65161666.20081030101506@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello NYPHP,

Having been recently hacked and several of my webmaster email account
names being hijacked by spammers, I am looking for viable solutions to
safeguard my websites and the membership of these sites.

I just ran across some discussion about openID (yes, I have been in a
cave now for some time, lol) and am skeptical that the primary motivation
is altruistic like when g$$gle first came on the scene, it too "looked like"
a good thing for the planet but evolved into the world's biggest $$$ machine
that is likely, if not already, to make micro$ look like chump change.

I sense rather that OpenID is yet another marketing ploy to rake in
huge piles of cash rather than provide warmth and security that it
touts in its hype. Already, I see lots of RED FLAGS about being highly
susceptible to phishing, like what isn't these days.

All of my websites run php forum and CMS software of varying flavors
so I am not convinced that OpenID is a viable solution to secure them
against the kinds of attacks I have see recently and wonder about the
integrity of a system that claims (from phpMyID):

    * The whole point of OpenID is to allow you to manage your own identity, and phpMyID lets you do that without giving control to a third party.
    * It's easy to install and easy to configure. Edit just a few lines in your config file, and you're off and running!
    * Allows "Smart Mode OpenID" (more secure) transactions, even if you don't have a "big math" library available. Seriously, phpMyID comes with a pure-PHP math library which can be used if you want to demand that extra level of security.
    * Ensures secure password transmission even if you don't have SSL! By using HTTP Digest authentication, phpMyID ensures your password is never sent or stored anywhere in clear or decypherable text.

I would really appreciate an eye opener on this one. It looks like
more flim flam to me.

I would add to this the following:
chr(0x91) -> '&#8217;' [backtick]
chr(0xa0) -> ' ' [space]

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XSL with RSS 2.0
Message-ID: <C745E06B-88A2-4720-AD44-67F64B4ECB25@gmail.com>

Guys I am having a bit of a problem here.

I have an RSS 2.0 Feed that I am trying to style up with XSL and it is  
not working properly.  It seems that it is not picking up the XSL  
document that I have created.
I finally figured out the problem that was keeping it from picking up  
the XSL document and that is when I put the
<rss version="2.0">
tag into my RSS it set's the mime type to application/xml+xhtml and  
that is what throws things off.

What I need to know is if there is a way to make XSL work while still  
including the <rss> tag.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

OpenID is a means of authentication using a trusted third party. Its
main benefit is to make it easy for users to register for and consume
services at many different sites, without having to use different
passwords at each one. A secondary benefit is that users don't need to
trust the authentication mechanisms of each site they log into, they
only need to trust their OpenID provider.

OpenID is not going to do much of anything to make your sites more
secure, unless your accounts were hijacked because the authentication
process was inherently insecure (it took place over http, or passwords
were stored as plain text, or it is easy to brute-force the login
script).

OpenID doesn't do anything about cross-site-scripting, sql injection,
insecure file uploads, or any of the 999 other ways that clever bad
guys attack poorly written webapps.

Hello Mike,

I think you have your real question here:

Having been recently hacked and several of my webmaster email account
names being hijacked by spammers, I am looking for viable solutions to
safeguard my websites and the membership of these sites.

How about fixing the problem, instead of adding new security measures? 
Please define "hacked"?

Did they guess the passwords to theses accounts - Enforce 
non-standard/dictionary passwords, implement password expiration policies.
Did they brute force an account - lock the account after N failed 
attempts in Y minutes (example: 15 failed logins in 1 minute).
Did they sniff traffic - Require all credentials (and maybe everything) 
be sent over SSL.
Did they sql inject - Bind your params & validate all user input.
Don't let someone send out >N emails in Y minutes (example: 50 emails in 
1 minute) - If you control the front end to the mail, you could add some 
last line of
defense checks into that.

- Ben

Hacked meaning that they, the badguys managed to ftp a folder full of
porn to one of my subdirectories and its still a mystery how they did
that exactly. The ISP claims they took advantage of an exploit in the
php code but has no data to support that claim thus far. So, I can't
say that the site authorization was compromised with any certainty.

Sorry, didn't mean to downplay the seriousness of this hack, the
badguys were server 10s or thousands of porn images for several days
before the site ran out of bandwidth and shut down. That was the only
way I discovered that they were there. I had not idea that my site was
being used to distribute the junk before the bandwidth limit killed
the site. Even now, I am getting thousands of requests per hour for the
junk stuff that has been gone for a week.

You should redirect all those requests to google adword pages. :)

How did you figure out that they did it over FTP?  FTP is a pointless
protocol these days... turn it off.

Are you on a shared host?

+1 to this. Prevention is better than cure.

To me, this seems manipulation of URL/s on your website that has file 
uploading feature.

That was essentially what the assumption was by the ISP, they think
that the hacker got in using one of the folders that is required to be
"writable" by the script for stuff like image processing and they
speculated that having gotten in, they simply uploaded their junk to
an obscure folder that contained a single php file. My problem with
that theory is that they can not produce the hack that let them into
the system, like I would normally see something like this in my
logifles - /inc/design.inc.php?dir[inc]=http://www.etc

Hackers try to use this technique on some of my site all the time but
I have plugged that hole and have the script send me an email when
they attempt to piggyback the url. I didn't get one for the hack that
got executed to load the porn onto my site so its still a matter of
speculation about how it actually got accomplished. No new exploits
have been reported against this software either for that matter. I am
reasonably certain that my site isn't the only one that has been
hijacked by porno peddlers but I can only find references to my site
when I do searches for keywords the badguys are using.

I do think it might have been a URL manipulation in spite of the fact
that I don't have a log entry to confirm it.

thanks for the reply.

So the directory is writable by the script... what user does the script run as?

Are there other accounts on the server that can also execute scripts
as that user? If so, the access would be in their logs, not yours.
