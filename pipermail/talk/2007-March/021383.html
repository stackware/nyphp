    One answer is to always use a new virtual host to deploy a new 
instance of a system.  It's easy to do this with Apache.  At my last 
job,  I developed a system for packaging an entire virtual host in a 
single directory -- each directory would have a &quot;conf&quot;,  &quot;htdocs&quot; and 
&quot;logs&quot; directory.  We'd add &quot;lib&quot;,  &quot;var&quot;,  &quot;scripts&quot; and similar 
directories if they were appropriate.  The httpd.conf file would include 
a &quot;vhosts.conf&quot; file that simply includes the virtual host configuration 
files from the vhost directories.  The vhost directories go in a 
structure like

/usr/local/apache/sites/www.site.com

    In this scheme,  most web sites have three &quot;primary&quot; configuration 
parameters.  These are:  (1) the virtual hostname,  (2) the location of 
the &quot;sites&quot; directory,  and (3) connection information for the 
database.  A site built to this scheme can often be moved or cloned in 
under five minutes.

    If you work this way,  a good practice with URLs is to base them all 
&quot;relative to the virtual host&quot;,  which means like

/img/logo.gif
/css/main.css

    this way you know that every resource on the site can reference 
every other access without recomputing URLs.

    Another good practice is to use the &quot;root&quot; directory sparingly.  
It's OK to have

/robots.txt
/favicon.ico

    and other filenames that are mandated by outside conventions,  but 
install a CMS in it's own directory,  say

/a/

    where you let your CMS do whatever it wants.  The reason is that you 
might switch to another CMS in a few years,  which you can
install under

/b/

    When you decomission CMS A,  you build something (URL rewriting 
rules,  a script,  whatever) that redirects /a/ -&gt; /b/ as accurately as 
possible.

----

    Unfortunately,  not everybody can use the above scheme.  It's not as 
easy to pull off with Microsoft IIS,  and some people don't have good 
control of their DNS.  Also,  general-purpose software (say PHPBB or 
Wordpress) will be installed in subdirectories by people,  so it needs 
to be able to live &quot;whereever&quot;  (using &lt;base href&gt; can help,  but opens 
it's own bunch of problem.)  No matter what,  software should configure 
the toplevel URL and the toplevel of the app in the filesystem in a 
single place,  in a file that's unique to each instance of the app 
(often the one file ~NOT~ in the version control system)
