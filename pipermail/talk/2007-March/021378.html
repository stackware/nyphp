I'd just start from scratch and use the new web based system for new 
stuff and the old system for legacy stuff. There is a transition time 
while two systems are in use, which sucks big time, but it depends on 
how quickly records gets obsoleted overall.
Starting from scratch allows you to do things differently that do not 
work that great in the current system (believe me, there are things like 
that in every system). Since CRM data is usually the most interesting, 
I'd see that you isolate that information and device a one time import 
plan, e.g. via csv and some one time use code that sucks that all into 
the MySQL database (if code is even needed). Doesn't SQL server export 
SQL directly?
My point is to foremost forget about the old system and make a new shiny 
one. Then see on how to get old data ported over, ideally the least 
amount with which you can get away with.

Just the 2&#8364; from someone who never did anything like this....
