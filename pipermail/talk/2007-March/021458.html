</I>&gt;<i> Yes, technically correct -- it is the webserver. BUT, to the

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>John:

You are correct in saying that the URL defines the resource, and the 
&quot;permanence&quot; (I use that loosely) is quite important really.  The way I 
translated the question was more or less along the lines of, &quot;say I have 
this resource, which looks like a folder, is it going to look for an 
index.html file?&quot;

In the case of my answer, no.  The search engines are not going to try 
to guess the default resource to go to in the event of something that 
appears to be a folder.  They merely go where they're told, and they 
follow (usually) a number of rules along the way.

Now then, as I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong, John... as 
I'm actually curious), if you move a resource to a new location, you 
should provide the proper headers to do so (I believe 302 for 
permanently moved, but I don't use it enough to know off the top of my 
head), than most intelligent search engines are aware of the change.  
Moving resources should be fairly painless, in that regard.

As far as AJAX is concerned, that's a touchy subject with me.  I try to 
make sure that anything I'm serving via AJAX is more-or-less personal to 
the person requesting it, say a message list or friends list or 
something, directly related to the person.  There's always elegant 
fallbacks, and what I tend to use AJAX for (I am using AJAX as a synonym 
of a XMLHttpRequest object, as opposed to anything else which would be 
correct) is personal data related to the user currently logged in that 
isn't important to be indexed.


I intended to write a bit more, I have to deal with some other issues I 
wasn't expecting so I'll leave it at that :(
