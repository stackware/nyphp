a small bench, anyway I agree, a good designed DB is more important,
also performance thanks to the edge caching (squid, varnish ...) and
browser caching are no more a critical issue

If you have to change framework for your new projects keep also in
consideration Ruby, clean and awesome!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My mantra... (a.k.a. rant)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't use software that tries to solve all problems. The worst
</I>&gt;<i> software grows out of goal-less development. Look for something with
</I>&gt;<i> clear, concise, decisive design decisions. The *nix moto... do one
</I>&gt;<i> thing and do it right. LESS CODE IS BETTER! A good example that will
</I>&gt;<i> hit close to home for some and I hope won't start a flame war is
</I>&gt;<i> Drupal. Until recently it was a bloated mess. It has started to clean
</I>&gt;<i> up it's act come version 7 but in my opinion it still does WAY too
</I>&gt;<i> much for it's own good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't use software if the documentation is not up to snuff. Don't
</I>&gt;<i> take api/(insert language here)doc as enough. When you are getting up
</I>&gt;<i> to speed in a new technology you need much more handholding or face
</I>&gt;<i> hair loss. You need cookbooks, working examples, CURRENT api and
</I>&gt;<i> method signatures. etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont use software if it hasn't already been put into production some
</I>&gt;<i> very visible places. Use something you know works. Why be the first on
</I>&gt;<i> the block to see if X scales? You know how I know what scales. I have
</I>&gt;<i> seen larger stacks use it in the past. Safe bets are best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont use software if it hasn't had at least 2 minor releases. Unless
</I>&gt;<i> you need a specific feature of a bleeding edge release just use what
</I>&gt;<i> you know will work! How do you know... because it's been around for a
</I>&gt;<i> while and people have used it and tested it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont use software if it has no community involvement. (Don't
</I>&gt;<i> underestimate other peoples schedules... think about how busy you get
</I>&gt;<i> during your average work year. You may just have a project dropped
</I>&gt;<i> from under you. One core developer on an open source project is not
</I>&gt;<i> enough to bet the house on.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer my software to come with unit/functional tests. If nothing
</I>&gt;<i> else they can be used as examples. But the piece of mind you get as a
</I>&gt;<i> developer if you know what you are using has been tested thoroughly is
</I>&gt;<i> worth more than the most amazing untested functionality you can dream
</I>&gt;<i> of. Just think of all the times you banged your head on your desk
</I>&gt;<i> trying to figure out why something isn't doing what the documentation
</I>&gt;<i> said it was supposed to do. Only to find out yes... it is a bug in the
</I>&gt;<i> library you are using!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hate using software. Less is better period. If you can get away
</I>&gt;<i> without using an extra daemon then do it. Don't add 5 more caching
</I>&gt;<i> layers and 3 more database abstractions just because they are the new
</I>&gt;<i> cool acronyms. It's only going to make your code less maintainable.
</I>&gt;<i> Over architecting and early optimization are what keep projects from
</I>&gt;<i> ever getting to launch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same thing goes for languages. Don't write your services in more
</I>&gt;<i> than 1 language if you can avoid it. If you are writing webapps from
</I>&gt;<i> the ground up limit yourself to one backend and one frontend language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't add caching until you need it! The same thing goes for sharding
</I>&gt;<i> of your database schemas! KISS... across your entire stack. Not just
</I>&gt;<i> your code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whew... sorry about that. Back to the topic at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Symfony 1.X is probably still more widely used than Symfony 2.x and
</I>&gt;<i> both are good. Although 2.x is a far more abstracted and multipurpose
</I>&gt;<i> framework 1.x is still great for the usual 3 tier webapps. Both are
</I>&gt;<i> very well documented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CodeIgniter is a really great lightweight framework. If you are
</I>&gt;<i> looking for something straight forward, well documented and full of
</I>&gt;<i> examples this is also a good choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zend had so much steam early on and then where did it go? I feel like
</I>&gt;<i> they have been sleeping.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yii has been around for a while and same with Kohana but both have
</I>&gt;<i> less numbers than the above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to revisit cake. I haven't used it in a while but for a while
</I>&gt;<i> it was seriously suffering on the documentation front.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I was to pick a framework to run with on a new project I would
</I>&gt;<i> probably pick Symfony 2 because of it's forward thinking architecture.
</I>&gt;<i> It can seem overly complex so be warned. If you haven't already heard
</I>&gt;<i> of things like dependency injection or service containers you may feel
</I>&gt;<i> a little lost. The good thing is that there is a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> documentation to get you up to speed. Also it makes use of useful
</I>&gt;<i> things like ESI and... HTTP... who knew!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Jesse
