This is my pain with trying to learn symfony2 this week. I'm trying some 
stuff out, and just find myself repeatedly coming to a point and 
thinking, &quot;okay, now what the heck am I supposed to do to achieve X?&quot; 
Not so symfony1... not sure if it has better documentation or just b/c 
of the years of experience I have with it, but symfony1 seemed much more 
transparent, in a good way. The vertical Askeet/Jobeet tutorials were of 
course a big help. Actually I remember that the major changes for 1.2 
threw me off, but nothing as bad as this.

My main problem is divesting myself of the assumptions of the framework. 
Kohana was perfect for this; I had a weird, weird backend from a Perl 
application, for which I crafted a Kohana front-end; it was perfectly 
flexible, and the 2.3-something documentation was at least adequate.

Then their community welched on the 2.4 release they'd been promising, 
and lost my trust. :(  Goes to show how important community is, to me 
anyway.

Haven't looked at CI in years, maybe time for a revisit. The whole 
let's-hug-PHP4 thing they had going at the time was a huge turnoff for me.
