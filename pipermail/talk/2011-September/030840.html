<PRE>A lean &amp; mean AJAX-specific framework is SlimPHP.  I've used it and can 
say that I was happy with it.

The &quot;big 5&quot; are clearly:  CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Drupal, Zend &amp; Symfony.  
Maybe some agencies in NYC are using Yii but in all my years I've never 
run into one.

I think that it's a good idea to get experience using as many different 
frameworks as you can so you become comfortable with MVC architectures 
in general, and know what the plusses/minuses are in different 
situations.  In many cases the people doing the hiring are narrow 
thinkers who only want to hire someone with experience in &quot;that specific 
framework&quot; when the truth is, after a few years, they all start to seem 
pretty similar.

It's best to stick whenever possible with the less bloated options, like 
Kohana, where performance issues are the primary consideration; although 
yes, there is little or no documentation available for Kohana.  In fact 
I will be using Kohana for an upcoming project due to its leanness.

I've dealt extensively with reengineering really horribly designed 
CakePHP codebases and it's amazing what I've seen.  It was clearly 
advertised as a quick, easy way to hire really green programmers to 
build &quot;complex&quot; websites.  It's not.

The framework choice is always less important than having a 
well-designed database underlying your code.

Happy coding,

Kristina

You don't have to list why, just an order from most popular, i.e. there is more demand for developers with experience using the framework. The reason I ask, is I have just spent a year working with CakePhp, which has it's benefits, but I have also seem some flaws with it. So when I'm ready to move on, I would like to go in the direction of flow in the industry.
