David:

In addition to all that was said about other Languages/Customs having access to the Internet in their own native Languages, let me add there ARE symbols in the English Language. We commonly use math symbols, dingbat characters, grammar, and other such symbols in our English language, right? 

In addition, these symbols are on your keyboard, or can be accessed by your keyboard. Just because the Windows environment makes it hard to type a BULLET for example, (ALT 0149), it is really a simple thing to do on a Macintosh -- it's just option 8 -- one character. The world no longer revolves around M$.

As such, in the Safari Browser I can type an option 8 in the address bar and go directly to: <A HREF="http://xn--nvg.com">http://xn--nvg.com</A> the URL will show &#8226;.com.

Another example, if a Macintosh user types option v into the Safari Browser address bar they will go to &#8730;.com (square-root dot com), namely <A HREF="http://xn--nvg.com.">http://xn--nvg.com.</A> Incidentally, that site receives over 200 unique Mac users per day and that rate is rising.

So, your questions as to &quot;who wants such an URL for business anyway?&quot;, let me reply if your customers could remember your site by simply typing a single character into their address bar, would that sound like a good thing to you? Especially if you were selling a Mac product? 

Keep in mind that while single character domains are not available, it has been speculated that they would run into the millions of dollars for each if they were. So, what's the value of a single character domain? In that regard, this makes a good read:

<A HREF="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/28/tech/main1080245.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/28/tech/main1080245.shtml</A>

In addition, these domains can be combined with other domains so that IF the user was on a Windows machine, they would go to one site and if they were on a Safari browser they could go to the url that would show the domain as a symbol. It is simply a redirect and a marketing consideration.

In any event, considering I've been developing software for Apple computers for over three decades now, I'm considering using option v (square-root) OR option 8 (BULLET) as a site to sell my software.

I think it's a neat idea, but I've failed before.  :-)

Cheers,

tedd
