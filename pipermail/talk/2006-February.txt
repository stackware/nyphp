Isn't there a limit to the number of files that can reside in one
directory? If so, then how do you handle managing what is mapped
where?

If I was going to organise a camera watch like the one we are discussing I
would certainly go for the filesystem storage of the pictures, keeping the
pointers on a database.
To circumvent filesystem limitations, if any because we are surely talking
about 640x480x72dpi pics taken every 10 seconds or so, and also to allow me
to do quick filesystem searches for an event, in case of a never expected
but always possible application failure, I would organize my folders in a
cascade like /year/month/day/hour/ kind of thingh, so it would always be
intuitive for both me and my successors, and easy to tar the folders and
send them to the PD, if ever necessary, hehe.

The camera snapshots are 352x240 @ 96 dpi, averaging about 12,288 bytes on
disk. (This server is a <gasp> windows file system)

So after reading and doing some thinking, and taking into account everyones
thoughts, I think I will go with a file system solution. My cameras table
will have a "ftp folder" and a "storage folder" so that you can traverse the
ftp folder for images, if found, index them and move them to the storage
folder, with a little bit more. I que up file videopos20060130101253.jpg and
know the date and time by the filename, so thats how I will get my
timestamp. When I move it, i will move it into the
$ftpfolder/$year/$month/$day/ folder. I have had this recording files for
about 2 weeks, and have already seen 25-30k images, and had to manually
start splitting them up before I had this front-end app up and running :P

The cameras take their snapshots after motion detection on zones that I set,
and after they are triggered they snapshot every second until it detects no
motion on those zones. -So Far- there are 13 cameras, and we would need
another 30 or so to cover all of our Dorm building enterances (I work at a
college).

The thing for viewing is that you have to authenticate vs windows active
directory (through a ldap script I wrote), and be a member of a certain
usergroup. I will have a showimage.php or something like that authenticate,
and if authenticated, read the file from the filesystem and push out the
image, and if not, I guess I have to make a "You are not authorized to view
this mage" picture to view :)

I will also have to figure out some sort of data removal scheme, as the file
storage is limited, so I have to flush out the old as needed, but thats more
of what the security people want me to do, as some cameras can be purged
more often than others.. Though so far we have 214,778 snapshots recorded
(2,797,568,000 bytes on disk), which is 12 days for 13 cameras, so thats
average 17-18 megs a day per camera, which is a lot better for full motion
video :P

Well I have some work ahead of me, but this stuff is great, since PHP has
been my hobby/"on the side" work, and I one again get to use it towards my
job :)

And in central new york, we finally have snow again, enough with this rain
:p

To the more knowledgeable SQL heads in the house:

Do you think it's reliable to mod() the record id to pull every other
record, like:

select * from table where mod(id,2)=0 #or
select * from table where mod(id,2)=1

Or do you think it would be more reliable to manually pull 'em, like:

select * from table limit 1,1
select * from table limit 3,1
etc.

mod() appears to work, but it also seems to behave a lil wonky.

Off the top of my head, I can think of a scenario where this will not work.
If you have a table with an auto-generated ID, where you have ever deleted a
record, in my experience with MySQL, the deleted ID won't get reused, and so
your ID values will be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, etc...  Therefore, that first line
will grab records with IDs 1, 3, 6, 8, etc...  I would probably write
something in PHP to grab *all* the records, and then play with every other
one.

I was thinking the same thing, pulling the entire result and dicarding 
every other row will probably be a lot faster than pulling every other 
row individually.

If you're using the native mysql functions you may be able to traverse 
the record set using mysql_data_seek function to make it a little more 
efficient.

It seems to me that it would be more efficient and 'correct' to query all
rows and output every other record in your php.  Considering that if a row
is removed, the break in your id's will make for an incorrect alternate
output and the mass list of selects seems rather inefficient.  Also ,that
would allow you to modify your query for other needs (orders, grouping, etc)
while still maintaining the alternate output.

(My apologies as I realize this doesn't answer your question, specifically)

Is that not still every other record?  (I don't particularly need every even
or odd record id, just every other entry.)

I don't particularly mind performing logic on the recordset after the fact,
but I would rather put the processing weight on the SQL side (more out of
principle than anything else).

Neither one of those *really* selects every other record...they select 
even or odds IDs.  Subtle difference, but a significant difference.

In response to some others: just because ID 4 is missing [for example] 
doesn't mean ID 5 will have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2...he'll 
still get only even IDs with this:

select * from table where mod(id,2)=0

And odd IDs with this:

select * from table where mod(id,2)=1

Gotcha, that does make a diff. and helps evaluate the app.  Thanks!

If some ids have been removed, you can use a subquery to get the row
number.

For example, if you have a table "your_table" with primary key
"your_table_id", this query will list they key and the row # for this
entry.

select (select SUM(1) from your_table where your_table_id
<=tableAlias.your_table_id) as RowNumber,  your_table_id from your_table_id
tableAlias;

add a "having mod(RowNumber,2) =0" to list every other row.

You're right, my bad.  But it will still return the records with IDs 2, 6,
8, 10, etc., which is not every other record.  (That would be 2, 5, 7, 9,
etc.)

I'm not trying to suggest that solving this problem by getting every record
and letting PHP select every other one is more efficient; I'm merely
suggesting that it's more correct.  :)

I see many people have provided a number good of answers, so let me
step back and ask: "What problem are you trying to solve?"

Why do you need every other row? Is this data likely to change? How
often is it updated? Can you pre-compute an ENUM that you insert upon
writing the table that lets you do:

SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE filter = 'even';
SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE filter = 'odd';

That avoids the computation on each call and avoids the issue with
holes in your id sequences.

Or can you shove things in different tables and when you need both
join them up?

I agree with you here, something seems clunky about getting a large result 
set out of the database, then filtering afterwards in the code.   It would 
seem to waste a lot of bandwidth particularly if the database is on a 
different machine.

Hello Guys,

I am trying to parse a soap response, but i am having no luck with simpleXML

the response is this

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><soap:Envelope xmlns:soap='
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:xsi='
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:xsd='

bGlja2V0eXNoaXA6MTg5ODA3MWQ=</n:Result></n:getTokenResponse></soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

altered a bit ofcourse however when i use SimpleXML like so

$xml = simplexml_load_string($this->response);

i get

 SimpleXMLElement Object
(
    [Body] => SimpleXMLElement Object
        (
            [getTokenResponse] => SimpleXMLElement Object
                (
                    [Result] => bGlja2V0eXNoaXA6MTg5ODA3MWQ=
                )

        )

)

But i cannot seem to get the value for Result no matter what i try
i have tried print_r($xml->children()) nothing is output
i have tried $xml->Body->getTokenResponse->Result nada
i have tried $xml->Body[0]->getTokenResponse->Result
etc.. all the way down to where all 3 are [0]

If anyone has any idea how i can retrieve that value i would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Welcome to XML Namespaces. :)

$xml->children('http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/')->Body
    ->children('http://www.arcwebservices.com/v2006')->getTokenResponse->Result;

This is why the ext/soap extension is good for parsing SOAP documents.

I don't think you can take a random SOAP message lying around on the
file system or database and pass it to the extension.

However, you can use the extension to query the SOAP server and the
SOAP extension will then deserialize the response into a native-ish
PHP data structure.

That is the primary use-case for SOAP.

I don't think it would be hard to add support for reading input from
other places, but you would have to know how to code PHP extensions.

Adam,

i am using soap to get that xml response, but i was not sure the soap ext
could parse it so i used $sclient->__getLastResponse() in SimpleXML, can you
advise (or direct me to reading) how i would get the data from ext/soap,
without using simpleXML?

Thanks,

Actually, if you look at the ext/soap unit tests in the php source 
distribution, you can see how to do this (in userspace).

$client = new SOAPClient('my.wsdl');
$response = $client->query('param');
$result = $response->Result;

You made me look out of curiosity.  Its nice that it can be "tricked"
but it does seem silly to have binded it to the POST data.  SOAP's
primary transport may be HTTP, but it is intended to be agnostic of
transport.  HTTP, SMTP, message queues, sneaker, fax, pigeon, etc are
valid SOAP transports.  Too bad the extension is specific to HTTP POST.

Just my $0.02, FWIW.

Clever.  Here's a similar and possibly more efficient solution:

    SET @I = 0;
    SELECT ID FROM SomeTable having mod(@I:=@I+1,2) = 0;

Be sure to reset @I after each use or you'll get funky results.

HTH,

If post processing is a large concern and you'd rather figure it out on the
database side, you could try making a stored procedure. Using a cursor would
allow you to loop through every row and use a counter to get every other
row, effectively solving both the problem of holes in your ID numbers and
wanting to do this server side. I guess the most puzzling piece for me is
why you actually need to do this.

Now I haven't actually tested this so it comes with no warranty and probably
doesn't work but here's a quick pseudo stored procedure that might clear it
up for you:

 CREATE PROCEDURE getEveryOther(IN starting_id INT)
     BEGIN
       DECLARE complete      INT DEFAULT 0;
       DECLARE rank       INT DEFAULT 0;
       DECLARE current_id INT;
       DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT foo_id FROM foos WHERE foo_id >=
starting_id LIMIT 10;
       DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '02000' SET complete = 1;

       OPEN cur1;
       WHILE complete = 0 DO
         FETCH cur1 INTO current_id;
           SET rank = rank+1;
           IF MOD(rank, 2) = 1 THEN
          SELECT current_id;
           END IF;
       END WHILE;

       CLOSE cur1;
     END;

Cheers and good luck!

Ah, a wise man.. The problem isn't, what is the answer. As is so often
true, the real problem is what is the question.

hi rahmin,

while you probably got the answer you were looking for somewhere in
this thread, you still haven't answered Adams question, which is
probably the best comment here:

As usual I'm late on the thread, but I was going to ask this very
question myself, so thanks for leading the way, Keith.

A number of the answers here echo this sentiment: "I wouldn't do it
myself, use the filesystem, but MySQL should be able to handle it."

Well WTF? There are *some* advantages to storing the data in the DB:

1) All application data in one place for backup and recovery
2) Easily scalable via replication, (somewhat less easily via) clustering
3) No need to build additional infrastructure like directory trees
4) Data readable by mysql user only

Plenty of advantages to storing on the filesystem, of course, and
number 2 above can be countered with some sort of NFS or a local cache
of a private webstore. But I like the ease of backup and the privacy
afforded by the BLOB.

That said, I've run into a limit in the amount of data that can be
read in a single query by PHP. I haven't had time to investigate (it
was somewhere in the 16-32MB range) but that's a consideration if
you're planning to store videos or print-quality photos.

Sorry, a little Googling and MAX-ALLOWED-PACKET is now burned into my brain.

Great. The SOAP documentation could use some work. I keep on meaning
to write something up based on all the little tricks I have learned
using it, but I haven't found the time.

Honestly SOAP wasnt the toughest part, the hard part was that
arcwebservices.com doesnt provide any PHP examples all Java C#, VB, etc.  I
had to figure it out from looking at other code and i am not that good with
any of them.

However i persivered through it and am doing quite well now that i know how
to do it ;)

Thanks again everyone for all the help.

I need to generate an "options list" that is based on several status
fields. Sort of like, "if you can rub your belly, scratch your head and
stand on one foot, you can proceed past the breathalyzer test, join the
circus or run for governor of Massachusetts.
 
What started as a simple if statement has grown into multiple switch
statements with some if statements thrown in just to make things
completely confusing. While this "compresses"  a state diagram, its
getting unwieldy.
 
So now I'm thinking of throwing the whole thing into a lookup table.
 
Field A   Field B ... Field N        Options
 
While this will result in a large array and many duplicate rows (since
many of the possibilities are actually the same), it should be really
easy to maintain and a great visual aid for those unlucky souls that
inherit my code.
 
Any other  ideas? Or is a lookup table the best solution?

I was thinking of governer.

The problem with a basic lookup table isn't really that there are 
duplicates, it's that there are a finite number of fields. So if you 
ever want to expand your options list, a lot of things have to change 
(code/schema, etc)

I don't understand the problem you are trying to solve very well. Could 
you explain further?

One way is something called a Directed Graph. The directed graph data 
structure can be used to create complex dependencies and priorities. 
Then your run something called a Topological sort on the data. So now 
you say, "I'd rather not". But there is a PEAR package that implements 
this. RDF/OWL Sementic web tools can also be used for this.
Funny thing is, a directed graph and/or "network" can also be 
represented as a matrix, and you can run algorithms against that that 
are less generalized.

More simply though, Entity Relationship diagrams can also be useful for 
"normalizing" your data and fitting them to relational databases. If you 
can abstract these concepts you have a good chance.

Hi Cliff,

You basically have a right idea, except that you may
want to split the information into two tables.  Place
the options in a separate table where each group of
options can be cross-referenced with the information
in another table with a unique ID, something like the
following:

Table one:
     Field A   Field B ... Field N   Options_Group_ID
Table two:
     Options_Group_ID   Option_ID    option

As you may not this design will allow you to create
multiple options, in table two, pertaining to the same
row in table one.

Alerts from SecurityFocus Newsletter #335

Please take a careful look at this issue. There are several serious
vulnerabilities in the PHP and many important open source
applications including Firefox, OpenSSL, OpenSSH, mod_ssl, MySQL,
bzip2, Drupal, the TCP protocol and several Adobe products.
PHP
---
PHP Parse_Str Register_Globals Activation Weakness
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15249
This is very troubling. Attackers can turn on register_globals by
overwriting memory. If the site running via mod_php, register_globals
will then stay on until Apache is restarted. PHP 5.1 and 4.4.1 contain
the necessary fixes.

PHP File Upload GLOBAL Variable Overwrite Vulnerability
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15250
This dangerous issue allows the GLOBAL super-global to be overwritten
via POST (and I assume GET) data. It has been resolved by changes in
5.1 and 4.4.1.

PHP PHPInfo Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15248
This isn't a big deal since nobody exposes the output of phpinfo() to

Fun problem Cliff...

I wrote this program to explore the possibilities...

Depending on the complexity of your situation, something like this 
might work.

We're setting up parameters and turning the options on and off till 
we've got a list of valid options.

This example is not very complex, but the concept could be expanded.

The trigger arrays could get more complex, and you could map actual 
field values to a 'y' or 'n' condition.

Two additional trigger arrays could be added, for cases when fields 
return false values

// a list of all the fieldnames

$field_list = array('field_a','field_b','field_c','field_d');

// a list of all the options

$options = array('option_a','option_b','option_c');

Before anyone gets really worried, these issues were fixed months ago. 
Dan is asking the SF folks to see what's up.

Cliff & Glenn:

What, pray tell, are you guys doing?

Glen, I ran your code and received an "option_b" -- what does that 
mean? Is it fatal?

Tedd,

Uh.. well.. uh..

I don't know exactly what Cliff is doing, but it seemed like he wanted 
to replace
a lot of conditional logic with something easier to maintain.
I'm having fun exploring possible solutions...

Probably to my reputation...

Cliff,

Here's the next revision of the logic...

I think it would be better to just define a list of fields that must 
ALL be true if an option
is to be displayed.

Then, if there are any fields that, if true, would cause the option NOT 
to be displayed
check for those.

Anyway, here's the code.

<html>

<?php

// If the status fields contain simple true or false values this might 
work

// example values for testing
$field_vals['field_a'] = 'y';
$field_vals['field_b'] = 'y';
$field_vals['field_c'] = 'y';
$field_vals['field_d'] = 'n';

// a list of all the fieldnames

$field_list = array('field_a','field_b','field_c','field_d');

// a list of all the options

$options = array('option_a','option_b','option_c');

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// begin options maintenence area
// control options use here
//
// $trigger_include_option: if ALL of these fields are true,
// INclude the option on the options list
//
// $trigger_exclude_option: if ANY of these fields are true,
// EXclude the option from the options list
//

$trigger_include_option['option_a'] = 
array('field_a','field_b','field_c');
$trigger_exclude_option['option_a'] = array('field_d');

$trigger_include_option['option_b'] = array('field_a','field_c');
$trigger_exclude_option['option_b'] = array('field_d');

$trigger_include_option['option_c'] = array('field_d');
$trigger_exclude_option['option_c'] = array('field_c');

// end of options maintenence area
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// loop on the multidimensional array and set $use_option[$option]
// to either 'y' or 'n' for each conditional.
// when we're finished, if $use_option[$option] is set to 'y'
// we can use it.

foreach ($trigger_include_option as $option=>$field_list) {

    $use_option[$option] = 'n';

    foreach ($field_list as $field) {
       if ($field_vals[$field] == 'y') {
          $use_option[$option] = 'y';
       }
       else {
          $use_option[$option] = 'n';
       }
    }

}

// check for any true fields that could exclude an option
// from the list

foreach ($trigger_exclude_option as $option=>$field_list) {

    foreach ($field_list as $field) {
       if ($field_vals[$field] == 'y') {
          $use_option[$option] = 'n';
       }
    }

}

// now show the available options

print "<ul>";

foreach($options as $option) {

    if ($use_option[$option] == 'y') {
       print "<li>$option</li>\n";
    }

}

print "</ul>";

/**

?>

Glenn:

Very cool solution.

I tried writing a couple of simple cases. Here's what I came up with:

This one is very clean, but it breaks up the search key and options into two 
tables. This provides a lot of flexibility, but is a bit hard on the eyes -- 
easy to make a mistake in the options table.

$lookup = array(
	array('pending','pending','pending'),
	array('pending','pending','inprocess'),
	array('pending','pending','completed'),
	array('pending','inprocess','inprocess'),
	array('pending','completed','inprocess'));

$options = array('dothis',
		'dothat',
		'dotheotherthing',
		'dothis',
		'anotheroption');

$currentstate = array('pending','pending','completed');

$key = array_search($state, $lookup);

if ($key === false)
	echo 'not in lookup table';
else
        echo $options[$key];

This one combines the "needle" with the resultant process . Very easy to 
follow and maintain, but the computational load for the implodes concerns 
me. I guess some sort of precompile could be implemented.

$lookup2 = array(
	implode(array('pending','pending','pending')) => 'do this',
	implode(array('pending','pending','inprocess')) => 'do that',
	implode(array('pending','pending','completed')) => 'do something',
	implode(array('pending','inprocess','inprocess')) => 'do another',
	implode(array('pending','completed','inprocess')) => 'do whatever');

$state2 = implode(array('pending','pending','completed'));

if (array_key_exists($state2, $lookup2))
      echo $lookup2[$state2];
else
	echo 'not in lookup table';

Hello Robert,

Your forum is using phpBB, which is a free and very good PHP/MySQL message
forum script.  What exactly are you trying to modify - the page layout, or
the actual forums themselves (such as adding new forums, or renaming
existing forums)?

If you're talking about modifying the page layout, you do not touch the
index.php page - but rather you modify the template page that is used to
build the index page.  If you're looking to modify the forums, you need to
login to the phpBB admin area to do this.  It's been awhile since I've used
phpBB, but I do believe you can reach your admin area by appending
/admin/index.php to your forum URL.  Then of course you will need the admin
username/password.

If you can be a bit more specific with what you actually need to do, I'm
sure one of the good folks here on the list can give you the exact fix
you're looking for.

good luck!
Kevin Gibbons

Hi,
First of, thanks to everyone for the responses -- especially to Carlos for
the clever SQL.  (Sorry if I've missed new posts, been away for a few days.)

Alrighty.  Basically, we're redesigning a site that ultimately contains over
100k records (table a) that belong to over 300 sections (table b).  (Each
week, the editors will upload 50+ new records, which may or may not contain
new sections.)

The redesign is an all-CSS layout.  For the section landing page, we're
showing the 5 most recent records, followed by a two-column layout
displaying the next 30 or so.

Each 'column' is essentially a <div> block, so I want to show all even
records in the left block;  all odd records in the right.  (Editors can
choose sort-order, turn records on and off or simply display all in
reverse-cron, so accuracy is important.)  I've been playing around with SQL
to do this as I'd rather not put the weight on PHP.

(This is all working, BTW.)

See above for sorting rules, but I just want to say that a pet peeve of mine
is text-entries in the db for boolean logic.  Why not something like odd=0
|| odd=1?

The legacy site we're redesigning here actually had doNotShow='yes' ||
doNotShow='no' in the db.  I banged my head on the desk when I saw this.  It
not only takes more memory to retrieve & test the results, but the logic in
this case is in reverse.  Every time I'd look at a record, I'd have to ask
myself, "Do I not want to show the record?  No, I do not want to not show
it."

These are now display=1 || display=0.  It is far more easier to test:

if($record['display']) {}

Than it is:

if($record['doNotShow']=='no') {}


(Just had to get that off my chest..)

Oh, why didn't you ask?

Try this:

<?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++)
	{
	echo($i & 1);
	echo("<br/>");
	}
?>

If you count the records, then just run that count (i.e., $i) through 
the above to determine odd = 1 for odd and odd = 0 for even.

HTH's.

Message-ID: <000901c62b5c$d97e8190$68e4a144@Rubicon>

The content of Chris Shiflett's Essential PHP Security from O'Reilly is
poised right now to be put online as a Wiki. 
 
It should accept about 90 days of moderated updates and then be openly
promoted as the accepted, standardized "Using PHP Securely" guide for all
PHP programmers.
 
Then Rasmus and Zeev (and Hans) have to step up and openly support this type
of essential security awareness.
 
All PHP user groups (like NYPHP) should openly, actively promote secure
programming awareness right in the membership documentation and on every
home page. 
 
Php.net should have Security as a menu item in the main horizontal menu
right there with Downloads and Documentation.
 
All PHP tutorials online that are old with insecure practices should have a
simple one line link right under the tutorial title:
"This tutorial may contain insecure techniques. See: [standardized,
industry-supported secure PHP programming article] here before you begin."
 
Can't wait for PHP 6 and Sandbox environments.
 
Additionally, I have promoted in this venue before that the default php.ini
from php.net should be a hardened .ini with shell and fopen functions
disabled by default. Open_basedir should expect a mandatory value. 
 
Save errors to a log should be the default, with the alternative option to
show on the screen. Error_log should expect mandatory value.
 
Until further refinement safe_mode=on.
 
We have to start somewhere. We have to start now. We can't wait for some
incredible overarching solution or framework that is just going to appear
because that is not the way most progress happens.
 
Most progress, even in technology, occurs when a person adds another tweak,
another enhancement, another update. 
 
PHP security needs to be further demystified. Security has to be a basic
building block comparable to learning datatypes.
 
Chris's guide is quite sufficient to help engender a positive change in the
nature of how we all program PHP.
 
Someday I really, really want to have a safe online, PHP-driven, Google-like
personal searchable database that catalogs my entire
financial/personal/health/educational/job history and automatically pulls in
the XML-based attributes of all my belongings so that I can
reference/manage/schedule/transfer/purchase/send anything from anywhere in
the world on my biometrically protected cellular/pda/player. 
 
Only intense trusted security is going to make that possible.
 
Start now yourself. Employ and propagate essential PHP security everywhere.

I'll rephrase the above so we can be sure that we're on the same 
page. Logically you have a result set of records 1-35 sorted by 
whatever sorting algorithm the editor has selected. And you now aim 
for following structure (ASCII presentation, use fixed width font to 
view):

+------------------------------+
| DIV          1               |
|              2               |
|              3               |
|              4               |
|              5               |
+------------------------------+
+-------------+ +--------------+
|DIV   6      | |DIV    7      |
|      8      | |       9      |
|     10      | |      11      |
|     12      | |      13      |
|    ...      | |     ...      |
|     34      | |      35      |
+-------------+ +--------------+

So the source order is

<div>1 2 3 4 5</div>
<div>6 8 10 ... 34</div>
<div>7 9 11 ... 35</div>

??

If this is the case, I'd suggest you to use table layout instead.

In my opinion, the biggest reason to use pure CSS layout is to 
*correctly* markup the semantics of the document. If the ordering of 
the records is meaningful, then the *source* order is the *most* 
important thing. The source *must* contain report 7 between reports 
6 and 8, unlike above. Using a table and putting each report to its 
own cell will accomplish this. However, if you think the collection 
of reports you're displaying isn't really a piece of tabular data 
(which I think it isn't), then you shouldn't (semantically) use 
<table> to display it. On the other hand, using <table> and correct 
source order is less wrong than using no <table> but incorrect 
source order.

Saying that, I'm aware that it's *really* hard to achieve the 
correct table-like rendering in MSIE with the correct source order. 
All I'm saying is that if the table-like rendering in MSIE is more 
important than correct source order, then I think you should *NOT* 
change to true CSS layout. It's not worth it! Only use true CSS 
layout if using it *allows* you to use correct source order.

The New York City Homeschool Education Alliance (NYCHEA.org) is
looking for a volunteer Drupal developer to help them with an
application that may be migrated to their website (address management
for mailings etc).

Is there anyone that would be interested in picking this up? I'd do
it, but it ain't Joomla ;-)

Mitch,

Let me know some more of the details.... I just migrated www.wagner.edu
to be 100% drupal (from a coldfusion/IIS server to two LAMPs!) Took
quite a while. But if they need some integration help, maybe I could be
of service. No promises, but I'll help if I can.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] upload error
Message-ID: <43EA696A.3090900@aarond.com>

I'm having some trouble running an upload form on Mac OS X, IE 5.2

My servers are windows IIS, running php 4.3.   The form works fine for 
Mac Safari, and IE/Mozilla on windows 2000, so I'm not sure what the 
difference is. I just check for the ',jpg' extension, and _FILE error 
code =0  then use move_uploaded_file.  On the Mac/Safari test, it 
doesn't return an error, but shows 0 for file size.

(I used the same image for Mac/PC tests so I know it goes through on the pc)

Any ideas?

thanks,
Aaron D.

I just noticed that some jpg files will get uploaded, but others won't. 
Strange.
I'm not sure what the difference is yet.

Post the code.

$_FILES['upload']['type'] doesn't _always_ return the same thing with 
different browsers...so, if you are relying on that...don't.


 From the docs:

http://us3.php.net/features.file-upload

"The mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An 
example would be "image/gif". This mime type is however not checked on 
the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted."

Could be a couple of things: a) size -- check the size. I've had 
jpg's load only a portion because of size limits; 2) some jpgs have 
jpeg suffix -- check suffix and the defaults with your server.

Looks like it isn't a weblication, but more of a client application
problem. Ultimately they keep a database of mailing addresses and need
to find a way of centralizing that data, and also allowing for a "Mail
Merge"-like feature to integrate with Word.

Maybe there is something for Drupal that could manage the address
book, and then provide a handy export to a Word-compatible format?

Here is an example

*My simple code*

<form name="imgform" action="test.php" method="POST" 
enctype="multipart/form-data">
Image File
<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="2100000">
<input type="file" name="imgfile">
<input type="submit">
</form>

<?php
if($_FILES['imgfile'])
{
 move_uploaded_file( $_FILES['imgfile']['tmp_name'], 
'testimg/'.$_FILES['imgfile']['name'] ); 
} // end post
?>


For test images I just google image searched 'birds' and picked the swan 
image (2nd one)
http://lynx.uio.no/jon/gif/animals/birds/swans.jpg

This works on Mac safari, PC IE/Mozilla/Firefox but not Mac IE.  When I 
try to open the file on my pc it says 'Can't determine type'

Any thoughts?  Is this sample image faulty?

hi all,

If you're running a search engine friendly URL mod for your bulletin
board system, you should read this.

If you're using FURL with IPB, you MUST read this.

Basically, I just found out that the URL mod I've been running on our
company forums is google spamming.

Here's the whole blog entry, but you might want to see it with
pictures at http://www.prusak.com

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you promoting someone else's site without even knowing it?
My tale of being victim to a below-the-belt SEO tactic.

Recently, we added user forums to our company web site, in order to
give our customers and potential customers a place to voice their
questions and opinions. We settled on using Invision Power Board (IPB)
which runs using PHP and MySQL.

A couple of weeks ago I installed a modification to our forums which
makes the URL of the pages appear to be static html pages and it also
inserts the topic title into the URL. The modification package (also
called a "mod") is called FURL, which is short for "Friendly URL".
Friendly meaning the URLs are more search engine friendly.

After installing the FURL modification, instead of using this URL:
http://forum.resperate.com/index.php?showtopic=19
it uses this URL:
http://forum.resperate.com/My-doctor-said-pills-for-the-rest-of-your-life-t19.html

Both of the above URLs take you to the same page, but the second one
both looks nicer, and is supposed to improve search engine placement.

Last night, I wanted to check if Google was picking up the URLs with
the static or dynamic URLs, so I searched for a pretty unique phrase
from one of the pages: "It sounds like RESPeRATE is working well for
you" and surely enough, the page had been picked up, but the URL it
was showing was the dynamic one, not the static one.

I was curious to see how Google was seeing the page so I clicked on
the cached button:



That's when my jaw dropped

There was some additional stuff I had never seen before at the top of
the page which looked like this:



Instead of the normal forum section header which looks like this:



The modification I installed didn't just modify the URLs. It also
added, unknowingly to me, some extra text at the top of the page as
well as some links to other pages - but the added text was only being
shown to the Google spider, and was not visible to a normal human
viewing the site. This alone can get you banned from Google.

The fact that FURL adds this content is not mentioned anywhere in the
documentation or installation instructions.

It really saddens me that the author of FURL added a very underhanded
tactic improve their search engine rankings.
If they would have added a small footer to the bottom the page that
was shown to everyone, I would have been perfectly OK with that and
would have left it.

It seems that quite a few sites have FURL installed and are affected
by this SEO hack. If you do a search for "SEO Powered by FURL" in
Google, it says over 2 million results.

* sigh *

If FURL is free software (free as in free speech), take the source and 
create a fork of it which does not add the junk that you mentioned.  If 
it is not free, create your own and change the world for good :-)

PS: I don't use any bulletin board systems, so I have never come across 
the problem you mentioned.

Hey Guys,

I would appreciate any help i can get with this problem.

Based on a customers zip code when they come to the site we generate a list
of vendors and vendor locations and they are loaded into an array like this

www,codebowl.com/array.txt

what i need to do is loop over the vendor locations and sort them based on
the distance.  Currently it looks sorted but that is only because 2 records
are showing.

so in this case it is correct.  the end goal is to get the 2 closest
locations then get the closest based on total street miles.

is there current code out there that could do this?

Thanks,

You can use usort with a function that compares the distance key.

See example 2:  http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.usort.php

Message-ID: <000201c62e7b$28de7300$0aa8a8c0@cliff>

Is there any way to typecast a function argument like:
 
public function Partytime(int $argument)         // this actually
expects an object of class int
 
or 
 
public function Partytime( (int)$argument)      // this barfs
 
sure would be nice when my next line is:
 
if ($argument ===...    which I really like over == for some stange
reason -- keeps me honest.
 
You get the idea.

I haven't done this, but you might use Google's map services.

Nope. Type hints (your first version) don't work on primitives and you 
can't execute commands (your second version) in a function/method 
signature (except setting defaults).

No.  What you're trying to do is type hinting, which only works for the
compound types: classes (as of 5) and arrays (as of 5.1). See:
    http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php

Maybe someday the other (scalar) primitives will make it in there.

So is it best to abandon ifs with === and !==? I think they are great
for validation and flag checking (like setting a variable to a result
set or Boolean false). But I might have gotten ahead of myself using
them too liberally, which is now a bit worrisome and creating a few
problems...and overtime.

hey bob,

You need to locate your current Themes index_body.tpl. 
Usually located under Templates -> "Name of your current Theme" -> index_body.tpl

In there you'll see familiar HTML. Somewhere between the end of the U_Search Table code block and the beginning of the next Table (the category layout table) insert another UNCLOSED table and utilize it to place your link in.

Example:

  <a href="{U_SEARCH_UNANSWERED}" class="gensmall">{L_SEARCH_UNANSWERED}</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<-- end of table -->
<-- beginning of my new 'link table' -->

<table font size="-4" width="100%" border="0"><tr><td font size="-4" valign="top"> 
<a href="http://www.albanycrpc.org/" target="_self"><b font size="-4">Home</b></a><br>
<a href="http://reformedpresbytery.org/ss_order.html" target="_self"><b font size="-4">Doctrine</b><br>
<a href="http://reformedpresbytery.org/about.html"><b font size="-4">About</b><br>
<a href="mailto:Webmaster at AlbanyCRPC.org" target="_self"><b font size="-4">Contact</b><br> 
</td>
<td width="100%" valign="top"> 

<--Notice The link table is not closed, do that at the bottom of the page -->

<table width="100%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0" class="forumline">

Hi Peter,

Can you elaborate? There are no plans to do this, although I've 
considered enhancing the PHP Security Guide to be a condensed version of 
the book. This would require some negotiation with O'Reilly. :-)

There are a few free resources available online, including two free 
chapters and most of the code:

http://phpsecurity.org/

> It should accept about 90 days of moderated updates and then be
> openly promoted as the accepted, standardized "Using PHP
> Securely" guide for all PHP programmers.

Web application security is a young and evolving discipline, so any 
useful documentation should evolve as well.

I know what you mean. Ideally, online resources that teach bad practices 
would be corrected, but the sheer magnitude of this problem makes any 
progress difficult.

> Additionally, I have promoted in this venue before that the

I definitely agree that allow_url_fopen should be disabled by default, 
at least in php.ini-recommended.

Agreed. Given the right background, it's a pretty simple topic.

I sure hope so. :-)

BTW, are there any code analysis or static analysis tools for automatically
detecting security problems that you describe in your book?
Zend IDE seem to do some shallow code analysis (at least that is the
impression I get when I read their IDE product description...)

I know what you mean. Ideally, online resources that teach bad practices
would be corrected, but the sheer magnitude of this problem makes any
progress difficult.

I definitely agree that allow_url_fopen should be disabled by default,
at least in php.ini-recommended.

Agreed. Given the right background, it's a pretty simple topic.

I sure hope so. :-)

There are penetration testing tools, and these are pretty easy to write 
yourself.

Analyzing code is more challenging than it sounds, because your task 
winds up being a substantial subset of what a code parser does - you 
have to be able to reliably interpret code and what it does, tracking 
data the entire time, and making educated guesses about potential 
safeguards. There are some recent PHP extensions written by Sara Golemon 
that can help, but it's still a very non-trivial task.

I do a fair number of PHP security audits, and most of my process still 
revolves around a manual inspection of the code.

Interesting... I am also just starting to  look at the possibility of
annotating PHP code to improve analyzability of PHP code...Do you have
pointers to Sara's extentions?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT ? Insurance Question
Message-ID: <61ed8cf29791d562cc5969c7a2174213@mac.com>

Hi all,

I'm in the NYC, USA area.

I have a potential contracting job and I'm thinking
that I need to have some good errors and omissions
insurance, and other insurance as well.

This would be programming work in a mission-critical environment, and
in an industry with high liability.

I'm hoping some of the folks on this list can recommend
insurance companies that have a positive reputation.

Any other comments on the subject are also most welcome.

Best Regards,

Glenn

It worries me that this even needs to be thought about these days ...  
Im interested in why the company that hires you for this would not  
provide such insurance ... I have read at least a dozen items this  
year alone which shows developers getting *sued* for just bad  
mouthing or giving a good opinion on why not to buy a product in  
their blogs.  While its not the same as a mission-critical situation  
I find it troublesome that you would need "online insurance" these  
days if you are programming via contract work :-\

All contracters should have errors and ommissions coverage.  It's been 
that way for as long as I've been contracting.

This is a more serious matter than Ohpir initially suggested, and I dug 
a bit deeper into it and wrote about it on ThreadWatch.org.

The code was distributed as a free mod for the forum software, and was 
advertised/promoted as a means of making a site more "search engine 
friendly". In actuality, not only did it spam google by embedding 
backlinks onto your website, but it did so by cloaking the site by 
user-agent, so that search engine spiders were fed a different version 
of your website than regular visitors. Since cloaking is a blatant 
violation of the Google terms of service,  this mod that was advertised 
as a way to make your site more search engine friendly could actually 
get your site banned.

*** I repeat: it inserted cloaking by user-agent, which would get your 
site banned by Google if discovered.

Of course code that ads/modifies mod-rewrite rules is never trivial 
code, so it is likely that many PHP coders would accept the rewrite 
rules and associated code without line-by-line review. Had they looked 
very closey at the code, they would have found not only the backlinks 
and the cloaking by user-agent, but a disclosure statement from the 
author in the comments. He appended this code to the top of your pages 
(note the randomization of the anchor text.. nice touch!):

foreach( explode( "\n", $this->ipsclass->vars['search_engine_bots'] ) as 
$bot )
{
list($ua, $n) = explode( "=", $bot );
    if ( $ua and $n ){
        $this->bot_map[ strtolower($ua) ] = $n;
        $this->bot_safe[] = preg_quote( $ua, "/" );
    }
}
if ( preg_match( '/('.implode( '|', $this->bot_safe ) .')/i', 
$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], $match ) )
{
    print "SEO Powered By FURL 3.1 By KiM (<a 
href='http://www.alt-man.co.uk'>Alternative Manchester</a>)<br/><br/>";
    $url1 = 
array("http://www.authors-website.tld","http://www.authors-website.tld");
    $keywords1 = array("","Alternative 
Manchester","Manchester","Events","Local","Punk Rock","Music","Punk"...);

    for($x;$x<=2;$x++){
        $randurl = rand(0,1);
        $rand1 = rand(0, 30);
        $rand2 = rand(0, 30);
        $rand3 = rand(0, 30);
        $rand4 = rand(0, 30);
        $url = 
"{$keywords1[$rand1]}-{$keywords1[$rand2]}-{$keywords1[$rand3]}-se.html";
        $this->ipsclass->skin['_wrapper'].= " - {$keywords1[$rand4]} - 
<a href='{$url1[$randurl]
}

{$url}'>{$keywords1[$rand1]} {$keywords1[$rand2]} {$keywords1[$rand3]}</a>";
}
}

Interesting that the last comment is Kim claiming that this was an
accident and he's removed the offending code from the latest version.

I'm working on an accounting text file parser, and they have a date 
variable that represents the number of days since 01/01/1968

I have to take that number and convert it mm/dd/yyyy

*Example*
Date variable:..: 3919
Summary...........: UniData's Internal Date & Time
Description.......: Date: 4/4/2005

Any suggestions on what php functions to use? I know some don't go 
further back than 1970.

thanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] UTF8 Windows vs. Linux differences with PHP
Message-ID: <41c21c5d0602131146i4bc14566l@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a question regarding the utf8 function in php. We have an
application that gets some UTF encoded data and stores it in a UTF
encoded Oracle 9 database. We are managing the encoding with
utf8-encode and utf8-decode.

But depending on wihcih platform we are running the application we
have different results.

PHP under Windows and Oracle under Windows everything works like a
charm. We can read and write from Oracle and receive from and send to 
UTF Frontend (Macromedia Flex btw.)

But on the staging system nothing works any more. PHP runs there under
Linux and Oracle under Solaris.

I am pretty sure it is not an Oracle problem but I do not know for
what to search in the php configuration in order to provide utf
encoding and decoding functionality under Linux...

Any suggestions are highly appreciated...

Thanks in advance and

best regards

I don't know of any reason to suspect it was intentional. The backlinks 
are commonly understood to be valuable, hence the insertion in exchange 
for the free mod. And everybody knows that if you plastered 13 backlinks 
at the top of people's sites they would not like that... and probably 
not use the mod. Since IPB already maintains a bot class definition (for 
stats and the like) and Kim was already re-writing (internally 
redirecting)  the site at the header level....it might have made sense 
at the time to only serve the ugly links to search engine bots.

As much as "SEO" has become a household word for coders and script 
kiddies in the past year, it should really be left to the professionals. 
By its very nature, competitive webmastering seeks to define an existing 
practice standard (through observation) and then exploit loopholes left 
by the standard practice ("exploit market inefficiencies"). In other 
words, once everybody is talking about how backlinks help you rank, 
professional SEOs are on to the next thing and it isn't long before 
backlinks are penalized by the SEs as a means of eliminating spam (as 
happened in the fall of 2005).
I agree a problem is the tremendous amount of bad advice out there, but 
from what I can see it is also true for PHP coding, security, etc. 
Caveat emptor and all that.

By the way, the mod author has responded on ThreadWatch that he was 
unaware of the risks of the cloaking tactic  deployed, and has removed 
it from the latest version available for download. I took a look and the 
backlinks are gone, the cloaking is gone, and any mention of them is 
gone. I don't use IPB so I can't say it works or works well, but it 
appears to have been cleaned up. http://www.threadwatch.org/node/5589

Of course any mod that inserts code into the view controller and/or 
server level redirecting (re-writing) has to be watched very carefully. 
Lesson learned?

Check the "default_charset" variable in php.ini (you can see it through
phpinfo()). If you're not setting the encoding type, the server might be
passing the default one in the header.

Hello Carlos,

thank you for your answer, but it didn't solve the problem. I still
have a wrong behaviour in UTF8 Encoding and Decoding with PHP under
LInux and Windows.

Another suggestions are highly appreciated...

Thanks in advance

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PhP5.1.1 Multi threaded cross platform compilation
	issues
Message-ID: <AAB4B3D3CF0F454F98272CBE187FDE2F0A057EE5@is0004avexu1.global.avaya.com>

I have a problem that the PHP configure seems to automatically disable
pthreads when I compile on cross platfrom.
Host: i686-pentium-linux
Target: ppc-powerquicc-linux
 
More details about the target machine:
PowerQuicc II MPC8248
 
My configure file is as follows:
'./configure' \
'--cache-file=config.cache' \
'--disable-debug' \
'--enable-memory-limit' \
'--enable-pic' \
'--enable-safe-mode' \
'--enable-sockets' \
'--enable-track-vars' \
'--enable-trans-sid' \
'--enable-wddx' \
'--sysconfdir=/home/yoav/export/etc/appWeb' \
'--with-exec-dir=/home/yoav/export/etc/appWeb/exec' \
'--with-regex=system' \
'--with-pear' \
'--with-xml' \
'--with-xmlrpc' \
'--enable-bcmath' \
'--enable-calendar' \
'--enable-force-cgi-redirect' \
'--enable-ftp' \
'--enable-inline-optimization' \
'--enable-magic-quotes' \
'--disable-rpath' \
'--with-zlib' \
'--with-db' \
'--enable-embed=shared' \
'--with-gnu-ld' \
'--prefix=/home/yoav/export/etc/php5' \
'--target=ppc-powerquicc-linux' \
'--enable-maintainer-zts' \
'--with-tsrm-pthreads' 
 
Using ZTS as an application I would like to use (AppWeb) required it and
I must have a multi threaded version of PHP.
Looking at the configure file it seems that PHP automatically chooses to
disable pthreads once it detects it's a cross platform compilation.
 
Thanks,
 
Yoav.

Thats curious.  I see the code in the configure script that you
describe.  It also makes an exception for netware.

I'd suggest asking the core developers as they'd know why pthreads is
handled that way in the case of cross compiling.

Any reason you *must* cross compile?  No chance of building on the
target?

HTH,
Andrew

The target is this really weak box, an embedded system. I contacted
Zand, and they were a bit baffled, but they will look into it more and
we will see. I am not very optimistic right now, but there must be a
solution.

Have you tried modifying the configure script to add an exception for
your case and seeing what happens?  Its probably best to understand
*why* it does what it does, but its worth a shot.

You might try asking about this on the php internals list.

why does anyone have to buy out zend, isnt the company doing well enough on
it's own 2 feet?

I would hate to see the prices of Zend products jump if they were bought out
by oracle.  What would this mean for the products, would they continue
development or are they buying them out just to get the product they want to
continue?  I do not know much about this except that one paragraph but i
would hate to see zend sold, maybe a funding partnership or something but
zend has a great product line now and i see it continuously growing.

Thanks,

To make both parties wealthier, that is always why it is done.  The 
owners of Zend cash out, and Oracle gets to steer the product where they 
will.

But of course right now it is only rumor.

But let's say Oracle wants to buy Zend... does IBM put in their own
bid? Does Yahoo? And who is the publicist that started these "rumors"
anyway... ?

It isn't about saving Zend from financial ruin. Its about grabbing a 
hold of their market share and profits. If they buy Zend, they own all 
of the Zend products. Then they get the money from selling them and they 
can control the development. They can make Zend products really easy to 
integrate with Oracle. That means people will be more likely to buy 
Oracle products.

Honestly, it's another big-business vote for PHP, and (hopefully) for 
open-source. Despite some success, Oracle's never been quite as 
successful as they'd have liked on the applications front (did they ever 
succeed in buying PeopleSoft? I can't even remember). Not that I'm 
saying it's a good or bad thing overall, but if you were Oracle, 
wouldn't you like to have zillions of PHP programmers (and a few good 
ones :-)) able to write useful applications quickly for your platform?

I realize it's just a rumor, but Oracle sees the wind blowing away from 
java, toward PHP, like the rest of us. That's why it's a believable rumor.

I hope they do better than Macromedia with Coldfusion who made 
Dreamweaver so easy to integrate. (not that I ever used Coldfusion)

Generally, I think it's a bad idea. I would like to see Oracle be 
friends with Zend, not BE Zend.
Maybe it is what Zend wants. Who wouldn't want a money so the rest of 
your life you can do "whatever you want" with your time? Maybe even 
something more important than PHP.... :/

I'm ignorant of the Zend Platform for Oracle.  But in principle, Oracle 
could save a lot of money if they just made easier-to-use tools.
They might as well donate tools that simplify everyones life to an open 
source platform. They should do it for Ruby, Python, IDEs. etc.
And they should build easy to use interfaces.
Maybe they should think about buying MySQL instead. :)

You might want to check out Zend Core for Oracle.  It probably has a lot of 
what you'd like as far as easy installation with PHP and a web-based admin 
GUI.  Core is separate from Zend Platform and can be downloaded for free 
online.  There is also a paid support option via Zend Network.

http://www.zend.com/core/oracle

You can see the installation guide on that page to get an idea of what it's 
like.  Also, a Windows version was just released for developers on that platform.

If I'm not mistaken, Zend Core for Oracle does not include Oracle
itself, only the extension & client libs....

So, there is also Oracle 10g Express Edition ... "free to develop,
deploy, and distribute ... for Developers working on PHP ...":

I guess I should chime in here too... The Zend Core for IBM comes with the 
DB2 client which can be used to connect to the included Cloudscape (Derby) 
embedded database or any version of DB2. 

It can then be used with the newly released DB2 Express-C which is free 
(as in a free keg):

It's important to understand that Zend Core is actually more than just 
libraries.  Core is actually a PHP distribution from Zend, analogous to how 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a Linux distribution from Red Hat.

You wouldn't download PHP from php.net and then install Core on top of it. 
You'd just install Zend Core and that would give you PHP with Oracle or DB2 
support.  You have a database, then install Core, and you end up with a 
complete system.

The difference here is that Core follows a different release cycle than 
mainstream PHP.  It is actually built separately by Zend and is always tested 
against the bundled database libraries.

Similar to how the major Linux distributions work, Core doesn't contain all 
the bleeding-edge features of PHP 5.1.2.  However, the newer features are 
merged in as part of the release cycle after they are QA'ed against the rest 
of the Core distribution.  The aim of Zend Core is to provide a version of PHP 
for use with Oracle or DB2 that is stable and supported.

Need to do tests to figure out where the issue is.

Is PHP messing it up before sending it to the database?
Is the databse messing it up?
Is PHP warping the data when it sends it to user output?

You need to make tests to check each scenario.

I made some tests and discovered that the data is corrupted before
encoding i.e. the data si coming from Oracle in a bad encoding.
Further tests revealed that I am pretty sure a environment variable
for Oracle is missing.

So I will search in this direction or ask Oracle Support.

Thanks again

Would be nice to have a presentation on this, either at a meeting or at
NYPHPCon 2006, since I don't think this is very well known.  It'd be
interesting to hear about the specific advantages core provides, outside of
a web control panel and XYZ database libraries.

Howdy:

Well, Oracle's buying spree continues, with the acquisition of SleepyCat, 
the folks who make Berkeley DB.  BDB is also used by MySQL.  As mentioned 
earlier, Oracle also purchased Innobase, the makers of the InnoDB engine 
used by MySQL.

to gather data and set actions for the presentation layer. That's fine.
 
What disturbs me is that I need to do this all over again when receiving
actionable input, going along with the theory that all input from the
client is evil unless proved otherwise. Thank you Chris...
 
So now I need to run a query again, check to see if the particular
action is allowed based on the data gathered and than act upon it if the
action is valid. The joy of an open client-server system.
 
Do I just accept this and get on with it? Do I maintain the query
results and state info with sessions, which I have avoided to date
because I believe sessions have their own scalability baggage? Comments?

You're welcome? :-)

Can you give us a more concrete example? It seems likely that you can 
avoid having to query the database multiple times just to be able to 
maintain a healthy level of suspicion.

Thanks for the reply Chris -- see, I've become a believer...

Ok, so here's one case:

I display a bunch of rows. Each row has several fields, including a few
status fields (some displayed, some not).

Various actions (buttons) are allowed based on combinations of the
status fields. (As a side-note, this relates to the state table thread I
started last week). I disable buttons that are not allowed, so only
valid actions can be submitted, but it would be trivial to submit a
button that has been disabled.

When I receive a button submission for a particular row, I query the row
from the db, and check to see if this action is allowed based upon the
status fields.

If it were as simple as checking for a userid, I could do a single step
update on the row using something like WHERE row = submittedrowid and
userid = guyloggedin. In fact, I will probably double check the logic
flow to see if the validation and DB update can be compressed into a
single query. Like "UPDATE SET price = price + submission WHERE fields
meet conditions" Failed update == failed validation, or something like
that. But the button actions are based on a complex set of status codes
and launch a flurry of processes. So this scenario might not work.

Stream of consciousness going here... As I think about this, it seems
like I can still only compress a DB read and write to a single update --
with a lot of work.

What about some sort of encrypted key stored in a hidden field on the
client side? I could encrypt all the possible options and then cross
check the submission against the encrypted value. I guess that's just
shifting state info to the client -- is that safe if its encrypted?

Thoughts?

You can pass a bunch of hidden variables and a hash of these variables with
a secret key to validate if they were tampered with. And if you do it
correctly, you can achieve some security with it.
This, btw, is used in simple integration schemas by some merchant gateways
to validate submitted information: You send your data (cc, amount, etc...)
and an md5 hash of the concatenation of all these variables and a secret
key. On their side, they calculate the hash again (only you and them can
know the key), and if it doesn't match, parameters were tampered.

Keep in mind most applications should be ok handling the query to the
database. Since you already need the database connection for the update,
and with a query cache, the overhead of the second query might be
negligible and your code might be much simpler.

Carlos:

Sounds like an interesting approach. I like it for scaling out.

But you make an interesting point regarding the second query -- caching
could reduce the load significantly. And regarding simplicity, I've been
leaning more and more towards just getting the application finished and
worrying about performance later. I hate to admit that, but planning for
a hundred million users seems senseless if the application is never
finished.

This earlier quote from Mickos made me smile: 

"MySQL freely admits that its database is totally different from the 
high-end offerings of IBM and Oracle. It's trying to be the Ikea of the 
database world: cheap, needs some assembly, but has a sleek, modern design 
and does the job. "If you are equipping some very fine room for your old 
relatives, maybe you buy antique furniture. But everyone else uses Ikea," 
Mickos says."

but to the point - I'd have to add, it really depends on how big of a

If this is an ecommerce site - then obviously security is a very big deal.
if it's a bulletin board on an intranet ...

well, you get the point.

Stated differently, you're trying to be sure that the status fields you 
included in the form haven't been tampered with, right?

Carlos's suggestion is good for helping to verify integrity. It would 
also be pretty easy to modify your approach to do this instead of query 
the database. I have no idea what your SQL query looks like (which is a 
good thing), but it's a good candidate for hashing, because it 
presumably contains all of the data you're checking, you already take 
the time to construct the string, and it's something you can reliably 
reproduce.

Hope that helps.

I am bringing up a MAC mini as a web server. Thought it would be an easy

"sorry kids, no garageshop or imovie, this is strictly a web server, go
play with your Pentium II. Silly me, I don't know ls from cd. I'll never
badmouth Bill again. 
 
Tried Xampp; got fairly far, but scrapped it. Now I just have the latest
installs of MySQL and PHP5.
 
Apache is running (the native version with OSX Tiger).
MySQL 5 is running.
PHP 5.x is running.
 
PHPMyAdmin gave birth and works just fine.
 
http://localhost/blahblah/test.php works just fine and just only
phpinfo()
 
So here's the wierd part:
 
http://localhost/blahblah/index.php simply comes up empty even thought
it is identical to test.php -- just phpinfo(). No error message, no
nothing. Just blank.
 
test, test2, idx, index2, etc. .php work just fine and output phpinfo()
as expected. It is only index.php that does nothing.
 
Ideas?

First guess - permissions.
Next, either there is .htaccess , mod_rewrite, doing something.
Lastly it could be the order of the indexes available in the httpd.conf 
- so if you have a index.html it will chose that first unless you access 
index.php directly.

Download is forced through headers:

First guess - permissions.
Next, either there is .htaccess , mod_rewrite, doing something. Lastly
it could be the order of the indexes available in the httpd.conf 
- so if you have a index.html it will chose that first unless you access

index.php directly.

hi there:

this question seems so elementary, yet i can't seems to figure out 
the right combination of curly braces and whatnot.

if i have a variable variable such as:

${$uc.'content_width'} = 170;


How can I use it inside a heredoc assignment?


// start the content
${$uc.'content'} = <<< ENDENDEND


ENDENDEND;


Thanks,

$uc = 'foo';

The jump from Windows to OSX/Unix is giving me more problems. Now  
sessions aren't working -- more permission issues.

Here's my sessions directory:

It's at /private/var/tmp

My error log has the appropriate permissions. I assume nobody is the  
PHP process.

But what's with the session files? -rw------ isn't very useful is it?
I assume www is the Apache process. How do I make it create readable  
session files?

0600 (-rw-------) is perfectly appropriate for session files; apache can
read them & write to them, and nobody else can.  

I would look into why your error log is owned by nobody & your session
files are owned by www, do you have two apaches running on that machine?

or, if you manually chown'd the files, you mistakenly assumed that PHP
and Apache run as separate users.  PHP is just an extension of Apache,
so whatever is configured in Apache's conf for 'user' then  that is
what PHP's scripts need permission for.

Message-ID: <43F86761.4000304@cyberxdesigns.com>

I created a bash script that is supposed to dump one of my databases.  
When I run the bash script from the cli it dumps no problem.  When I 
call the script from cron, I get an empty file in the destination 
directory.  Anyone have any ideas?

FreeBSD 5.3
MySQL 4.1

--------------------------------
#!/usr/local/bin/bash

date=`date +"%y%m%d-%H%M%S"`
filename=$path$date"-oncellrx.sql"

mysqldump --opt -Q -uUSER -pPASS DATABASE > $filename
------------------------------------

I am calling the script as myself from cron.  Bash is set as my shell in 
passwd.  Seems sorta mysterious to me.

Have you checked your user's mail spool for any output from the cron?

Your personal user might not have the permissions to write to
/usr/local/backups.  Try running the cron job as root.

Probably a permissions or path problem... first do:

which mysqldump

and then use the absolute path of mysqldump in the script.

I did something like this myself.  If I remember correctly, I also ran
into this problem until I defined my $HOME dir, as scripts executed
via cron do not have the full user initialization that you get when
you actually log into a *nix box.

It was a path problem.  Fully qualifying the path to mysqldump worked. 

#!/usr/local/bin/bash
path="/usr/local/backups/"

date=`date +"%y%m%d-%H%M%S"`
filename=$path$date"-foo.sql"

/usr/local/bin/mysqldump --opt -Q -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASE > $filename

Thanks guys,

Nope. As well, PostgreSQL is backed by a federation of companies, so
it will be terribly difficult for a competitor to 'buy' all of the
different businesses behind PostgreSQL.

By MySQL taking a sort of "one true company" approach behind the
commercialization of their software, they made it easy for other
companies to target them, leaving them very vulnerable IMHO.

It is this kind of behavior that caused a project I am very familiar
with to embark on a new quest, where anyone and everyone was welcome
to the party...

hi all.

a while back I converted my personal web site into a blog (wordpress)
so I can easily start expressing my self through articles that I think
some people might find helpful. I'm a web developer with lots of
experience in php / databases so most of the articles have been about
web dev (programming / databases stuff).

this morning I was looking at the stats of my site - i get about 10
visitors a day.

so, I've decided that I should start writing on some other site that
gets more exposure where hopefully more people can benefit from my
writings.

The first place that comes to mind is sitepoint which seems to have a
broad coverage of topics and strong reader base.

I was wondering what other sites people would suggest for writing
articles about web dev stuff besides the obvious nyphp.org :) ?

tia,
ophir

Ophir,

The PHP section of the developerWorks open source technology section is 
looking to ramp up its content.  They take articles or tutorials.
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/top-projects/php.html

They have a "wish list" and a link to where to pitch your idea:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wishlist/#opens

Then there's the Zend Developer Zone:

Well, there is certainly some good that can come from publishing your 
work on other sites. In many ways, writing for other sites is part of a 
strategy to build your own reputation etc.

However, if you like to write content and the only problem you are 
having with your own site is a lack of audience (perhaps a lack of 
audience motivating you to write) that can be solved. In my opinion, you 
have alot more to gain by writing on your own site than by writing for 
the majority of the sites that would publish your content today.

As a developer you are well positioned to self-publish and garner an 
audience. In fact, after you do that you may find yourself being invited 
to write for some of the big sites.

ophir:

You can beef-up your visits by producing "free-code". I just finished 
a binary-tree freeware program and pulled in over 1200 hits within 
this last month.

But, it is good for your site (link popularity) to publish at other 
sites as well.

You might consider:  http://www.weberdev.com/

Plus, they have contest -- it makes for an interesting experience.

I guess I am tainted because I know how much money some of those sites 
have made of off  "free" user-submitted content :-)

Maybe, you can sum up all your experience and form them into a good e-book, so that it can be directional in 1 way and it can hit specific audience who are interested in that area. You can then link that e-book from various places like your own web-site, nyphp.org etc.

Thanks

Message-ID: <43FB5560.8000008@cyberxdesigns.com>

I am having trouble with users of a web site.  The site is based on 
Joomla.  When the user logs in, site uses the community builder 
component, he can browse a page or so, then he is redirected to the 
login screen.  The users are in South Africa.  The rest of my users, 
throughout Europe and US, seem to be using the site fine.  I have been 
unable to reproduce the problem locally here in the US.

How would you approach debugging this problem?  I have phone access to 
the user.  I am the administrator of the server so I can configure 
logging however I need to.  I have set up a development site for my 
guinea pig and I can make what ever changes I need to the site to test 
things.

Joomla + Community Builder
RHE + Apache 1.3
Cpanel

Ideas?

Hans

Out of curiousity, is SSL involved? Are you able to have the user try
a different browser?
Have you already gone over a dump of the global vars generated by one
of their requests? Their geographic location could well be a red
herring.

SSL was involved.  I setup the demo site to remove that from the 
equation.  When SSL was involved the user could not even login.  I would 
see a successful login in the logs but then an immediate redirect to the 
logged our state.  Very weird.  Taking SSL out of the equation made 
things better.  Now the user can login and browse 1 or 2 pages.  Then 
redirect to logged out state. 

The user started with IE on Win XP.  I had them install Firefox, same 
problem.  This problem seems to be with multiple users in South Africa.  
Has anyone else seen geographically localized problems with web 
applications like Joomla?

 How would you suggest I capture the global vars generated by one of 
their requests?  Insert some scripting on my side to save them to db or 
log file?  Or output to screen on their end and have them cut and 
paste?  Or is there some better way?

You can capture global var info using trigger_error and print_r:

trigger_error(print_r($_REQUEST, true), E_USER_NOTICE);

If your error reporting and displaying options are set up right, you 
should find a dump of $_REQUEST in your error log. $_REQUEST will tell 
you if the session id was sent.

Hope that helps,

Sounds a lot like cookies/sessions aren't working.  Try either having
them turn on cookies, or set up the php url rewriter.  If they have
cookies on, possibly a proxy server is getting in the way.  You may be
able to find that out from asking them if they know they're using a
proxy or by looking up the PTR records for their source IPs and/or the
user agent in your logs.

HTH,
Andrew

If a proxy is in the way

I once had a problem where a client had their local computer's time  
zone set to someplace in China (the computer was in NY). This caused  
sessions to timeout immediately because the client clock was 13+  
hours a head of the cookie expiration. Now I keep my cookies valid  
for at least 24 hours, as a rough catch all. (Needless to say, that  
bug took a while to track down.)

Not sure if that's the issue, but if it's localized to one machine it  
might be a helpful tip.

I think it is proxy related.  I read the resources Tim turned me onto 
and it was very helpful.  I implemented one of the patches and asked the 
user to retry.  I suspect it is the proxy issue because I can see the 
user switching IPs in the middle of the session.

I will have more information tomorrow after the user tests.

Message-ID: <OFFEB914F2.79E02116-ON8825711D.0003AA81-8825711D.0003ECE9@us.ibm.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to send parameters to a prepared statement using the mysqli 
extension.

The manual shows that it is used like this:
  $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO CountryLanguage VALUES (?, ?, ?, 
?)");
  $stmt->bind_param('sssd', $code, $language, $official, $percent);

Where bind_param can take any number of values like so:
  $stmt->bind_param('s', $foo);
  $stmt->bind_param('si', $foo, $bar);
  $stmt->bind_param('sid', $foo, $bar, $baz); 
 
Unfortunately, I can't be sure of the number of placeholders in the SQL 
statement I am sending, and don't know how many corresponding parameters 
are in an array I pass to my function.  I would like to replicate this 
functionality that I use in the Unified ODBC extension:
  $stmt = odbc_prepare($db, $sql);
  $result = odbc_execute($stmt, $params); 
 
With bind_param it would seem I'd have to construct the bind_param call 
manually and then eval() it to get the same flexibility.  This is what I'd 
like to be able to do:
  $stmt->bind_param($aSeriesOfLettersDependingOnParamsSize, $params);

This would seem like something I'd need to do but haven't been able to 
figure out how to pull it off:
  eval(sprintf('$stmt->bind_param("sss...", %s, %s, %s, ...);') $params);
 
Is there a solution to this that anyone has run into?  Am I overlooking 
something really obvious (anytime eval() comes into play I get that 
feeling...)

TIA,
-Dan

I know that feeling. :)

How about using call_user_func_array()?

Something like:
	array_unshift('sql ? ? ?', $params);
	call_user_func_array(array($stmt, 'bind_param'), $params);

HTH,
Andrew

Here's something I just did along these lines the other day for the Single 
Sign-On module I just contributed to Drupal.  (Note that Drupal's 
db_query() function takes the SQL string as the first parameter and an 
unlimited number of parameter values as subsequent parameters.)

$in   = substr(str_repeat("'%s',", count($sids)), 0, -1);
$sql  = "UPDATE sessions SET uid = %d WHERE sid IN ($in)";
$args = array_merge(array($sql), array($user->uid), $sids);

call_user_func_array('db_query', $args);

For my two cents, I've done something like this using ADODB. 
But maybe you loose the speed benifits by using ADODB instead of a 
straight call.
Does anyone know the difference of using repeated prepared statements 
and a systax where you could have a giant insert statement:

INSERT INTO table(c1,c2)
VALUES (v1.1,v2.1),..., (v1.n,v2.n)

I also found this resource useful:

I have the following system for cross compilation: a computer on which I
build, on which the file system of the target computer is mounted. So, I
do the compile and everything, no problem, pointing to the libraries I
need (I compile with OpenSSL) by their location on the compilation
computer. When I switch to the target computer, the libs are there, but
of course on a different path, and PHP doesn't want to run, pointing to
unable to find the libs. It doesn't help to put them in the PATH. PHP
won't run unless I create for them a PATH exactly like it was on the
compilation computer. 
 
Any idea? There must be a simple way to solve it that I dont't know.
Oh, and, of course,  I don't want to compile with static libraries as
it's a waste of dear space.
 
Thanks.

The problem came down to Joomla and Mambo using the user's IP address 
authenticate users.  When users come from a proxy farm their IP address 
changes mid session and they loose the data that connects them to the 
stored session data and the user is logged out.

I would suggest reading: 
http://www.mambers.com/showthread.php?p=127067#post127067

 From the post:
----------------  snip -------------
The problem, as another poster outlined above, is that Mambo is using 
the users ip address to authenticate sessions ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']), 
and AOL users who use the AOL browser are coming through proxy banks, 
and could potentially have one of up to 128 different ip addresses for 
every separate page request.
----------------- end snip --------

When reading this post just substitute the word proxy farm for AOL.

I have implemented his suggested hack:

--------

|$test = explode('.', $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
unset ($test[3]);
$test = join('.', $test);

------

My users in SA seem to be using the site successfully now.  One major 
problem with this hack is that you have to modify Mambo.php.  I hate 
making changes to the core of an application because now I have to track 
this thing and apply patches into the future manually or reapply my 
patch after the update.

Remember to apply this fix to any of your custom code that relies on 
session data.

I hope this helps, it certainly helped me.

Make sure the path to your libs is in your dynamic linker configuration,
usually found in /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig.  See "man 8
ldconfig" for more info.

Aha, I was right! We switched away from IP reliance in the upcoming
1.0.8 release, as well as the newer 1.1 development release, see Rey's
comments below about the 1.0.x series:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It is addressed in 1.0.8, suggest you tell them to read my blog here:
http://dev.joomla.org/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,33/p,28/

Basically they will have an option to use session id generated from
only first 3 values of IP address instead of full IP, which should
alleviate such problems.  However full IP address (which is more
secure) is the default behaviour.

Note this makes session ids slightly less secure (not checking against
full IP), However the addition of mosConfig_secret and user agent info
will make the generated session id more secure than 1.0.7 and below.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cross-posting as it is relevant info for the Joomla SIG.

Yeah, I can see where IP address checking could be considered a layer
of security "onion" but it only prevents some classes of attack.
Anybody in a position to sniff a session id and use it to create their
own requests is probably also in a position to spoof the IP address on
the packet.

I'm thinking specifically of what might happen if you access your site
using a compromised router, or if someone on your wifi network was
doing packet sniffing.

What are you preventing, then, by checking the IP address? Cross-site
scripting attacks, where the attacker is on another network. That's
pretty big, but you can't assume that all attacks will originate on a
separate network.

If you have written any useful code (and I'm sure you have!) that you
would be willing to "support" as open source, publish it on your site
and create a FreshMeat record for it. That's a little different from
just posting code somewhere, because you retain control over the
content.

Also, don't be afraid of a little self-promotion. Where is the URL in
your signature when you post to this list (and others)? Come on, man!

Maybe it's time to start the member-blog-aggregation service at
rss.nyphp.org...

As you stated earlier in your response, this is just one layer of the
security onion. We've also incorporated quite a few enhancements to
the 1.1 session class. There is no one quick fix to the problem, and
that is why we decided to tackle the challenge with a variety of
approaches.

We just did an internal security audit of 1.0.7, and the upcoming
1.0.8 is the result of that. I've asked several times if any FOSS
security aficionados wanted to participate in a security audit of
Joomla code (even asked back in the Mambo years) but alas, no takers
to date.  (hint, hint)

I'd like an external entity to take a look, as we are too familiar
with our own code, and when you stare at the same thing every day you
manage to stop noticing the cracks and imperfections on your own.

Perhaps your site might get a few more visitors, for
instance from members of this list, if you posted your
message with a signature that includes a link to this
site? I can give you some suggestions, and pointers
to places that may publish your material, but it sure
would be nice to check out some of your existing

I run CodeSnipers ( http://codesnipers.com/ ).  We're a general software 
development site but we have a trio of factions that share ideas, 
information, etc.

The first and probably loudest factions is PHP led by Nola Stowe.  You 
might have seen her articles syndicated to PHPDeveloper and some other 
places.  I think she's planning to go to NYPHP Conf.

The second and most excitable is the Rails crowd led by Caleb Tennis. 
He's an author with the Pragmatic Programmers and one of O'Reilly's Ruby 
bloggers.

Finally, there's everything else...  Gavin Bowman is big in the mISV 
crowd, we have a couple C/C++ people lurking around, there's a bit of 
Perl and Java hiding in there, and I regularly interview people 
throughout the community (Mike Ho of QCodo and Chris Shiflett were in 
the last couple months).

According to Technorati, we're in the top 30k blogs... and we generate a 
fair amount of traffic.  Oh, and it's all built on Drupal with some nice 
modules and custom extensions.  By default, all content on the site is 
treated as "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5".

If you or anyone else is interested in contributing, please feel free.

Keith,

You may want to fix that Drupal installation so that you don't have 
PHPSESSID in the URLs. While it does appear Google is indexing some of 
them (it didn't used to index those at all) there are good reasons for 
the search engines to de-prioritze deep crawling sites with sessids 
because they represent an opportunity for crawl bots to get trapped.

See 
http://www.google.com/search?q=site:codesnipers.com&hl=en&lr=&start=90&sa=N

Only 997 pages indexed, and only 550 or so permited to show as results 
of search queries. Of those 550, only 20 or so have PHPSESSID in the 
URL. Like I said, I do see some indexed, but conventional wisdom is that 
the sessid in the url is holding you back.
 
(the php_trans_sessid and use_cookies settings in php.ini might be 
helpful there).

You may also want to try the pathauto module which IMHO really rocks.If 
you do so on 4.6.x, however, it needs a manual patch (available as a 
diff from the .org site).

Hope that was helpful.

Which now finally has content, including an online
payment/registration system, thanks to a slightly chopped and
repurposed gigCalendar.

JamboWorks, IBM and MicroTek partner to bring professional training to
Joomla developers and content managers, with a very targeted, hands-on
approach geared to get you productive as soon as possible.

I'm personally quite excited about this, as it has been a long time
coming and is in great need. Looking forward to growing the Joomla
community in the NYC area, as well as adding more professional
developers to the Joomla ecosystem!

Message-ID: <AA081BBF5AEED7118ADF00065B3929D90EC51521@ny1post.windows.thettgroup.com>

I have just joined this mailing list, and hope to attend the next meeting on
Tuesday.  I hope this question is not too rudimentary for this group.

Is there a widely-accepted solution to prevent spammers from exploiting the
php mail function (as forwarded from HTML forms, for instance)?  I have seen
several out there, but is there any particular approach that is considered
best?  The less elaborate, the better --I don't really need Pentagon level
security-- but right now there is nothing and the site owners are getting
swamped with spam.

I would appreciate any quick pointers you could offer.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Testing session authentication - multiple apps
Message-ID: <43FDEA68.6090700@email.smith.edu>

Greetings all, apologies if this is a boringly rudimentary question...

I am curious as to one aspect of how sessions work.  Say a user has a 
few different session cookies that have been set by my site from 
different apps.  When they visit one app and I start the session and 
check an identifier such as an authentication variable, how does the 
session mechanism know which session cookie to check? 

Not sure what I'm missing here.  Or perhaps I'm not missing anything and 
I need to uniquely identify each session using session_name() or use 
different session authentication vars in each app (e.g. 
$_SESSION['postcard_auth'] = true; in one, $_SESSION['dbmanage_auth'] = 
true; in another, etc.).

Any info would be helpful.

Thanks,

-Aaron

The best antidote for spam is, first and foremost, a good spam filter
on the email server. Maybe that's not the answer you're looking for,
but it is actually pretty hard to prevent scripts or dedicated humans
from POSTing to a public form on a website.

Aside from filtering messages on the email end, there are some things
you could try to make it harder to spam the form, or not worth the
effort:

1) remove the incentive. Why are people spamming your contact form?
What's in it for them? Do you post the submissions somewhere? Are the
owners a high-value spam target? Can a spammer craft a form submission
so that it gets sent to multiple recipients? Perhaps the form can be
changed to be less of a spam magnet.

2) require a valid HTTP_REFERER on form submission. This is easy for a
spammer to spoof, but they might decide not to bother. Only prevents
scripted abuse.

3) require the poster to decipher a captcha (words encoded as an
image, like Yahoo! uses on registration) Again, there are workarounds
for spammers, but would they bother?

4) Capture the IP address of the poster as part of the submission, and
use php or firewall to block the abusers. This only works if they're
not distributed.

I think a lot of people put up HTML contact forms a few years back
thinking that it would somehow protect them from spam, but it doesn't.

Bingo. session_name() called before session_start() will set the name
of the cookie used by PHP to track the session. If you have different
apps in the same domain name that can't share a session, then you can
give them each a unique cookie name.

Paranoid security note -- each app will be able to see the session ids
that are in use by the other applications, and could pull an "inside
job" to get the values associated with those other sessions, or send
spoofed requests to the other apps. If you want zero information
leakage you need to put the apps on separate domains.

Cool.  Interestingly enough I'm viewing the session cookies set by one 
of my apps and it appears that none of my parameters are being set (e.g. 
session name, expire time, etc.). 

I know this was working previously, but I'm not sure if I've checked 
this out since our server upgraded from PHP4 to PHP5, perhaps there is 
something inherent in the versions or our admins changed some ini 
settings.  I dunno, two steps forward, one step back it seems.  Time for 
more investigation.  Grumble.

Chris,

Thanks so much for your very thorough advice.  

There is no good scripting method or practice, then, that is better to use,
like validation or using include files instead of building the php code into
the form, itself?  (I've heard this could prevent some bots from sniffing
out the mail details.)

It's hard to know exactly what you mean by "exploiting the php mail
function" but Chris made some excellent suggestions.

If it's an issue of you including the email address as a hidden field (or
using "mailto" links anywhere on your site), then, yes that is an easy way
for bots to harvest the addresses. You should never include your email
addresses in a hidden form field, especially if that makes it possible for
someone to easily alter the form and use your server to send out spam. From
what I can tell, however, it sounds like the main problem is your company is
getting too much mail, not that someone is using your form as a relay.

If you are getting flooded with fake form submissions, there are multiple
strategies you can do, some of which were already mentioned, and the best
plan usually involves both client-side as well as server-side solutions.

One thing I might caution about using the HTTP_REFERER method is that many
"privacy" software applications filter this out (as I found out the hard way
on an e-commerce site once) and could prevent legit submissions. Certainly a
mix of cookies, session tracking, ip logging, "captchas", etc. would prevent
submission flooding.

And you can use JavaScript functions to replace "mailto" links to at least
slow down bot email harvesting.

Hans beat me to it. IMHO that article is one of the best on the web for 
addressing multi-part MIME exploits using contact forms. It is an 
advanced topic, though, but as with every "exploit"  if the coder 
suffered through the advanced topics early,  the learning process would 
be much less painful.

Basically it shows how even if you build a "safer" contact form, it may 
be used to insert spam because Internet mail systems permit mail 
messages to be inserted into other mail messages. The bottom line is 
that you have to filter every field of the mail your form will create 
and send, even if you don't collect those fields on your form (default 
fields and the like). Most people are filtering every field their form 
collects (which is not enough... you have to filter/control the defaults 
as well). That article also highlights the need to filter out newlines 
that might indictate an inserted message-within-a-message. It's a good 
article.

Chris' reply is excellent for the way it suggests you review the bigger 
picture of your security (not just the technology of the contact form). 
I completely agree, and would like to add more. Consider these ideas as 
a start:

Can your form be used to spoof an email so that it appears to come from 
someone within your company even though it really originated on your 
website, created by an outsider?

Could I use your form to send an email to the person who handles 
user-submitted requests, perhaps looking like an email from your web 
hosting company directing an update of shell account username/passwords etc?

Can your "change my password" form be used to change another user's 
password withoit prior permission/approval?

Does your contact-us form CC others in your organization prior to any 
adminsitrative review? You don't want obscene or harassing statements 
circulated within the company, or you could open up the company to civil 
liabilities. Similarly, if your organization is regulated (HIPAA, 
banking and finance, securities, etc) un-reviewed user submissions 
should not be circulated (copied to multiple places onclient machines etc).

Hope this helps.

Hi everyone,

I'm more interested in finding out what is causing the widespread 
exploitation of forms. I've written a paper on it (which references the 
NYPHP article), though I have admittedly little information. If anyone 
has anything to contribute, please let me know. I've logged about 80 
attempts at exploiting a form on my server today, and they're 
increasingly from the United States.

Eh, viruses happen. Malware happens. Heck, you could use a cross-site
scripting attack to perform this kind of spamming using Ajax requests.

It doesn't really matter what's causing the attacks, because there
will always be something ready to step up and exploit the scripts
until they get fixed. There are plenty of people out there running old
perl scripts that turn their web servers into open mail relays, at
least most of the PHP contact form handlers I've seen haven't been
quite that naiive.

As I recall, the majority of distributed denial of service (DDOS) 
attacks are now coming from compromised servers (check Netcraft). 
Consider this scenario:

Programming "company" creates website offering a free script to the 
world. Maybe it's a PHP script. Maybe it's a forum, or a directory 
script, or maybe it's a mod to one of those. The site is in a 
less-regulated place with a TLD ending in 2 letters. The coders are 
identified by monikers. The "AboutUs" looks one of those corporate 
templates we all love so much. The forum is full of "awesome dood... I 
need a script like this! But I can't get  it to work!" followed by admin 
responses like "no problem. PM me and I'll help you" and then "thanks 
dude! you rock! It works great!"

What we didn't see was the passing of shell access from user to unknown, 
overseas coder. Even if that didn't happen, is the script full of 
cross-site or other injection opportunities? Sure they are. Free support 
for a free script running on a low-cost shared hosting plan = 
compromised server (or compromisable).

Now after you see one of those blatantly exploitable free scripts 
gaining popularity, go file a report with Secunia or whomever. Unless 
you provide extensive details of the code and exploit potential, they 
won't publish it nor can they afford the time to look into it.

Well, it's true that our signature is perhaps a little busy, but hey, we
have a lot going on.  :)

> New York PHP Community Talk Mailing List

This is mandatory... :)

> New York PHP Conference and Expo 2006
> http://www.nyphpcon.com

So I'm sure most on this list have heard already, but we've launched a
significant PHP/open source/technology event, happening June 14-16, 2006.
We always are pleased to have people involved, whether it be via
sponsorship, speaking, or helping to spread the word.

For speakers, we're reaching out to local companies to learn how they're
using, integrating or even just considering PHP.

To help spread the word, all you need to do is check out the Show
Participation section:

http://www.nyphpcon.com/show_participation.php

We appreciate folks jotting a link or image on their sites, blogs, etc. and
if you'd like to participate as a media sponsor, please contact me offlist.

> Show Your Participation in New York PHP
> http://www.nyphp.org/show_participation.php

And the above link, which is new, gives a way for people to show that
they're involved and helping NYPHP support the open source community.
Again, place a link or image anywhere that's convenient.

If I understand correctly, we have a PHundamentals article available for

I'd like to revive this thread and ask if there are any good FOSS
offline analysis tools available. Say a fat-client app that can chew
up logfiles on a local machine, and that generates (pretty formatted)
reports.

Would be nice to know if something like that exists out there,
especially in the FOSS world...

And AWStats doesn't cut it?

I rsync server logs to a separate box nightly, and then awstats.pl
chews through them and generates its databases. The result is a
relatively pretty, formatted report.

The bonus is that the logs are backed up if the server goes belly-up.
And you only have to maintain one instance of AWStats. This saves a
lot of maintenance when generating stats for multiple hosts, because
each host config can include a global config that has the bulk of the
configuration directives.

We're going to start sponsoring online presentations for those who can't
make it to New York City.  These won't be instead of the monthly meetings,
but in addition to, and we encourage the community to participate.  For
those of you on the NYPHP-Announce list (which everyone should be!) our
first online presentation featuring "Web Attacks and How They Are Stopped By
dotDefender" has just been announced.  There's also a calendar entry:

http://www.nyphp.org/content/calendar/view_entry.php?id=90&date=20060314

We've also opened up a presentation submittal form where everyone is
encouraged to submit or suggest topics.  More details are available at:

http://www.nyphp.org/presentations.php

And no, it's probably not a good idea to add more lines to the signature.

So please check the http://www.nyphp.org frontpage frequently for updates,
and be sure you're subscribed to the NYPHP-Announce
(http://www.nyphp.org/lists) mailing list (announcements are NOT
cross-posted between lists).

This is indeed helpful addition in current way of presentations, mainly for those whow are not able to join presentations over there. By this change non US members can also feel like they are there with them. I wish best luck to this new way of online presentations and looking forward to participate in this presentations.

Pardon my dissent, but that article has flaws.  I've mentioned them before 
on several occasions.  But let's cut to the chase.  The quick, guaranteed 
way to avoid header injection is to pass all email headers through the 
following:

   $value = preg_replace("/[\r\n]+/", "\r\n ", trim($value));

There's a whole thread about this stuff, of which this is one:

I was going to suggest this a while ago - something like a Planet NYPHP.

Without knowing anything else I'd say sign up for google analytics and
wait (there's a waiting list).

Nothing else free comes even close.

If you need something right now - I'd say http://www.statcounter.com/

hmm - just realized this is a very old thread ... oh well.

Message-ID: <000101c63ba5$2e1b6df0$68e4a144@Rubicon>

I see that there are ad hoc free scripts/classes/methods for sending SMS
text messages from a PHP script out to a specific 
telephone company's gateway server...

but I'm wondering if anyone on the list has had a past experience with
setting up a client's website application to 
send and receive SMS text messages.

If so, have you used a vendor with servers that send/receive on your behalf
like: http://www.tm4b.com/

Has anyone used Teleflip http://www.teleflip.com/teleflip/index.jsp
personally or professionally?

Any previous experiences would be of interest.

I've used teleflip personally to send texts now and then and it seems 
to have worked fine to different carriers. But that was just very 
light casual use...

Top of the line is rackspace.com, they do "managed hosting", incredible 
cs, but of course more pricey.

I have a dedicated gentoo server at sevenl.net, and another at 
serverpronto.com.  They are cheaper than rackspace.com and for that I 
get occassional annoyances, miscommunications, and other stuff.  Each of 
the networks has been down for and hour so in the past few months.

Based on these experiences I am intending myself to keep all of my test 
stuff on one of either sevenl.net or serverpronto.com, and move the 
production stuff to rackspace.com.

Not sure about the unlimited plesk key requirement, but I am a happy
user of ServerBeach, which is basically RackSpace wth much, much lower
prices and similar support. Founded by one of the RackSpace guys, you
should feel right at home if you are familiar with their service.

We use 1&1, which has been pretty good thus far.  But I wonder if anyone

Peter,

My biggest customer is an SMS provider and if you're trying to send a 
simple SMS, you can normally do something along the lines of sending an 
email to {phonenumber}@{carrier}.  This will normally work for all free 
efforts across the major carriers but is not technically an SMS.

If you are looking to have true SMS capability - like where a user could 
respond via a shortcode - it gets quite a bit more complicated.  For 
this, you need dedicated connections (called binds) to the various 
carriers along with approval from the carriers so they know where to 
route the shortcode.  And the shortcode must be approved/purchased by 
the shortcode authority (like an IP).

On top of that, there are certain requirements - like supporting STOP, 
HELP, etc - that are involved at the carrier level.  If you're looking 
to do premium services, it gets even more fun.

More than anything, it's simply data down the pipe.  I'm working with 
production systems that do it in Java and PHP, so there are efforts out 
there... not sure what the licensing of the code is, but I think that's 
the least of the barriers.

Alternatively, I've been trying to convince my customer to build an API 
and resell some of the services, so people like you might serve to build 
my case.

If you have more/additional questions, feel free to drop me a note.

Keith

It is currently a huge PITA to obtains shortcodes and provision them  
w/ all the carriers @ the moment (not to mention a monopoly on the  
registry) ...

http://www.usshortcodes.com can get you a CSC for ~$500 per month  
(random) or $1000 for fixed.  And it is the *only* route to go.

For low cost apps, Ive personally used UA ...

http://www.unwiredevents.com/main/app

I normally judge a SMS third-party on their level of integration know- 
how + how quick they reply to emails :-)  Either way easy to setup, I  
just wish doing it all w/ a CSC and trying your luck w/ SMS apps was  
a bit more straight forward ...  Teleflip is also very handy.  But if  
you get serious about it you have to study up on MO (message  
originating) and MT (message terminating) charges to see if its  
worthwhile.

Uses shared hosting technique called Virtual Private Server 
so that you can configure your own Apache and have 
SSH, Cron, optional PHP4.x or PHP 5.x. 
 
Very nice pricing.

I use tektonic.net which also provides VPS hosting. For a cheaper
alternative, they have unmanaged hosting options, where you're 100%
responsible for the server.

Further regarding this topical item of web hosting. Here is some of my two
cents.

Primero. If they don't have 24/7 live tech support. Just say no, skip it,
pass, move on, 
these aren't the droids we're looking for. 

Generally, I have found web hosting plans (*NIX or WIN) priced at less than
$10 per month to be unacceptable,  
plagued with web site outages in prime time business hours and on busy
shopping holidays. 
Email service frequently interrupted. Knowledgeable but inert tech support. 

Plans at $20 - $60 per month seem to offer more performance and uptime
respectability.

Staying our of the nearly vicious bargain basement web hosting arena really
eases the selection task anyway, 
fewer smorgasbord options and clearer path to realistic admin controls. 

I have settled on:

Interland 
I use them for myself and several clients. We never have web site down time
or email interruption.
General website performance: a bit off, but never unacceptable.
FTP xfr rate is always good.
But, admittedly, at the admin interface, response is typically a bit
sluggish, 
especially when using phpMyAdmin for MySQL admin.

Westhost 
I have a client using them. 
General website performance: nice.
FTP xfr rate is excellent
Admin interface response is very crisp.

Verizon Business-class
(A techie there told me that they actually subcontract to Interland.) 
I have one client using them.
General website performance: nice.
FTP xfr rate excellent.
Admin interface is snappy.

There that is my two cents. 

There really are no bargains and I think it works better in client meetings
when one calmly suggests 
a little focused business-class web hosting up tweak instead of getting out
the 9-panel Italian menu 
of diversionary options.

Peter

Uses shared hosting technique called Virtual Private Server 
so that you can configure your own Apache and have 
SSH, Cron, optional PHP4.x or PHP 5.x. 

Very nice pricing.

Sorry, but one last caveat on this here web hosting.
 
Domain Names and Web Hosting
 
I don't let the web host provide the domain name service. 
I make the client actually buy it themselves, separately, from another
vendor like Network Solutions.
(Yes, this costs more.) But...
 
Then later if there are any irresolvable technical issues with the web host,
you can: 
1) Go and buy a new web hosting plan by IP address only, 
2) Set up the web site at the new host,
3) Log in to your separate domain name control panel and change the domain
name pointing yourself to the new web host,
4) End of nightmare old web hosting story. 
 
This way the client is in control of their own domain name destiny and can
be 
a discriminating consumer with playable options and can move around more at
will.
 
Giddy.

Good point. I've been doing this for a while, especially as needs change for
hosting solutions.

Yeah, changing registrars later is a pain.

Well... considering that everyone else is offering their two cents -- 
I'm definitely at the lower end of cost -- I can't afford the 
expensive stuff. As such, I get hosting for $6.95 per YEAR and it's 
sufficient for all my php development needs. No complaints yet.

Contact me off-list if interested.

Yeah, I had one client who did that and then every year 
like-clock-work his site would go down and then after blaming me for 
it, I would find that he had failed to reregister his domain. It 
happened four years in a row and I finally told him to go elsewhere.

Now, any web sites that I manage completely, I also handle all the 
domain name stuff and bill for it. If the client wants to go 
elsewhere, it's no problem to release the name to another register.

These are two alternative strategies and I definitely understand and respect
both models.

But I don't want the domain name or web hosting responsibility.
To be blunt, because I don't want the client calling me on Saturday
afternoon about 
"why is the web site slow" or email is down. 

Especially, if they have selected some 20-cent web hosting with 
automated avatar language-sensitive FAQ-driven IM chat tech support with
emoticons.

Essentially, Samsung builds almost all flat panel television screens,
regardless of whose brand name in on the box.
 
In web hosting I believe that essentially there is a handful of really big
hosts behind the scenes and many, many of the little 
guys are resellers for the big guys. They even get hooked to the big guys
tech support through well-devised intelligent 
800 number routing.
 
I'd enjoy seeing a schematic of webhosting ownership from the big true "we
physically own and control the servers" 
entities with connectors down to all the resellers they support.
