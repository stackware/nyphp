Cleverly sending data during the blank interval, Teletext is great. They 
had a similar thing here but it never caught on. Seems its cheaper to have 
500 channels for info than using something like Teletext perhaps? Or maybe 
the not-invented-here symdrome kicked in...

Sure, but I could also argue a lot of important inventions weren't 
invented here (radar, jet engines, web browsers, etc), but I think a lot 
of American either dont know or forget.

</I>
There are a lot of other forces at play here. Verizon for years had to 
share and the cable companies did not. So there's no incentive for Verizon 
to improve facilties. Now that they dont *have* to share their network, 
they can just sit back and wait for the fiber rollout (effectively locking 
out any competition from anyone else). Ive seen whole building where the 
copper has been replaced by fiber. So noone else can sell services into 
that building. Pretty neat strategy.

I had a friend who signed up for Verizon FiOS TV. They showed up and 
replaced ALL of his copper with fiber, including his phone. Unfortunately, 
he has DSL on the phoneline so he lost Internet access - took them two 
weeks to 'fix' it.

Why do I know a lot about this crap? Well, I used to work for a local ISP 
- we've seen all the BS, tricks and games from Verizon...

Without competition, be prepared for things to be crappy for a long long 
time.
