<PRE>I tend to see good reason for doing exactly this,

It can allow your development lifecycle to be enhanced

 

I personally have two system cores that I use for clients who aren&#8217;t using
our proprietary tech, Joomla (with a few mods that I&#8217;m working on a document
to describe which will be placed on my personal site soon) and Drupal
(either my own breed - or acquia if enterprise level).

 

Doing this has allowed me to lower prices for clients without losing out on
the needed income levels. Primarily I find that having a detailed setup plan
in writing for the core and module configs makes life very simple. One of
the key reasons is I&#8217;ve invested in memberships for a few theme template
sites, a ton of different modules such that I can install a site quickly to
meet nearly any need. Need content versioning, multiple roles, non-profit
group tracking (donations, groups, mailing lists, tracking), event
management. But most of all I personally like the ability for smaller
clients to self update sites without needing a huge degree of
&#8220;html/css/etc&#8230;&#8221; know-how. I&#8217;ve given local restaurants the ability to update
sites that they normally would have to have someone else update - taking the
delay out of the potential issues caused by a client sending an email or
phone dictation, and giving you time to work with newer clients or just
simply to get a larger clientele.

 

So in short yeah - I would strongly suggest this.

 

(my last and more internal reason is simply that if for some reason we&#8217;re to
disappear off the planet my client could still run their own site without my
existence)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP, Joomla, SEO

 

As it turns out, I have ended up specializing in helping businesses greatly
improve their 

presence on the web with a modern, well-designed website that really speaks
well for 

the business entity. My new sites will freshly amplify the best aspects of
the business entity 

and often revitalizes how the staff, clients and vendors view the business. 

This site, though, does or does not need to be dynamic PHP. 

 

Joomla In Every Job 

But I am considering initiating a plan to build all my website projects on
top of Joomla 

even if the client has only a few or no dynamic PHP needs. But this will
allow me to 

introduce the most common dynamic PHP tools at any time if needed.

 

Does anyone have any thoughts on such a move? Is it worth the hassle of
customizing a CMS like 

Joomla even if I may not be using the structure right now? 

 

Extra Note:

 

Joomla A User's Guide by Barrie M. North. 

I wish to point out that the SEO section Ch. 8 in this book is one of the
best info-filled fastest reads 

that acts as a strong fairly techie intro to practical, on the web page SEO
concepts. Once a coder /designer digests 

the technical details discussed here it would potentially allow a
coder/designer to design and write some good 

SEO technique into a web job right from scratch.

 

Warmest regards,
