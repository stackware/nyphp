<PRE>Mitch,

I do believe that when you start service with a company such as the  
electric or cable, etc. they have right of passage to the phone polls  
at anytime.  I recall reading about this online a while back when one  
got caught in a womans back yard and she threw a fit.  However it  
stated they were not at fault and had all rights to access the utility  
equipment.  I'm sure this would not work at 3am or anything unless  
there was an emergency but you get the idea.
