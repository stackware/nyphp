I usually set up a custom error handler to report internal problems via 
a back-channel (email, http to a tracking server, etc), and use 
Exceptions or other error reporting methods (PEAR_Error, etc) for 
returning error information destined for the user.

A pseudo-code example:

function do_something()
{
   // do something in the database
   $result = db_query(&lt;some sql&gt;);

   // if the query fails
   if (!$result) {
     // report the technical details via back channel
     trigger_error(db_error_details());

     // return a descriptive error to the user
     throw new Exception('Couldn't do something, contact support');
   }

   // use $result to do something

   return true
}

Of course there are innumerable ways to skin a cat, but this approach 
has worked out ok for me, and it means that I get back-channel 
notifications for all errors (php notices, etc).

&gt;<i> Most of my confusion comes from the fact that the way both Exceptions
</I>&gt;<i> and Errors are handled and generated in PHP has changed over the years,
</I>&gt;<i> with each one being used at times incorrectly because the other did not
</I>&gt;<i> have all the functionality needed for particular usages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, to review what my understanding is as of PHP 5.3:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When an error is generated in PHP, there are a number of pre-defined
</I>&gt;<i> types of errors:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are especially useful for programmers is differentiating between:
</I>&gt;<i> Depreciated, Notice, Warning,&amp;  Error.
</I>
Firstly, <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation</A>

&gt;<i> As of PHP 5.3 all of the above error levels have both a PHP error level
</I>&gt;<i> and a &quot;user&quot; error level.  An example of the difference between them
</I>&gt;<i> could be that when running a program that utilizes a PHP framework, if
</I>&gt;<i> at some point in the code there is a call to the split() function - the
</I>&gt;<i> program will execute correctly, however a depreciated error will be
</I>&gt;<i> generated and if such errors are logged, periodic review of logfiles
</I>&gt;<i> will give programmers a heads up that they have to recode part of the
</I>&gt;<i> program.   Wheras if that framework defines it's own internal functions,
</I>&gt;<i> and one function is slated to be removed, good programming practice
</I>&gt;<i> would be for the framework authors to generate a user_depreciated error
</I>&gt;<i> notice - which can be used in the same manner to update code using that
</I>&gt;<i> framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When user errors are generated in PHP, the program may or may not abort
</I>&gt;<i> when the error is generated.  It may or may not log the error message to
</I>&gt;<i> a file or some other method.  All of this depends primarily on how the
</I>&gt;<i> PHP instance is configured.
</I>
Yes, though by setting a custom error handler you can take control of 
almost all of the errors (those excluded are listed here 
<A HREF="http://us3.php.net/set_error_handler">http://us3.php.net/set_error_handler</A>) and process them however you see fit.

&gt;<i> This makes user errors great for providing information about potential
</I>&gt;<i> problems with the code when you are not sure whether or not the error
</I>&gt;<i> should result in the program aborting or just noting a transitory problem.
</I>
Yes, except that it is a pretty blunt instrument.  You can either return 
to the program flow where it left off, or completely exit.

&gt;<i> Exceptions can do most of the things user errors are used for, but one
</I>&gt;<i> thing they cannot do is continue executing from the point of the
</I>&gt;<i> exception being thrown.  Once thrown, the block of code being executed
</I>&gt;<i> is aborted and the path of coding goes to the exception handler
</I>&gt;<i> instead.   This could be used to generate an error message of some sort,
</I>&gt;<i> log a problem, etc.
</I>
Not entirely true, but the code needs to be aware and have provisions to 
catch the Exception, whereupon it can take whatever action is necessary.

&gt;<i> As an example, consider a web page where we have a common header, a
</I>&gt;<i> common footer, and then the main section of the web page.  For a
</I>&gt;<i> particular url, the data being displayed in the main section is
</I>&gt;<i> restricted to authorized individuals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Error handling: the page can be completely generated by one function.
</I>&gt;<i> First the header is sent, then the authorization for the main section is
</I>&gt;<i> checked - if it fails, an error can be generated and an unauthorized
</I>&gt;<i> message generated for display, if it succeeds the data can be generated
</I>&gt;<i> - then the footer is sent.  The user of the application can decide that
</I>&gt;<i> they want to do something different[lock the account, abort handling,
</I>&gt;<i> call the cops] by creating their own error handler function and calling
</I>&gt;<i> it before they call the third party code.
</I>
Typically you'd want to do at least the access checks before you output 
anything to the client.

&gt;<i> Exception handling: The code needs to be much more object oriented.  For
</I>&gt;<i> the main body of code, you might have an object where you call a
</I>&gt;<i> generate header, generate content, and generate footer method.  In the
</I>&gt;<i> generate content method, you would have to have a try block around the
</I>&gt;<i> authorization check and content generation, and if authorization fails
</I>&gt;<i> throw an exception.  You would also need to catch the exception and in
</I>&gt;<i> the exception handling generate the error message to display for the user.
</I>
If you want to duplicate the same behavior as a custom error handler you 
can implement a custom exception handler 
(<A HREF="http://php.net/set_exception_handler">http://php.net/set_exception_handler</A>) and perform the same sort of 
logic as in a custom error handler, with the advantage that code can 
trap and handle its own exceptions, only unhandled exceptions will 
bubble up to your handler.

&gt;<i> Here it can be much harder to override the default manner in which the
</I>&gt;<i> exception is handled and add your own method.
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> So what I'm curious regarding is how are these 2 methods used in
</I>&gt;<i> practice today, as opposed to theory.  Especially when considering the
</I>&gt;<i> use of frameworks where you don't expect a single team of programmers to
</I>&gt;<i> be writing all the code -but rather you are building on an existing
</I>&gt;<i> framework which can generate it's own errors and exceptions.
</I>
To my way of thinking these 2 systems are complementary, and as outlined 
above typically use them side-by-side for different purposes: 
trigger_error &amp; php-generated errors for development/debugging and 
exceptions or other error return mechanisms for communicating errors 
back to the calling code and eventually to the client.
