<PRE>I've been curious about HHVM but haven't had time to play with it yet.

Thanks for sharing your experiences around Travis CI and HHVM, very helpful.

&gt;<i>  I recently learned about Travis CI[in the past 6 months] which removed a
</I>&gt;<i> large number of testing issues I've faced in the past[PHPUnit has changed
</I>&gt;<i> so much from version to version, that at times one PHP package's tests
</I>&gt;<i> require a specific downlevel PHPUnit to run, while another required a
</I>&gt;<i> different downlevel PHPUnit...leading me to frustration when working on
</I>&gt;<i> both at the same time!]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the combination of Composer, Github, and Travis CI - I can set it up

</I>&gt;<i> Travis runs the tests for me....much easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So when Travis CI added support for selecting HHVM as a PHP Version I was
</I>&gt;<i> curious on how it compared to regular PHP.   Grabbing my favorite PHP
</I>&gt;<i> framework[Joomla] I created a new branch and added hhvm as a PHP version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest problem I ran into was that the current hhvm release is very
</I>&gt;<i> downlevel on features which caused a lot problems in the unit tests[a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of Image processing tests blew up].    Fortunately, Facebook maintains an
</I>&gt;<i> apt installable copy of hhvm-nightly, so with some extra build scripts I
</I>&gt;<i> was able to set up some conditional apt-get scripts to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> hhvm-nightly is installed:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/garyamort/joomla-framework/tree/hvmmaster/build/travis/scripts">https://github.com/garyamort/joomla-framework/tree/hvmmaster/build/travis/scripts</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also had to heavily modify the travis configuration:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/garyamort/joomla-framework/blob/hvmmaster/.travis.yml">https://github.com/garyamort/joomla-framework/blob/hvmmaster/.travis.yml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I learned that with travis, many of the commands for each
</I>&gt;<i> stage[before_install, install, before_script, and script] are at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time.   So if your running 3 scripts for the &quot;install&quot; stage, they run at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time, but if/when one of them fails the error is reported as being
</I>&gt;<i> from the script started first and still running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IE: your running a.sh, b.sh, and c.sh
</I>&gt;<i> a.sh finishes executing
</I>&gt;<i> b.sh and c.sh are still running
</I>&gt;<i> c.sh aborts with a vague error message
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Travis reports the error message as coming from b.sh and aborts the job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus if c.sh depends on something b.sh is configuring, it will fail.  So
</I>&gt;<i> careful placement of scripts to ensure that they finish in the correct
</I>&gt;<i> sequence is important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There were a few interoperability problems between Composer and
</I>&gt;<i> hhvm-nightly when it came to how the version string was formatted - I
</I>&gt;<i> reported it to both groups and the facebook team were very quick about
</I>&gt;<i> reaching out to the Composer dev to find out what version string format he
</I>&gt;<i> preferred and then they updated their build process to produce it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all the major issues taken care of, it was just a process of fixing a
</I>&gt;<i> handful of little incompatibilities to get the test to run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, I found it rather impressive that hhvm took about half the
</I>&gt;<i> time to execute.  Generally it took PHP almost 6 minutes to run all the
</I>&gt;<i> unit tests.  HHVM was able to run them in under 3 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if you don't plan on using hhvm for production - adding it to your
</I>&gt;<i> unit testing is very beneficial.  Most of the changes I had to make in
</I>&gt;<i> order to get the unit tests to run were not differing published
</I>&gt;<i> features[the string access as an array thing for example] - but instead
</I>&gt;<i> they were broken/undocumented features in PHP 5.3/5.4.   For example, PHP
</I>&gt;<i> has some VERY strange ways of handling using private methods for
</I>&gt;<i> autoloaders.   Because the documented autoload features specify that you
</I>&gt;<i> must use public methods for autoloaders, HHVM adhered to the spec and thus
</I>&gt;<i> would break there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's somewhat like how you can use Clang to compile your C code to find
</I>&gt;<i> all the bad coding practices which directly contradict the C standards but
</I>&gt;<i> work anyway if you compile your code with GCC.  Clang has added a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> flags to allow code to be compiled in the &quot;broken&quot; gcc supported way - but
</I>&gt;<i> if you use it in it's default config you can find all your &quot;broken but
</I>&gt;<i> working&quot; code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just curious if anyone has anything actually in production using hhvm?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> even just playing around with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
