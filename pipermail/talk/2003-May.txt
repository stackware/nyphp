Subject: removing and copying files with wildcards on free bsd
Message-ID: <00bd01c31841$60c57500$122c0242@default>

Is there a way in free bsd to rename or copy a whole group of files using
wildcards. For instance, i've been trying

mv *.htm *.php

or

mv sld???.htm sld???.php

but have been unable to do it in free bsd. I know it works in dos.

Message-ID: <1949.172.131.208.245.1051800090.squirrel@www.myhostingadmin.com>

Oregon and Texas state legislatures have bills that may support the
Pro-Open Source cause. California's proposal is really anti-proprietary.
New York had a public hearing on the issue this week.

Here's the debate.

For government IT bids...

Pro-Open Source proponents argue that public institutions should be forced
to look at all bid options (open source and proprietary) and explain their
decisions because they are run off public dollars and for that reason a
different standard should be held for public versus private IT contracts.

Pro-Private proponents argue this is an issue of competition that should
be the same as it is in the private sector and that, at least according to
Microsoft, the total cost of ownership of open source implementation is
not necessarily less expensive than proprietary implementation.

Um, (unless I'm missing something) the methods below both produce
machine-readable email addresses.  SpamBots are as capable as browsers
at executing JavaScript and then interpreting the results.

The neatest trick I've heard about had to do with a mouseover handler
that changed the href of an <a> tag on the fly.  I haven't tried it,
and am wondering if the same can be done for a screenshot image
depicting the address.

I am not sure of a good client-side solution to masking emails; what I had
to do for my site (http://valsignalandet.com) is to build an entire
server-side feedback solution; something becoming popular now with many
sites.  That way my email address is neither listed nor generated; it only
exists within server-side code.

Perhaps a bit heavy-handed but it has significantly cut down on spam that
way.

I'm a fan of the form, with server-side email, myself.

But should the need arise (having one's email address on an on-line resume 
being the only justified reason I can think of), I would recommend 
Hiveware's (free) Enkoder:

There is also a Mac OS X desktop app for the job as well:

Hello Listfolk,

This is going to be a bit of a ramble...

Firstly, here's a pretty simple obfuscator:

/////////////////////////////////////////////
// See it at: http://www.jenniferdalton.com/encoder.php
function obfuscate($s,$type="html") {
	for($i=0; $i < strlen($s); $i++) {
		$encoded  = sprintf("%02s",dechex(ord($s{$i})));
		$hexscii .= '%'.$encoded;
		$hexents .= '&#x'.$encoded.';';
	}
	return ($type=="html"?$hexents:$hexscii);
}
/////////////////////////////////////////////




Now, here's another technique with a little problem; maybe someone has a
suggestion for fixing it....

Contents of z.html:
/////////////////////////////////////////////
<html>
<head><title>Mailer</title></head>
<body>
<a href="z.php">Mail me!</a>
</body>
</html>
/////////////////////////////////////////////

contents of z.php:
/////////////////////////////////////////////
<?php
header("Location: mailto:bogo at netscape.com");
?>
/////////////////////////////////////////////

See this pair at: http://www.jenniferdalton.com/z.html

The problem being that the window in which mailme.html was residing (the
opener) gets kinda fubar ("fubar", tech. jargon - See RFC - 3032 :
http://www.zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC3092/Output/index.html )

I tried a target="_blank" but you now get an intermediate fubar window.

Suggestions?


/////////////////////////////////////////////
The cdt.org report that Hans points to
(http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml) seems to suggest
that this character entity encoding is actually quite effective against
spambots. Can this be true? I would think that this html entity strategy
would be pretty easy to identify and defeat... Has anyone on the list
written a smart spambot? C'mon, 'fess up!

/////////////////////////////////////////////
Ok, one more ramble: spamgourmet kicks a**! nice disposable email addys,
that one can create on the fly... http://www.spamgourmet.com

This is slightly off-topic but...in light of the discussion...I thought
I'd raise the issue. I'm interested in hearing other peoples views.

This morning I received a phone call from one of my clients who "might"
be considered a spammer. He's a headhunter who sends out job offers to a
very select group of people (about 10,000 people worldwide). All his job
offers are legitimate (he's been doing this since the early days of
email and has placed people in some very high-paying positions around
the globe). He does *not* hide who he is; he does *not* use a
non-existent email account; he does *not* use a non-existent web
address. Since his is *not* an opt-in list...as soon as someone says
"Remove Me" he removes them from his list. However...now he's getting
worried. When he sends emails to potential candidates that have an MSN
address...the emails get bounced back.

Again, let me emphasize that all his job offers are legitimate. They can
be viewed at his website (he hides the name of the employer and salary
range since...as a headhunter...he doesn't want anyone doing an end run
around him. However...he also has "entry-level" jobs for students and
does not make any money on those...he offers them as a "service" to the
industry).

The point is that my client is panicking. He's worried he'll be put out
of business now that AOL, MSN, et al., are talking about ways to deal
with spam.

I'm interested to hear what others may think about this particular
situation.

Jeff

Jeff,

My definition of "spam" is unsolicited commercial email.  Thus, I
would consider your friend to be a spammer.  (I'm sure he's a very
nice spammer, but a spammer nonetheless.)

The tactics that you mention in your "he does not ..." list are not
a part of my definition of "spamming"; they are part of my definition
of "dishonest, obnoxious, stupid, arrogant spamming."

Regards,

  Ed

As cold and uncaring as it sounds, if stopping someone from sending
unsolicited e-mail is going to kill their business than they need to find
another way to do their business, or lose their business.

Spam is unsolicited e-mail.  It doesn't matter weather you think you have a
legitimate reason to send Spam, it's still spam.  I'm against Spam,
unsolicited sales calls on the phone, unsolicited faxes, junk mail and all
such things.  We get commercials on TV which I have never minded, because
it's how TV gets it's money while I get TV for free.  There are adverts in
newspapers and magazines because this either pays for the rag, or helps to
keep the subscription price down to a reasonable price.  Mail is not free,
the price of mail continues to go up as the post office is struggling under
the increased load of mail where mail routes need to be made shorter and
more delivery people added.  Fax is not free, I have to pay for the paper
and ink and if its a business line I have to pay for the message units used
to receive the fax.  E-mail is not free, I have to pay a provider for it, or
buy the equipment and pay a provider to hook up to the net.

What's even worse about spam is how it's in your face.  I have kids who are
receiving spam for all kinds of perverse crap.  I don't get perverse crap in
the mail ( and even if i did, it would be in an envelop where I can choose
to throw it out before I even see the perversity ), I don't get calls from
phone sex people trying to get my business, but yet I get totally offensive
garbage in my e-mail.

I have no sympathy for anyone who uses unsolicited means to sell their
product or service.  There are enough places to advertise right now in TV,
Radio, Newspapers, Magazines, and Internet web sites.

Ed,

I agree with you but up to a point. Is all unsolicited commercial email
necessarily spam?

Nearly all the spam I've received has come from spammers who go to great
lengths to hide their true identity. You go to the website referred to
in their email and there is nothing there. When there *is* a website,
they offer no contact information other than a form-to-mail page.

So is there a difference between the spammer who hides who he is and the
spammer who is upfront and honest about who he is? I, for one, am not
sure what the right answer is to this question. (And believe me...I am
as plagued by spam as everyone else...I average 100 UCEs per day.)

Jim,

It's my kids that I worry most about...at least where spam is
concerned...so we are definitely in agreement there.

One part of me agrees that spam is spam no matter what level of
"honesty" may be behind it (in the case of my client). The other part of
me is concerned about my client.

Jeff,

I'm not totally uncaring about your client, just pointing out that we live
in a changing world, and as a business owner myself I understand if I am not
able to change with the times, I don't deserve to be in business.  What your
client is doing may have been acceptable when spam was at the level of junk
mail where every now and then I receive an e-mail about legitimate business
that is sensitive enough to recognize that there are moral limits as to the
content of the e-mail because there may be minors viewing the e-mail.  But
if we make exceptions as to what e-mails are acceptable spam then the
spammers will figure out how to justify that their crap meets the
exceptions.

Your client needs to spend time investigating the other options available to
him rather than bewail the fact that the spammers have ruined for him a good
means of rapping out some business.  He needs to look at the job services
like dice where he can register as a head hunter and receive information
about people looking for jobs that are soliciting his type of e-mails.  He
needs to look at getting his own site advertised well enough that job
applicants would come to his site and enroll for his e-mails.  To act as if
the world is over because a means of marketing is going away is like crying
the sky is falling!

Jim

Yes, it's spam.  Spam is unsolicited commercial email.  That's the plain,
simple definition.

You seem to think that calling it "spam" means that it's dirty, rotten,
and evil.  Perhaps we'd do better trying to discuss whether there is or
is not an acceptable form of spam.

I think any unsolicited commercial email is offensive.  I also think
it should be illegal for spammers to use the dishonest tactics to
which you refer.  But these are two separate issues.  And many good
people would disagree with my position on either.

Regards,

  Ed

Jim,

Very, very well stated. I've been preparing a "speech" similar to your
second paragraph in anticipation of my client's follow-up phone call. 

I also think that you are correct to point out about the "moral limits"
of the email content and that is the bigger issue.

Ed,

I think Jim raised an important point in his email concerning the "moral
limits" of email content. I don't consider unsolicited catalogs via
snail mail to be offensive though, when the Frederick's of Hollywood
catalog shows up (I swear! I NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING FROM THEM!) that's
when I get angry.

And so while I get annoyed when I'm asked, for the umpteenth time, to
get Gevalia coffee, I get very angry when I receive pornographic
material.

I'm gonna get flamed by the text-only and accessibility camps for this, 
but another very effective way to advertise your email address without 
having it picked up by spambots is to use an image instead. I have a PHP

He has every right to panic because they're not just talking.  In the case 
of AOL, they're already doing.  I've forgotten the formula I saw a couple 
of weeks ago but if you send X emails to non-existent/expired AOL accounts 
in X days, you're automatically blackholed.  Worse, your mail will just 
disappear into the bit bucket without a bounce.

I know what the "official" definition is, but I don't think spam is 
unsolicited commercial email.  It's unsolicited, unwanted bulk email.  It's 
a lot like pornography: you know it when you see it.  If I was out of work, 
living on ramen and water, and I landed a job because I was on that 
headhunter's list, I'd have a very different opinion of those mailings than 
someone who was happily employed at 3x the salary offered.

I've gotten lots of spam that wasn't commercial, like chain letters 
demanding that I send a bunch of copies to my annoyed friends, political 
demands that I Bitch To Bush and the "prayer for the day" crap I used to 
get a couple of years ago.  Virus email is probably the most evil form of 
spam even though there's rarely a commercial purpose to it.  By the same 
token, the service advisories that Watchguard sends its customers and which 
I never opted into are both bulk and commercial, yet they contain 
information that I want.

Your friend is probably going to have to make some adjustments.  Sending a 
single job description out to 10,000 people is excessive.  I think he might 
want to trickle out some "re-opt" emails to his subscribers and in the 
future send email only to those who respond affirmatively.

Steve,

"I think he might want to trickle out some "re-opt" emails to his
subscribers and in the 
future send email only to those who respond affirmatively."

I believe this is the way to go. 

And I should clarify one small point. He doesn't send the same job
description to 10,000 people. He sends different job descriptions to
different people based on their "specialty" areas.

As was noted in another email...my client is going to have to rethink
how he does business.

Message-ID: <BAD74E6B.B146%jfreeman@amnh.org>

I have a page with PHP doing the following things so far:

1) if NOT submitting, then display a form.

2) if submitting, echo the contents of the submission and insert into the
values into a database.

The insert statement is working just fine.

I'm having some problems with the echoing of the contents to the page.


Here is the echo statement I'm using to echo the inserted values:

----------snip------------

while (list($name, $value) = each($HTTP_POST_VARS)) {

    echo "$name = $value<br>.\
";

----------snip------------


problem number one is:  I forgot how to do that using 'foreach' instead of
while()  each()...

problem number two is: because of contents of $HTTP_POST_VARS, "submit =
submit " is coming up as a result of the

echo "$name = $value<br>.\
"

statement.

In other words, in addition to showing the submitter the values of his/her
submission, s/he's also seeing that 'submit=submit' is a value too...


The next problem is that I need to take the submitted name/value pairs and
format and send an email with them to one email address... I have no idea
how do that though I know it involves $HTTP_POST_VARS again...

I want to do this all on one page.

Any help/pointers appreciated!

Thanks!

Joshua

try:
foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: $key; Value: $value<br>\
";
}

before your foreach:
unset ($HTTP_POST_VARS['submit']);
this will pull it out of the array

change the foreach statement above to:
foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: $key; Value: $value<br>\
";
    $message .= "Key: $key; Value: $value<br>\
";
}

and then use the mail function, something like:
mail($contactemail, $subject, $message, $headers);
to send the values.

Hello,

I need your expert help please. Can someone tell me more information about
this warning?  If the pass-by-reference is going away, then how do I change
the value of multiple variables through a function?

Thank you so much for your help.

Pinyo

Warning: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated - argument passed
by value; If you would like to pass it by reference, modify the declaration
of [runtime function name](). If you would like to enable call-time
pass-by-reference, you can set allow_call_time_pass_reference to true in
your INI file. However, future versions may not support this any longer. in

You'll probably want to dump the POST variables into a different array
before you unset. Try:

$arr = array();
$arr = $HTTP_POST_VARS;       // or is it $arr[] = $HTTP_POST_VARS;
unset($arr['submit']);
foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {
 echo "Key: $key; Value: $value<br>\
";
 $message .= $key ." = ". $value ."<br>\
";
}

Good luck!

Please note that there is no reason to declare $arr as an array (and create
new array). $arr = $_POST  copies the $_POST array to the new variable $arr.

J.,

	Don't forget that if you're outputting your results
to a web (HTML) page, you need to run htmlspecialchars() on
them so that any HTML entities will appear properly:

foreach ( $arr as $key => $value ) {
	$key = htmlspecialchars ( $key );
	$value = htmlspecialchars ( $value );
	echo "Key: $key; Value: $value<BR>\
";
}


	As a shortcut, if you know your "keys" are all already
safe for HTML, you can skip the htmlspecialchars() for each $key,
and just escape the "values."  (But often you never *really* know;
someone could easily spoof your form and repost their own key/value
pairs.)

	A lot of web applications neglect this HTML escaping
issue, which causes problems, including security risks!  Example:
the user could type a <SCRIPT> block into one of the input fields,
which, when you echo it back un-escaped, would cause it to execute
under the authority of *your* webserver's domain!

	In general, unless you know that your text data is valid
(and safe!) HTML, you almost (?) always should run htmlspecialchars()
on it before sending it to a web browser.  In addition, you might
also want to use nl2br() to add appropriate line breaks.

	Regarding Greg's post:

$arr = $HTTP_POST_VARS;    // or is it $arr[] = $HTTP_POST_VARS;

the comment is not correct.  $array = $other_array is correct.
Plus, with PHP > 4.1.0, $_POST works better than $HTTP_POST_VARS,
which is deprecated.  Also, you can modify the built-in $_POST
array just fine, in my experience; no need to copy it to modify it.


Best, George.

Hi Pinyo,

You would want to have your '&' in the function definition and not the
function call.
Example:
function foo(&$var) {
    ++$var;
}
$bar=1;
foo ($bar);

($bar is now 2)

Daniel, 


Here's the code that generates the multi-select box. What I'm wondering
is how to get the 'selected' to show up when the user has posted (the
form posts to itself and I want to retain the values in the form). I'm
assuming I have to do something like looping through the array for
DL_mCategories since the user can select multiple items.

<td><select name="DL_mCategories[]" size="6" multiple
id="DL_mCategories">
 <?php
	do {  
	?>
	<option value="<?php echo $row_Search_Cats['DS_ID']?>"><?php
echo $row_Search_Cats['DS_sCatDescrip']?></option>
		<?php
			} while ($row_Search_Cats =
mysql_fetch_assoc($Search_Cats));
			$rows = mysql_num_rows($Search_Cats);
			if($rows > 0) {
			mysql_data_seek($Search_Cats, 0);
			$row_Search_Cats =
mysql_fetch_assoc($Search_Cats);
			}
		?>
	</select></td>

Since a multi-select can contain multiple values, you need to use a 
variable that can hold multiple values. If you add brakcets [] to your 
field name for the multi-select, then the values will be contained in 
an array by that name.

<select name="varName[]" multiple size=5>

I've found that the best solution is to use an HTML form w/ a server-side
script to send a message.
Unless it's absolutely necessary for you to distribute your e-mail address,
then why not direct them to your site's contact form?

The other thing you could do is publish it as an image, although you may
have to use a stenciled, wavy style to prevent OCR bots from interpreting
it.
When they click the image, have it open an HTML mail form, rather than using
mailto: to instantiate a mail client.

Um, (unless I'm missing something) the methods below both produce
machine-readable email addresses.  SpamBots are as capable as browsers
at executing JavaScript and then interpreting the results.

The neatest trick I've heard about had to do with a mouseover handler
that changed the href of an <a> tag on the fly.  I haven't tried it,
and am wondering if the same can be done for a screenshot image
depicting the address.

There are a number of solutions out there for parsing and displaying RSS 
data using PHP -- look in the PEAR classes, there's also Fase 4's 
excellent RDF class at http://www.fase4.com/rdf/

If you want more of a turn-key, right-now solution, take a look at 
Feedsplitter -- a project of mine that parses the RSS and renders it 
using any number of server-side templates-- including javascript 
templates so that you can include the output in a static webpage using a 
<script> tag. It may need a little work, please feel free to email me if 
want to install it on your own server:

Happy parsing!

Hi Pinyo,

I can recommend very highly the PEAR RSS parser at 
http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=22.  It's a snap to use and 
I've had great results.

I use it on my website, http://www.gadhra.com, to get RSS feeds from 
some sites I like.  Here's how I use it:

<?php
   /*  Here's a little function to iterate through the channel array  */
    function parse_feed($arr,$num) {
      $str = "<ul>";
      for ($i=0;$i<$num;$i++) {
        $str .= "<li><a href=\\"".$arr[$i]['link']."\\" 
target=\\"".$arr[$i]['title']."\\">".$arr[$i]['title']."</a></li>";
      }
      $str .= "</ul>";
      return $str;
    }

    /*  create a new object from the XML_RSS class and parse that sucker */
    $rss =& new XML_RSS("http://enter_rss_feed_here");
    $rss->parse();
   $channels = $rss->getChannelInfo();

  /*  Now, display the feed using the parse_feed function */
?>
<html>
<body>
<a href="<?=$channels['link']; ?>" target="<?=$channels['title']; 
?>"><?=$channels['title']; ?></a>
<?= parse_feed($rss->getItems(),3); ?>
</body>
</html>

True, but unless you call it email.gif a spammer would have to OCR every 
image on your site.

I like the combination approach-- email as image, but links to contact 
form. At least then people who can't read images can still contact you, 
and people who hate webforms can email you.

As a side note if you've never done this, keep the email address that 
the form responds to strictly server-side. There are a lot of old 
form-to-mail scripts out there that accept the email address as a post 
variable, which makes them an excellent outgoing mail server for spammers.

A another solution might be to just continue the foreach if you 
encounter a variable you don't want to display:

foreach ($_POST as $key=>$value) {
    if ($key=="submit") *continue*;
    print "$key => $value<br />/r/n";

Correct. However, if the form posts to itself and I want to retain on
the form the selection(s) made by the user...how would I do that?

Since a multi-select can contain multiple values, you need to use a 
variable that can hold multiple values. If you add brakcets [] to your 
field name for the multi-select, then the values will be contained in 
an array by that name.

<select name="varName[]" multiple size=5>

Get data from database. You should get it in a Array if you have stored every thing in one field which i hope you have done it.

Now simply explode it and display it.

I could not get any help from the web. So i did it my way. Hope this will help you


<?php
$Parking = explode("," ,$PropertyDetails[Parking_Garaging]);
//$count = count($Parking);
//echo $Parking[$i];
//while($count < 4)
//for($i=0;$i<=5;$i++)
foreach ($Parking as $value)
{
if($value =="Carport")
{
$value1 = $value;
}
if($value =="Single Garage")
{
$value2 = $value;
}
?>
<select name="Parking_Garaging[]"  multiple size="6">
<option value="Carport"
<?php
//if($PropertyDetails[Parking_Garaging]=="Carport")
if($value1 =="Carport")
{											 echo "Selected";

Actually, I wasn't going to store it in a single field. Each item needed
to be stored in a separate field. But I'll hang on to this code since it
will help me with some other problems I'm working on.

Small clarification.

Here is the post variable from the multi-select box (I used
print_r($_post) to get this). DL_mCategories is the name of the select
box. 

 [DL_mCategories] => Array ( [0] => 2 [1] => 11 [2] => 3 ) 

The question is, how do I manipulate that array so that the multi-select
box is "preselected" with the user's selections. That is, when the form
posts to itself I don't want the user's selections to disappear.

I think you need to generate your select box via a function, and not 
straight in HTML. A little bit less efficient, I know, but maybe one of 
the only ways to get the result you want.

Here's a quick function that I think will work (I didn't test it, but 
there you go):

function select_box($name,$option,$post='') {
  if ( empty ($post) ) {
    $post = array();
  }
 
  $str = "\
<select name=\\"$name[]\\" size=\\"10\\" multiple>";
  foreach ($option as $key=>$val) {
    if ( in_array($val,$post) ) {
      $str .="<option value=\\"$val\\" selected>$key</option>\
";
    } else {
      $str .= "<option value=\\"$val\\">$key</option>\
";
    }
  }
  $str .= "</select>\
";
  return $str;
}

So, let's say your option string, that you get from your database or 
whatever, looks like this:
$option = array (
        'Select text 1'=>1,
        'Select text 2'=>2,
        'Select text 3'=>3
      )
     

Put the result of this function in a variable, and echo it out on your 
webpage:
$displaySelect = select_box('MultipleSelect',$option);
echo $displaySelect;

If you error out, and want to redisplay the multiple selects, you only 
need to run something like:

if (isset ($error) ) {
  $displaySelect = 
select_box('MultipleSelect',$option,$_POST['MultipleSelect']);
}


echo out the $displaySelect, and you should be set.

I can't speak the veracity of this particular code (I didn't test it), 
but I know the principle behind it works quite well.

Here's a very interesting study about where spammers get their email 
addresses from:

http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.pdf

As we all suspected, the main one is web page spiders.  They found that, 
for now, hiding addresses using HTML Character Entities is enough to foil 
the spammers.

I strongly advise against JavaScript solutions, since not all people have 
JavaScript on, let alone, available.

I tend to use a server side form, as others have suggested.  There's an
easy to use, secure, one in my Form Solution class.  All it takes is two
lines to instantiate the class and one line to call the method.  Can't
beat it.  It's available via the link in my signature, below.

By the way, I've overhauled my website and programs.  The site is easier
to navigate, plus the scripts are now open sourced, so go check 'em out!  
I'm polishing off the revisions to the Java version of the Credit Card
Validation Solution at this moment.

Enjoy,

I recently rolled my own whitelist script (in Perl) that consults a DB
file to see if the return-path of incoming mail matches an address or
domain found in my database. If it's not, it sends back a note saying gee
I'm so sorry, your email has been rejected by my antispam system bla bla
bla, please go to http://dmintzweb.com/whitelist.php to submit a request
to have your email added to my whitelist and sorry for the inconvenience.
I manually evaluate every such request. Usually, of course, my canned
counter-messages bounce because the address is bogus, and I route them
into the trash. But here's the funny part:  I got a whitelist request from
one of the Nigerian oil ministry scammers, you know, the URGENT BUSINESS
PROPOSAL dudes. The guy apparently had taken the trouble to fill in the
form manually and submit it, putting his spiel in the Comments textarea.
Woa.

It's working good. Occasionally someone legit get inconvenienced, but I'm
beating fully 100% of the penis enlargement crap (and cheerfully muddling
along just fine with my little one, thanks).

Subject: php and COM server...
Message-ID: <Law14-OE70ZLFjwscTE000060e1@hotmail.com>

Hi all, 

I'm trying to implement a very primitive COM server which has an object with only one method, returning an integer when called. As you can imagine, I'm kinda playing around before beginning a new project. I'm using Delphi to implement the COM server and in the lights of the limited php documentation on this issue, I've found that the only COM interface php can support is the IDispatch one, and implemented the server according to these findings. Anyways, I tried running it using ASP (keep your crosses inside, just testing the COM :) )  and it worked as it should. When I tried to run it using php, the COM object initiated without any problems, but when I call the method I get the following error:
---------------------------
php.exe - Application Error
---------------------------
The instruction at "0x00000001" referenced memory at "0x00000001". The memory could not be "read".


Click on OK to terminate the program
Click on CANCEL to debug the program
---------------------------
OK   Cancel   
---------------------------


Did anyone in this list try to implement something similar? Any pointers, docs, etc. greatly appreciated.
BTW, I'm currently running PHP Version 4.3.2-dev

Did you write the COM object yourself? 

Just playing the percentages, I'd say most likely there is a subtle
oversight in the COM object. The Microsoft product family tends to let
stuff slide. An outside product tends to play with all the documented
rules, in terms of number of parameters expected, data type of the
return value, and especially scope of variables. 

Always watch for and remember: null <> numeric zero <> zero-length
string.

Also, have you checked the threading model of the object. Doesn't VB
often use some kind of hybrid threading model called "apartment"? ASP
will deal with it, of course. It is possible that PHP doesn't support
that?

Sorry I couldn't go much deeper.

If you cut n paste the whole object code I could look at it.

Subject: Looking for a PHP equivalent to Perl Text::Template
Message-ID: <p0521021fbadc88285e13@[192.168.0.2]>

Hello,

I'm looking to a PHP equivalent to the Perl module Text::Template.

I was perusing the Smarty documentation, but, maybe I missed 
something, but it doesn't look that I can use  it the in same way.

What I want to do is to assign the result of parsing the template to 
a variable. This is very convenient for example when you need to send 
email.

---------------------------------------------
Perl example:
---------------------------------------------

Dear {$title} {$lastname},
It has come to our attention that you are delinquent in your
         {$monthname[$last_paid_month]} payment.  Please remit
         ${sprintf("%.2f", $amount)} immediately, or your patellae may
         be needlessly endangered.
Love,
Mark "Vizopteryx" Dominus

---------------------------------------------
Perl code:
---------------------------------------------

use Text::Template;
my $template = Text::Template->new(SOURCE => 'formletter.tmpl');
my @monthname = qw(January February March April May June
                            July August September October November December);
         my %vars = (title => 'Mr.',
                     firstname => 'Bill',
                     lastname => 'Gates',
                     last_paid_month => 1,   # February
                     amount => 392.12,
                     monthname => \\@monthname,
                    );
my $result = $template->fill_in(HASH => \\%vars);
<http://perl.plover.com/Template/Manual.html#example>
---------------------------------------------

Now, I know that I could write my own parser based on regex, but if 
something exists like this in PHP, I rather use it.

I know that I can use an include like this (or built on this and use 
a "here document"):

<?php

$var = 'PHP';

return $var;

?>
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php>

But its just not convenient for non programmers because they will 
need to escape the quotes that hold the string.

So, is there like a beast like the Perl Text::Template in the PHP world?

TIA

Subject: Why Smarty?
Message-ID: <p05210220badc8c2e4f73@[192.168.0.2]>

Beside caching, why use Smarty? I'm a little bit puzzled by this.
<http://smarty.php.net/whyuse.php>

I'm already using a MVC model to do all my PHP development.

It look to me that Smarty is recreating its own mini language ? la EmbedPerl.
<http://perl.apache.org/embperl/pod/intro/Intro.-page-4-.htm>

Is there an advantage in that? Am I missing something here?

Please, don't see this as flames bait. I just want to hear about the 
pro and con.

TIA

Cheers

Smarty's main feature, as I understand it, is to help developers separate
presentation from logic.

I think what you will find is that Smarty is less beneficial to developers who
are already very organized in terms of the software architecture they use
(whether you subscribe to the MVC school of thought or not).

Of course, the same argument can be said for OOP. You can nearly achieve the
same level of organization with an intelligent software design. However, OOP is
very popular due to the way it encourages or aids in such organization, and for
similar reasons, Smarty is also very popular due to the way it can aid in
separating presentation from logic.

My guess is that you will find fewer benefits (since you use an MVC model
already) than someone whose software design can be summarized as "every page is
a single PHP script".

Hope that helps.

Chris

Emmanuel,

	Smarty is pure MVC...

	The business logic model is completely in the programmers hands (me)
and  can be passed off design to people who like to make pretty pictures...
with the caveat that they get the Smarty template logic to make repetative
stuff like tables easy without diving into the complexity of a full blown
language. 

	Smarty is the go-between Controller with a built in debugger.

	I can support thousands more pages now that I don't have to think
about layout or coach designers through script code.

	If you maintain a small site and enjoy layout detail yourself then
this tool is still cool but probably unnecessary...

I might be having a brain freeze but I believe it stands for "Multilevel

Hello Chris,

Interesting, are you opposing MVC to OOP?  Am I reading too much in 
your statement?

For my part I use OOP in MVC.

Usually, my model is in OOP (class files) and the controler is done 
with procedural functions (a file with the switch control structure 
that control the views) and the view is a file with small snippet of 
PHP code.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

But as I said, I implement the MVC model without Smarty for clients 
that will tell  their designers to modify the design of the view. In 
this case, beside using {} instead of <?php ?>, I really don't see 
the advantage.

I don't have Dreamweaver, but I know that <?php ?> is flagged as a 
tag, and I'm not sure if this is the case with {}.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

You could do essentially this by bringing the template into your 
controlling script and eval()'ing it -- something like:

$template= file_get_contents("/path/to/template.html");
$command= "\\$output= \\"$template\\";";
eval($command);
print $output;


You couldn't pull off the sprintf() call in the middle of that, but 
everything else will work. You don't even need the curly brackets.

I only meant to draw a comparison between OOP and Smarty as things that can
help people organize their code more clearly, but things that aren't
necessarily required to do so. I'm not sure if that made any more sense. :-)

My only point was to say that someone using an MVC architecture is going to
benefit less from Smarty than those with no real software design.

Thanks for suggestions PSaw, you were right, I've tried to implement the COM
Server using VB and everything works fine now. I'm really wondering what
kind of incompatibility was causing the problem though, Hope the COM
interface in PHP will get mature soon since they're talking about supporting
.NET which are -most of the time- wrapped with COM servers.

the meta-point of tools like smarty is to remove busy work from our work
queues... any time we can use a good third party tool that promotes decent
architecture and separation of duties its just one more thing we don't to

You can use the output buffer functions. Easier than eval, and you can use
all of the php functions to build the output.
Look at ob_start() and ob_get_contents()....

this are one of the overlooked treassures in php ; )

You could do essentially this by bringing the template into your
controlling script and eval()'ing it -- something like:

$template= file_get_contents("/path/to/template.html");
$command= "\\$output= \\"$template\\";";
eval($command);
print $output;


You couldn't pull off the sprintf() call in the middle of that, but
everything else will work. You don't even need the curly brackets.

Wouldn't you still need to eval() the template in order to substitute 
runtime values for the placeholders?
Output buffering would clean up the code I suggested, but I'm not sure 
how it would solve the problem of separating logic and design...

does this strike anyone as a little dangerous? hiding executable code that
operates at the same level of permissions amongst text files could get
confusing in large batches... especially if the replacement gets complex.

maybe build a simple template function  lib based on str_replace... that way
all your logic can stay in one file and allow someone else to upkeep the
documents.

Yes, I think that they DoS'ed themselves when announcing the latest edition.

TRUE-- you should add slashes to $template before eval()ing it in order 
to escape any quotes that would allow executable statements.

Given that correction I don't think this is so risky. A malicious 
template author could still reveal the contents of any global variable, 
so I wouldn't let just anyone define the contents of $template.

 If you have a fixed set of values to be replaced then it might indeed 
be easier/safer to build something using the array feature of str_replace.

Lets see.
Suppose you have a page like this:

<?php
 ... set variables


?>

Dear <? echo $title.' '.$lastname ?>
It has come to our attention that you are delinquent in your
        <? echo $monthname[$last_paid_month]?> payment.  Please remit
        <? sprintf("%.2f", $amount) ?> immediately, or your patellae may
        be needlessly endangered.
Love,
Mark "Vizopteryx" Dominus

-------------

Add a ob_start(); at the start of the page, and this at the end
<?
$buffer = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();
?>

now, nothing gets output to the screen and buffer has your content.
This of course is a simple example, should be enough for an idea.

I have nearly a million XML files generated from the database for products
in my OSSuite application.  What is the best way to handle so many tiny
files?  Windows crawl to its knees when I try to open up the directory where
the files locate at.  Is there a way to optimize disk I/O?

first of all: wow.

second, is it necessary to have the info outside of the database as files? 
can you create an XML document on the fly by request? 

I do this out of a 10 year old proprietary db with 2000+ requests an hour
and it seems to work fine. IF you can, let the db handle your storage

I'm doing everything that you mention below.  Each file associates with a
product.  It also has an image as well.  The image will have IPTC header
that describe the product, price, model, make and etc.  Let me know if you
need more info.  Thanks.

I've thought of that.  I'm still in the learning mode.  Any advice is
greatly appreciated.  By the way, my team is thinking about implementing
webservices for our product OSSuite after we saw the demo at NYPHP several
months ago.

db's were MADE to do exactly what you want... associate, index and retrieve
vast quantites of data quickly. it's really pretty easy to fill out xml
templates with db calls and mysql can do thousands if not millions an hour.

check this simple example out:

Well normally its suffice to say that if you have even > 1000 XML files that
you shouldn't even be using XML @ all ... if you need to query out an XML to
someone (say a client or web service client) then you'd build a layer
between a database and the client to format the results to XML and use the
same tool to suck in the data.

Client/XML <-> [My PHP Layer] <-> Database

Do you know if your current method is sucking up all the XML into
DOM/Memory?  This would cause the box to crawl to a halt.

How about creating a tiered directory structure [0-9a-z]/[0-9a-z] so the
file "xmlfiles/myfile.xml" would be stored as xmlfiles/m/y/myfile.xml. On
average you'd end up with (1 million / (36*36)) = 771 files per directory
which even windows can handle.

I would have to agree with Gary on this one.  As far as I can tell, if 
you're processing a million xml files, you're going to be limited by 
hardware requirements on your Windows box; if you want to speed the i/o 
up, get a Cheetah or more processor power/RAM.  If you do the coding for 
the xml dump on the fly, you're going to cut down your access time 
signficantly (I would imagine).  As it is, even just reading the file 
directory of a million files is going to hang (or crash!) your PC.

So, import the files into a database and get rid of the XML files.

Importing the XML files into a database is an ideal solution,
unfortunately, not always an available one, such as in my case.  I have
space on a remote server where database access is very expensive (it's my
own site and out of my price range to afford db access), so I have to
resort to XML as well.  PHP parses XML extremely fast and efficiently; I
highly recommend it.

I'd use PHP's available XML parsers along with grouping them into
directories sorted by a date or some other delimiter to allow for smaller
amount of files per directory.

Do you have to specify the CFID and CFTOKEN somehow?  Perhaps in the POST URL
or as a referrer?

Thank you all for your quick responses.  I'll consider generating XML on the
fly (still new at this).  Here's another question.  Besides importing the
files to dB, is there another way to index and query large volumes of
documents.  I'm going out of tangent a bit here.  Let say, I'm archiving
tons of document for a public library.  They want to scan and digitize
millions of articles.  What is the best way to index and search for articles
say by keywords or captions?

Either XQuery or XPath (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpxpath/) ...

But even then to build up the doc in DOM will never work ... when your
definition of "large volumes" gets over a certain point I don't think you
have any other options except a DB.  If you have many small (say ~< 100kb)
XML then Id run a query over the docs and cache the results.

"How do you make traditional database languages like SQL (Structured Query
Language) work with XML?" asked W3C spokeswoman Janet Daly in an interview
with CNET News.com. "The XML Query working group has been putting together a
framework of documents that provide the technical answer to that question,
so that XML documents can start to look like parts of one massive database."

What I kinda find a little dumb is if SQL is already a standard why does it
have to work w/ XML?  If a database was open to the web what is wrong with
just querying it in the first place ...

there is great benefit to xml because the mark-up can give the data
*meaningful and relational labels*

if I give a schema or DTD(the xml rules im playing with) to a business
partner s/he can write an XSLT(translator) to use the information in a
variety of formats
independent of connectivity or output source
ie.,
<pre>
<sender>
	<name> gary</name>
	<job>hacker</job>
</sender>

parsed to

<div>name:gary<p /> job:hacker</div>

or

Gary is a hacker

or *spoken*
</pre>

once your backend is up the parsing and verifying of good data is TOTALLY
left to our silicon friends.

besides... quite a few db's now store xml natively (Apache Xindice)
http://xml.apache.org/xindice/

pretty cool

Matthew,
I don't know if you're serious but in case you are I'd like to make it clear that I'm looking for PHP code (preferably a class) for managing the contents (e-mail messages) of an mbox file.

Try to use Btree as in binary tree. In a folder with many files like more than 50,000, it will crawl. Any would.

That is why in Zope, there is a binary tree by Andy Mckay (is that Andy's work?) to deal with this type of stuff.
 
Or you can create many folders (simulating btree with folders). Create hashes (indices) to store where XML files are at. 

However, the fact you have that many files is like a need to re-think your solution. Perhaps, you can use Sleepycat DB. 

All the best

Subject: needed web programming tutor for 10 year old
Message-ID: <BADE8B20.99D%jackson@identitymap.com>

This is definitely an unusual request.

A friend's friend has a 10 year old who would like to learn web
programming for this summer.

If someone who would like to take up this challenge. Tutoring would probably
take 2-3 hours per session, 2-3 times a week during weekdays.
Teaching time is flexible and tutoring fee is open for discussion.  If
interested, please contact Randy at projectconsultants at yahoo.com or I can
forward it to him.

About the potential student:
He has been in the States for 3 months in Long Island City, NY, and
is just beginning to adjust to the language.  He had
extensive English and computer tutoring at the Pagan
school in Harbin, China but his English is not advanced
enough to be taught in standard classroom level.  He
currently attends UNIS United Nations school but has
problems because his computer skills are at a higher
level than his peers but the language is a barrier.

Here's the deal,

We have few hundred php files and a few hundred include files for our site.
When viewing a php file I find myself constantly opening more and more
files.
File A has an include of file B which has an include of file C etc ...

What I'd like to do is when viewing a file (in my browser via a php script):
All function calls will be a link to view the file and line where the
function is defined.
All includes / requires will be a link to view the file.
All local href links and form actions will be a link to view the file.

1. Before I go and re-invent the wheel, does anything like this already
exist ? (in php of course).
I'm guessing that the better PHP IDEs (like zend studio) probably have
something like this built in, but I want a total server side solution.

2. If nothing like this already exists, would anyone be interested in
writing this with me as an open source project ?

Thanx
Ophir

Something like:  http://lxr.php.net

There are loads of commercial packages as well, although I'm not familiar
with them.

Sure; I'm not sure how close lxr is to what you need, but kick some specs
around and I'd be happy to write some code.

Yeah, I hear ya.  We'll be getting something going soon to address these, and
other issues.

In the meantime, consider just visiting the archives on a regular basis, or
better yet, your mail client/provider must support filtering of some sort (I
filter everything to talk at nyphp.org to a seperate folder).

I looked at lxr, but it doesn't seem to be doing what I want.

I'll write up a more detailed specs of the functionality :)

an aside...

	a binary tree is a specific example of a btree... one that can have
up to 2 branches from each node. A generalized btree can have N branches
from a given node. The search depth of an N branch btree (how may nodes to
check b4 you get your info) can give definite advantages if an application
can suck up big bunches of information at any given iteration (example:
reading from disk).  

I agree that a btree is a pretty good solution to the big bunches of files
problem but the very best implementations are already done for us (in db's)

Thanks, yeah I thought that too ... any ideas on how anyone?  I ended up
throwing it all over to Perl (which I didn't want to do):

shell_exec("perl clipboard.pl $value")

use Win32::Clipboard;
$CLIP = Win32::Clipboard();
$CLIP->Set($ARGV[0]);

Hi Folks,

I got a very interesting question. When I try to use PHP to
produce a dowload file, I usually use header, like this:


header("Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel;
charset=$dest_charset");
print(" " . $content); 

I print the very long string out with a specfic header
information.

This code works fine on windows, linux machines, but it doesn't
work for Mac. Mac will download an url instead of a excel file.
the above code, will give me aa abc.xls file on windows and
linux, but will give me an url, like
this"http://www.abc.com/app.shtml?nam=a&execid=1212" on Mac, and
I can't open it!

This things bother me a lot, Could some one help me out:

1)Do I need to configure browser on that Mac to plug in some
applications?

2)How to change the header to let Mac to download an excel file
with a specified name and extension instaead of a
url(http://www.abc.com/app.shtml?nam=a&execid=1212)

Thanks for your help!

Hello, 
Filtering incoming NYPHP mail to a separate directory is an alternative or unsubscribing and viewing the archive, but I at least want to say something to the list when I have something that's on my mind (like now. heh).

No biggie.  I'll work around this for now.    Everybody is nice on this list anyway. =)

The easiest way to make a digest is to have the system email the archive
page as HTML formatted email.  For instance, this page here:
http://www.nyphp.org/content/mailinglist/marchive.php?list=YToyOntpOjA7czoxO
iIyIjtpOjE7aTowO30=

If you get this to work, then just give subscriber option to subscribe to
each message, or to digest.

That's my 2 cents :-)

Yeah, I hear ya.  We'll be getting something going soon to address these,
and
other issues.

In the meantime, consider just visiting the archives on a regular basis,
or
better yet, your mail client/provider must support filtering of some sort
(I
filter everything to talk at nyphp.org to a seperate folder).

Hi Gary,

I still can't open it on the Mac. I can open this in windows
with no problem. It still gives me a url in eMac, it doesn't
give me the "downloaded.csv".
Please advise!

Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XML files
Message-ID: <86713EAB93BD5F40B94A0C8E604C7C91AEC09C@index-exchange.indexstock.com>

Hi Anirudh,
 
Long time no hear.  Thank you and everyone at NYPHP <mailto:everyone at NYPHP>
for the solution.  I learn a great deal in the last day and half.  As Chalu
had noted, I need to rethink through the solution again.  Pumping out nearly
a million XML files is not the best practice.  Last night, I accepted Gary
Malcolm's invitation to look at Xindice.  Xindice uses Xpath and Xupdate, it
addresses some of my concerns (not certain how many records it can support
though, but I can categorize).  Unfortunately, Xindice does not have a PHP
client for their API.  I need to figure out something for this.  
 
Your sample codes resolve my large volume of files should I ever need to
spit out more XML files.
 
Now, I have a whole new set of problems.  Lets say, I need to share data
with some companies.  The XML files get changed and must be updated on my
system or their system depending on who is/are the recipient(s) of the
changes.  Since I have nearly a million records, how do I keep track of
changes?  Importing everything back into Xindice or whatever repository in a
multiple of X times will generate a lot unnecessary traffic.  On the other
hand, updating only the changes will require a lot of tracking (timestamp)
as well.  Finally, giving appropriate hook to the partners will require an
extensive predefined business rules (I don't know it all and I don't assume
to know my partners/users business workflow either) and some sort of version
control for rollback and approval process similarly to CMS.  Thought
anybody?
 
Thanks for all the suggestions guys.
Larry

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] XML files
 
Larry
 
Let's have look about your problems 1 by 1
 
1: Problem of storing and accessing large volume of files in 1 container
directory.
 
A: In such cases splitted directory structure solution is best like what
"Rick Seeger" has suggested. Hence you can design a special directory
structure that can generate new directory as and when total amout of files
execeeds the limit say... 100 files per directory. Below sample function
does that (it generate new directory as soon as "id" exceeds value 100)
 
// CRATES A DIRECTORY ACCORDING TO GIVEN ID AND PARENT DIR PATH
function createDir($id,$parent)
{
    $nd_dirlimit = 100;

    $mod = ceil($id/$nd_dirlimit) - 1;
 
    $dirs = $mod * $nd_dirlimit + 1;
    $dire = $dirs + $nd_dirlimit - 1;
 
    $tempDir = $dirs."_".$dire;
 
    if(! file_exists("$parent/$tempDir"))
          mkdir("$parent/$tempDir",0777);
 
    return "$tempDir";
}
By above method dirctory structure will be like ../1_100/, ../101_200/,
../201_300/ and in each directory file name with id say "1.xml" to "100.xml"
(or with any name) will reside. Once above directory structure is
implemented no script will crawl like now :D.
 
2: Importing Data into DB by parsing XML files
 
A: Use php's file "XPath.class.php" this is very nice OO file to parse XML
documents at greater speed. It has lot of easy to use method and properties
like $xml->evaluate, $xml->setAttributes, $xml->appendChild,
$xml->removeAttribute, $xml->exportToFile etc...by which you can parse lot
of XML documents like playing Zigsaw puzzles. It is very handy, class based
php file. Check example at
http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~sa386/php/XPath_V2/testBench/useCases/
<http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~sa386/php/XPath_V2/testBench/useCases/> 
 
Some times it is useful to use Utilities of Perl and executing your perl/cgi
scripts from console level. This very fastest and reliable method IF such
doucmens are to be generated, read or write in batch mode. Perl's XML::DOM
package helps here. Other advantage of such mechanism is that you can run
such scripts seperately from other servers that has connection with your DB
server, hence reduction of overhaed on your main server that has php scripts
running.
 
Another method is XSQL that is powerful but still new to us and PHP, where
your DB SQL is written directly into XML file that syncronises (update your
XML document from DB by executing XSQL) your XML and DB from 2 ways. (Can't
tell much here :( )
 
3: Is there another way to index and query large volumes of documents?
 
A: I am not getting here exactly your problem, But if you need faster
document access from directory or file system (serching 1 file from million
files) then answer of 1 st question can help here where you just need to
search particular document from 100 files from documnet diretory, already
given from DB.
 
And if question is related to Data then use of indexes (Indexing commonly
used fields in Db like primary keys and foreigh keys) in mysql can make
"Access of record" faster.

Another suggestion is to look or wait for ADODB
(http://php.weblogs.com/ADOdb) to support XML out of the box, there seems to
be an ongoing discussion here:

ly,

after a bit of googling around "ie for mac" i find that this problem
(dynamic file download) seems to be pervasive. 

phpbuilder.com suggests exhorting mac end-users to switch to netscape 6+...
or emailing a fix/bug suggestion to the m$ ie for mac team (talk about
swimming upstream!).

i'll keep an eye out for work arounds.

This is the kind of stuff you need the workflow for.

I am speaking in pseudo.

For example, XML files are published. Then, somebody comes along and changes 
it. That pushes the state to say "retracted" or "changed". This event in a 
workflow system can trigger an action.

Before the state change, you could have an opportunity to execute rules.

This is not a simple arena as you need a way to define rules. There have been 
several attempts such as ZPatterns (available in Zope or Java). 

This enables you to define at the interface level as in receiving data to 
trigger actions. In ZPatterns, you can use ZPatterns language (declarative) 
to define behaviors of data reception. Unfortunately, this approach is not 
for average for it is difficult to work with. Just get into this rarefied 
Pattern language and all. 

None of XML related stuff will address workflow or aspect-oriented programming 
because XML files themselves need to remember what state they are in. 

If it is a possibility to mix and match, you can publish XML files into Zope. 
That gets you workflow. XML files will be available through web or FTP. When 
it gets changed, it can do some processing.

Good luck

Hi everybody,

I am trying to write a small web application with
sessions.  I get a warnings when i try to reload a
page.
the warnings are the following.
-----
Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]:
read returned less bytes than requested in
/home/httpd/htdocs/blog/admin/index.php on line 1

Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]:
Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already
sent (output started at

------

what would be giving this warning?

Thanks for the help,
Alexander Chan

Thanks for your help! but it can't be opened by TextEdit after
save, If there is no way to open it by Spredsheet, I will

Thanks again!!!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XML files
Message-ID: <86713EAB93BD5F40B94A0C8E604C7C91AEC0A4@index-exchange.indexstock.com>

Chalu,
Unfortunately OSSuite is a LAMP based product, not Python.  It is missing
CMS/workflow engine.  You and I have worked with Zope for a while.  We
understand the importance behind workflow.  Hopefully, my team can
re-architect a framework that will incorporate a workflow engine for
OSSuite.  We are writing a spec for that as we speak. I just want to add XML
into the mix.  Anirudh and I chatted about this awhile back.  I think it is
time to take a closer look at XML and other best of breed technology.
Whatever we come up with, resource is still an issue.  Hopefully, some of
you can help us out.  Anybody?

This is the kind of stuff you need the workflow for.

I am speaking in pseudo.

For example, XML files are published. Then, somebody comes along and changes
it. That pushes the state to say "retracted" or "changed". This event in a
workflow system can trigger an action.

Before the state change, you could have an opportunity to execute rules.

This is not a simple arena as you need a way to define rules. There have
been
several attempts such as ZPatterns (available in Zope or Java).

This enables you to define at the interface level as in receiving data to
trigger actions. In ZPatterns, you can use ZPatterns language (declarative)
to define behaviors of data reception. Unfortunately, this approach is not
for average for it is difficult to work with. Just get into this rarefied
Pattern language and all.

None of XML related stuff will address workflow or aspect-oriented
programming
because XML files themselves need to remember what state they are in.

If it is a possibility to mix and match, you can publish XML files into
Zope.
That gets you workflow. XML files will be available through web or FTP. When
it gets changed, it can do some processing.

Good luck

Subject: Global settings in PHP
Message-ID: <FOEEICMBOEKAAJBJHNMIKEPDDJAA.anthony@emr.net>

Hey List!

I am somewhat new to php, though not to web development.  I am attempting to
send information from a web form to a php document.  I then want to create
session variables and have the ability to manipulate the session variables
as needed.

The book I have use examples throughout that require the following setting
in the php.ini file:

register_globals = On

This elevates the need for $_POST["my_posted_data"] when retrieving posted
data.

Also it allows me to register session variables as such:

session_register("variable_1", "variable_2", "variable_3", "variable_4",
"variable_5", "variable_6")

as well as do other things with sessions.

I am wondering what the pros and cons are of setting globals to "on".  It
seams to be a convenience, but are there any downsides or security issues?

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Hi Anthony,

Though convenient, global vars are more or less a no-no; security is the 
major reason.
If you have code that's something like:
    if (check_login($session)) {
        $logged_in = 1;
    }
I could simply set a url like page.php?logged_in=1 and have it override 
your check.

There are usually 3 solutions to this:  initialize all your variables 
(and set error_reporting to E_ALL to be sure), turn off the ability of 
GET, POST, and cookie values to create variables, or disable 
register_globals.

The big one for me, however, is that register_globals defaults to Off in 
php as of 4.2 which means that, if you rely on them, your code will not 
be portable to other servers who have a different configurations (and 
might not be willing to bend on modifying php.ini for the reasons stated 
above).

Hark!  Burn that book!

Seriously though, I would not use that book to learn from.  register_globals
= On is a curse from the early days of PHP and needs to be eliminated, for
several reasons.

1) Security - a user can override variables in your script and cause absolute
havoc very easily.

2) Style - As I've said, register_globals has probably been the one setting
that has hurt PHP's reputation as an 'Enterprise Solution.'  Granted, I don't
know what that means either, but it's not good programming style to use it.

3) Compatibility - Modern version of PHP (since about 4.2.x I think) default
to register_globals = Off.  As such, your scripts won't work with modern
servers and any convienence you've found in using it now will be dwarfed by
future dealings with your server administrator, other developers, users and
the public in general.

4) People will laugh at you!

Sorry to be so harsh, but I feel very strongly about this one  :)

Absolutely, and the superglobals (ie $_POST, $_GET) make it a breeze.  Just a
tip, though, unless there's a dollar sign (variable) inside the braces, use
single quotes.  $_POST['my_posted_data'] is much faster.

Yeah, basically all cons.  The only pro could be considered short-term
convenience, but as I mentioned, you'll end up paying for it.

We (NYPHP) are looking for one, too :)

So far I haven't been able to find anything nice.  Our current job board,
despite steadfast efforts by Sklar, can't offer what we'd like.  I believe
Chris is working on a better system, and this will be a continuing Open
Source project of NYPHP.

plus using php's myriad and fantastic array manipulation functions directly
on $_SESSION and $_POST ends up making
code very consistent and clear.

hint: extract()ing the SESSION or POST makes for less typing :)

Greetings,

Have any of you had any success using the Lotus Notes functions that have
been in PHP since version 4.0.5 (http://php.net/manual/en/ref.notes.php)?

They're still classified as experimental - probably because the sockets
interface is also experimental - and have little to no documentation in
either the manual or the web in general.   In particular I'd like to know
if there are any compile time flags or platform specific gotchas to be
aware of.

My immediate goal is to connect from an AMP installation on Windows 2000 to
an unencrypted local Notes database, and would eventually like to connect
from a LAMP installation to Domino if possible.

Thanks in advance for any help,
-Dan

If you are still looking, I could help out here.

Briefly, I have been a webmaster, senior developer and 
a desktop graphics specialist. I have tutored new users 
on software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Quark, 
and PowerPoint.

I have been told I am an excellent teacher. I prepare a 
learning plan, provide tip sheets and teach shortcuts 
and optimized techniques right up front.

I have 7 years of web programming and design experience.

Today, I actively program PHP, SQL, XML, JavaScript, CSS 
and XHTML.

I maintain a website that has tutorials, research and 
links on web topics. Contact me, if you would like to 
discuss this further.

This is definitely an unusual request.

A friend's friend has a 10 year old who would like to learn web
programming for this summer.

If someone who would like to take up this challenge. Tutoring would
probably take 2-3 hours per session, 2-3 times a week during weekdays.
Teaching time is flexible and tutoring fee is open for discussion.  If
interested, please contact Randy at projectconsultants at yahoo.com or I
can forward it to him.

About the potential student:
He has been in the States for 3 months in Long Island City, NY, and is
just beginning to adjust to the language.  He had extensive English and
computer tutoring at the Pagan school in Harbin, China but his English
is not advanced enough to be taught in standard classroom level.  He
currently attends UNIS United Nations school but has problems because
his computer skills are at a higher level than his peers but the
language is a barrier.

Teaching a 10 year to do programming does test the limit of programming as a
language.  I believe the magic of programming is in action (writing a code)
and result (getting an actual response).  Common language, English, helps
but how to demonstrate that magic and have a child remember it for life is
the challenge.

If you are interested, I can refer you for further discussion.

It's true -- there is a new, extensible jobs board on the way.
I've been unexpectedly stuck in a theater running video projections for 
the last week. They let me out for food but not coding. :-(

We wrap tomorrow.

I'm the skeptic.  Please provide me with some references about how people can teach a programming language (or concept) without any other communcative medium other than the programming language itself.

Teaching a 10 year to do programming does test the limit of programming as 
a
language.  I believe the magic of programming is in action (writing a
code)
and result (getting an actual response).  Common language, English, helps
but how to demonstrate that magic and have a child remember it for life is
the challenge.

If you are interested, I can refer you for further discussion.

I thought the student had basic English? 
To solve this...

My first thought is for a bilingual friend or family member 
to sit in on the sessions and translate.

Alternatively, if I prepare documentation in good simple 
clear English and save in text only format, we can 
run it through a free translation web site and probably 
get good results. 

Also, I believe that entry-level coded concepts 
in CSS, XHTML and JavaScript presented in English, can be 
made clear regardless of student native language.

Other entry-level concepts such as: 
what is the internet, 
what is a web server, 
what is an HTTP header, 
how does dynamic server-side processing work,
what is a database,
how does a browser work, 
how to insert client-side code...

...all these are made most clear with schematic-style 
illustrations, rather than lengthy descriptions.

I believe this could work out using one of the 
scenarios I have described. 

Feel free to email me at psaw at pswebcode.com if you'd 
like to discuss more.

Hi,

There is an organization based here in Colorado by the name of NACSE -
www.nacse.com

NACSE is non-profit, vendor-neutral and provides certification in many
areas such as networking, telephony, project management to name a few.
Although the name "national" appears in the name, there are NACSE
chapters in several countries including Japan, China, Singapore,
Australia, Canada... etc,

btw, NACSE did *not* pay me to say this  :)

This past year I've managed to get a LAMP training program started at a
division of a local community college here in Denver, with the
opportunity to earn a credential in Open Source venues such as [L]AMP.
We have scheduled a PHP and MySQL course for June 23 (see www.php.net).

You might shoot a quick email to Bob Kile, (cc'd) who's the Executive
Director of NACSE.

Regards,
John

I couldn't find one so I started writing one myself about two months 
ago to replace out current custom one (FileMaker). Although it is 
turning out to be quite an endeavor for one person. Kind of a groupware 
plus specialized additions. I would be interested in helping out with 
any projects out there in this arena.

Joe,

go to the downloads section of php.net.  grab the tarball for your
distribution.

unpack, install.

this among other things mod_php4.c.

if you do it right, it will also install it into your apache dir so when you
rebuild apache it's there. (or you can build it for dynamic modules...but I
never do that.)

Thanks Cal,
I downloaded PHP 4.3.2RC2 from the php.net site and it is apparently not in
there. From the http://www.php.net/downloads.php site only php-4.3.1.tar.gz is
available, could it be that the latest release is incomplete, I'll go back to an
earlier release and see.
Thanks

Subject: $_SESSION
Message-ID: <18D7B8CAA5284F478470828806DB124603789DF2@psle01.xchg.pwj.com>

I'm hoping someone can help me with this... I am running PHP 4.1.2 on
WINNT4.0 in CGI mode.
 
All I'm trying to do (as a test), is write data to a session object using
the $_SESSION superglobal, like so:
 
<?php
session_register('test_var');
$_SESSION['test_var'] = "Hello World";
PRINT $_SESSION['test_var'];
?>
 
The variable 'test_var' registers, but the value 'Hello World' does not get
written. What's even more confusing is that the script prints 'Hello World'
to the screen. It seems like PHP is interpreting $_SESSION['test_var'] as a
custom built associative array, since it is printing the value but not
storing it in the session file.
 
Some folks suggested it may be a compatibility issue between $_SESSION and
register_globals = On - So I turned them off and it still doesn't work.
 
The session files are writable if I use the registered globals, but that is
both insecure and a pain because I have to pay attention to scope within
functions.
 
Anybody have any suggestions on what the problem could be?
 
Thanks.

i suggest not using regiser...
just change the $_SESSION array directly asmixing and matching the session
functions and the direct access can really blow things up...

from the manual:
 With $_SESSION, there is no need to use the session_register(),
session_unregister(), session_is_registered() functions.

more from the manual:
There is a defect in PHP 4.2.3 and earlier. If you register a new session
variable by using session_register(), the entry in the global scope and the
$_SESSION entry will not reference the same value until the next
session_start(). I.e. a modification to the newly registered global variable
will not be reflected by the $_SESSION entry. This has been corrected in PHP
4.3.

The only thing I can think of is that you have to populate the variable 
first then register it.

<?php
$test_var = "Hello World";
session_register('test_var');
PRINT $_SESSION['test_var'];
?>

Hope I'm thinking correctly.

Hi Gary,
Did you use Microsoft Office's Excel for Mac to open CSV files,
or you use Mac's default application AppleWork 6's SpreadSheet
to open it? If you used SpreadSheet, how did you configure it?

Thanks for your Help!

Subject: Zend Studio questions - newbie
Message-ID: <000701c315ab$52eb5050$6501a8c0@EZDSDELL>

Keep in mind that I'm coming from a Windows/DreamWeaver environment...so
here goes.

In DreamWeaver, files are automatically "FTP'ed" up to the server when
you preview them and, when you're done editing a file you tell it to
upload the file. I keep my files on local hard drive and upload when
editing is done.

So the question is, what's the equivalent in Zend Studio? I don't want
to edit the files directly on the server (then my local hard drive will
be out of sync with the files). So...if I edit my files locally, what's
the easiest way to get them up to the server? (I believe I had tried a
sort of drag-and-drop between the Project & Filesystem tab. However, a
file named about_us.php became about_us2.php when I did it this
way...maybe I'm overlooking something?)

Subject: MySQL WHERE clause question
Message-ID: <000601c315d6$e58243d0$6501a8c0@EZDSDELL>

This question concerns how to format a "WHERE" clause so that it only
finds those records that have a particular word buried within the text.
For example, if my WHERE clause has "DE_sDescription LIKE "%ford%" it
will return records that have the word "affordable" in the description
field. But if I remove the wild cards, then it doesn't find those
records that may have the word "ford" buried within a text (the text
runs 500 characters at the max).

Any pointers would be *greatly* appreciated.

Please clarify. You want be able to find this: "Meet me at the ford
dealership"

but not this: "This car is affordable"

Right?

"Select * Where Description Like 'ford %' or like '% ford' or like '% ford
%'"

the first like finds 'ford ' at the beginning of the description.
the second like finds ' ford' at the end of the description.
and the last like finds the word 'ford' within the body that is surrounded
by spaces.

I'm not the best at SQL though.

"Select * Where Description Like 'ford %' or like '% ford' or like '% ford

the first like finds 'ford ' at the beginning of the description.
the second like finds ' ford' at the end of the description.
and the last like finds the word 'ford' within the body that is surrounded

This question concerns how to format a "WHERE" clause so that it only
finds those records that have a particular word buried within the text.
For example, if my WHERE clause has "DE_sDescription LIKE "%ford%" it
will return records that have the word "affordable" in the description
field. But if I remove the wild cards, then it doesn't find those
records that may have the word "ford" buried within a text (the text
runs 500 characters at the max).
 
Any pointers would be *greatly* appreciated.

This won't find "Buy a ford."

I'm not an SQL expert, but I'm constantly dealing with similar issues
in a "search and replace" context.

Could you first pass the Description through a regexp that translates
all punctuation into spaces?  It could also put a space before and
after the Description, so that you could skip the "Like 'ford %'"
and "Like '% ford'" parts.

This seems to have worked!!!!

Here's the full query:

SELECT * FROM tblDealerSearchList WHERE (DE_bMakeLive = 1) AND
DE_sCategories LIKE '%,2,%' AND ( ( DE_sDescription LIKE "ford %"OR
DE_sDescription LIKE "% ford"OR DE_sDescription LIKE "% ford %") ) ORDER
BY DE_sTargetLevel DESC, DE_sCompanyName ASC 

Here are some of the results:
======
Bobs Ford Parts

90 and newer ford car parts. All years mustangs.
=======
Saved Auto Parts, Inc.

We specialize in factory takeoff Dodge and Ford parts.
======
Ace Antique Automotive

Ford Parts 1932-1953


=============================

What's the difference between "SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE `column`
REGEXP "[[:blank:]]ford[[:blank:]]"
and using this - "DE_sDescription LIKE  'ford %' OR DE_sDescription LIKE
'% ford' OR DE_sDescription LIKE  '% ford %'"

In this case of the former (the REGEXP) it would seem that if "ford" is
the first word in the text it would not pick it up since there is no
blank/space before "ford" at the beginning of the text.

Is this correct?
Or...in terms of speed, would it be better to use the REGEXP expression
in the same way I'm using the "%" wildcard? (that is...with the
different variations of blanks).

You may want to try making it cleaner, like this:

SELECT "column_name" 
FROM "table_name" 
WHERE "column_name" IN ('value1', 'value2', ...) 

http://www.1keydata.com/sql/sqlin.html

As far as speed go, I would not worry too much with modern DBMS.  If you do
get a lot of hits then you can try making a separate result table within the
DBMS that gets updated automatically, i.e., once a day.  At this point, all
your code has to do is just grab everyting from the result table without
making a lot of comparisons in the main table.

Just a side note,

If you're gonna be searching for a word within a column using LIKE, you
should consider using MySQLs full text engine.
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Fulltext_Search.html

If performance is not an issue and you're only doing this once in a while,
then using LIKE shouldn't be to bad.

Regarding your REGEXP, this probably isn't the best solution, but I'd use:
REGEXP "^ford | ford |ford$".

Subject: Short Term Job - Lake Success, NY
Message-ID: <sebb79df.012@mail.ipro.org>

Hi all, I'll be needing some PHP help for a couple of months starting late May.

I need someone who can hack up the Sitellite SAF, http://www.simian.ca/saf.html 

I have a few sites running this, and I'll be redesigning all of them, hacking in some extra features and customising some of the fucntionality, plus rewriting most of the content. The site is http://www.ipro.org 

This will be pretty intensive and should last about 8 weeks. The office is in Lake Success, NY, which is near New Hyde Park, Long Island. It's just outside Queens. A lift may be available if you don't have your own transport or public transport isn't viable.

I don't care about qualifications etc., but 3 examples of work, personal or commercial, are required.  Please review the SAF and feel comfortable digging around in it. Previous content management experience is essential, whether it's using other packages, hacking up Nuke, whatever - you'll need some CMS experience.

I'm not privy to the Finance department's policies, but I imagine the rate will be around $40 to $50 / hour. I anticipate four eight-hour days a week for six to eight weeks. Needless to say, this could lead to future opportunities.

Please download the SAF and view the IPRO site before responding. This is onsite work, business casual.

If you have any questions you can call me on 516.326.7767 x 407

Cheers,

Jaz

I use require when I'm just calling in function libraries and includes
like a server-side include.

But otherwise, they do seem to behave similarily, don't they..

Basically, if you try to include a file that doesn't exist, you get a
warning, but the PHP file keeps getting processed.  If you try to

I would always use _once unless I specifically need to repeat something...

good point about continuing processing on a not found error.. but why
would I try to include/require a file that doesn't exist? :)

*LOL* ever worked in a big ill-defined multi programmer project? or worse...
multiple designers?

really though getting my designers to keep up a naming scheme on their
templates is like trying to keep a dozen puppies in a cardboard box.

Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F903390B426@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

Pinyo,

Yes, I believe it is slower, but it's harder to say if it matters. For me,
on my sites, I don't notice it just as it hard to notice the difference, for
example, between 0.1 sec and 0.3 seconds.  

The value it brings in handling string searches sanely is worth it.  It
seems that the SQL language was never constructed for these kinds of queries
and the LIKE operator can only do so much. 

The "hairy" aspect of this issue is writing the parser that constructs the
query to do the searching. Which columns, noise words, phrases, word rooting
and logical combinations of words and phrases are some of the aspects that
have to be addressed (or not, you can always punt).

actually, if you really need it, it should be faster, not slower.

doing a search for a single word on 1,000,000 rows on a text column (not
varchar) will be much faster with a text search index.

I like how they tried to present it as an objective viewpoint, yet don't
provide a link for more info about PHP in the summary as they do with
ASP.NET.

Otherwise, the corollaries come across as desperation.

In the end, there are times to one or the other. In the case of ASP.NET,
that time is when you are forced to.

is this article a joke...?

I especially like:

<quote>
Out of the box, ASP.NET v1.0 supports the following languages: 

C# 
Visual Basic .NET 
Managed C++ 
JScript 
</quote>


C#!? JScript!!??!  you've got to pulling my leg.

also
<quote>
the PHP language is not strongly typed (that is, if you compare the string
"4" to the integer 4, the result is true), which causes problems when
building larger applications
</quote>

heard of === ? int_val? is_int?  Web work with strongly typed languages is a
pain in the ass. There's a reason ML
(http://www.dcs.napier.ac.uk/course-notes/sml/manual.html) is used only by
university faculty... 

M$ smells bad.

"JScript" ... didn't even see that one! 
Client side scripting is supported by .NET ... no shit Sherlock!

And it better support your own languages too ... Wouldn't it be funny
is .NET did not support VB .NET? It's like PHP not supporting ... 
well ... mod-php. 

Wonder why they didn't include the lines:

Hi,

Pardon me if the answer to this question is obvious, but is there a way to
define my own constants that are global for all php scripts?

I see that I could auto_prepend a file to every script, but I'm more
interested in being able to set my own constant.

Something like PATH_TO_DEVTOOLS ...

Maybe there is a better way to do something like this?

I have a file with my system wide defines ( define( "THING", defintion); )
as an include on another file where i put my most common includes (like my
db classes).
I then will include the second file to avoid tons of includes in each
script.

defines are global within individual scripts.

works well for me...

I'm curious how others handle this seemingly common issue.

This whole concept seems slashdot worthy - I added the article for 
review; let's see if they bite.  From the outside looking in, they 
attempt to make their case, but the examples are specious at best (as 
Gary so eloquently put below).  I'd have loved to see a PHP developer 
write one half of this article and an ASP.NET developer write the other 
half.  C'est la vie.

It was a smooth lo-calorie tidbit. 

For me, though, the article most fully amplifies that, at last, 
after so much time Microsoft has finally engaged enough gears and 
can even attempt such a slim and daring head to head.

It does not change that ASP.NET, far from being a radical and innovative
rewrite 
is an infusion of tasty XML, Java and C strategies monumentally hoisted
on top of the 
hardcore Windows Server environment and the "out from leftfield"
introduction of 
more kludge like the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) code and 
common language runtime (CLR) will be contributing to overall
performance hits 
on IIS web server environments everywhere.

Everyone please take a moment and commiserate with them now, those 
glassy-eyed programmers, who are in some way remain sisters and
brothers, 
who have to hoist that heavy, heavy .NET chain and keep on keepin on. 
Frankly, I think .NET experience will make all of them stronger 
opensource programmers when they are ready.

something that I do is put this at the top of every page

require_once($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/LIB.php");

with the contents of LIB.php including:

$ROOT = "/path/to/home/dir";
$HTROOT = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
$FUNCTIONS = "$HTROOT/FUNCTIONS";
$INCLUDES = "$HTROOT/INCLUDES";

$IMAGES = "$WEBROOT/images";


which I use as global vars...

I also do things like session_start() and other similar global
activities in this file (or files included/required from LIB.php), i.e.
db connections, 


note: make sure that these files don't produce any output or they will
interfere with session/cookie setting

That's what I do.  I have a file called _header.inc, which has all the
functions and definitions I need most of the time.  It also draws the
top of each page, so that I have the same layout on each page.  Then,
in every .php file, I just include( './_header.inc' );, and start
writing the body of the page.

This seems to be the best solution, but the problem I have with this is that
you still have a path definition in every file. If for some reason that
location changes, you have to change it in all your scripts.

I'm sure I could search and replace the whole lot of them, but it just
strikes me as messy.

The situation in which it arises the most is when I have a shared set of
development tools that I use on various pages across several different
virtual hosts.

I don't want to do this:

    include("/usr/blah/blah/blah/blah/devtools.php");

I'd rather do this:

    include(DEVTOOLS);  //  DEVTOOLS is defined in one place server wide

do you define the default include directory in your php.ini? It can have a
list of paths... 
(I put the path to PEAR, and the path to my typical includes there) AND it's
outside of my docroot

Hi,

Pardon me if the answer to this question is obvious, but is there a way to
define my own constants that are global for all php scripts?

I see that I could auto_prepend a file to every script, but I'm more
interested in being able to set my own constant.

Something like PATH_TO_DEVTOOLS ...

Maybe there is a better way to do something like this?

include_once... solves 2 scripts calling the same include

There are several options.

If you need constants, then the only way is to:

define('SOMETHING','SOMEVALUE');

in an include-type of file.  I'm a big fan of auto_prepend.

If you don't need it to be a constant (heck, if someone changes the value,
it's their lose) and you're using mod_php, I very much like something like
this in httpd.conf:

SetEnv SOMETHING 'SOMEVALUE'

which will be accesible via $_SERVER['SOMETHING'];  This is very handy and I
use it alot.  Also note that you can SetEnv in .htaccess, <Directory> or even
<Files> directives, so it's a real flexible way of setting things up.

Lastly, you can use shared memory.  Once set, they are available until reboot
(or they are released).  This is also extremely handy, and the most flexible,
but is a bit more involved to get started with.

And, I seem to remember there was a way to actually make a constant
definition in Apache's httpd.conf but I can't recall it now.  Oh well, maybe
I'll think of it.

Subject: Named parameters
Message-ID: <p05210209bae1b8c6bbf5@[192.168.0.2]>

I miss named parameters for function in PHP.

Is there a better way to do it than that:

function namedParams ( $ar ) {
	echo $ar['param1'] . " " . $ar['param2'];
}

namedParams ( array ('param1' => "Hello", 'param2' => "World!") );

--> Hello World!

I could have done something like:

$params = array (
	'param1' => "Hello",
	'param2' => "World!");
namedParams ($params);

But my feeling is that in both case, it look ugly.

Usually, named parameters are there for readability, which, in my 
example, is not really the case.

Is there any technique that I'm missing here?

Cheers

Not really, AFAIK you need to use an associative array to fake named
params in PHP.

However, if you use extract() at the top of your function, it makes
referencing the variables much easier (and better looking) inside the
function:

function namedParams ( $ar ) {
    extract ( $ar ); 

    echo "$param1 $param2";
}

extract() will import variables from an array into the current symbol
table. You can optionally decide whether they should overwrite
existing variables and also prefix their name with a constant.

See http://www.php.net/extract

PS: I notice this hint is missing from Recipe 6.4 (Using Named
Parameters) of the Cookbook. Oops. More material for the second
edition. :)

Not quite sure what you are asking, but you may want to look into the 
extract() function. It converts an array into variables using the array 
keys for the name of the variables.

Subject: Losing data on post (sorta)
Message-ID: <000a01c3167f$16464ef0$6501a8c0@EZDSDELL>

I have a form that has a multi-select dropdown. When the user clicks
'submit' the data is posted to a "confirmation" form. The confirmation
form checks the data. If there is an error, the user goes back to the
form. 1 out of 3 times when you go back and forth between the form and
the confirmation page, the posted data from the dropdown is "lost." Yes,
in the form everything is still selected but it doesn't post.

Any clues?

I'm using IE 6 in case that's the issue. Further, I'm using sessions.
Some sample code is below. (It's quite possible I'm doing something
wrong here.)

Jeff
=============================

Code from the very top of the form the user fills out.

	session_start();
	header("Cache-control: private");  //IE 6 Fix
	session_register('srDE_sCompanyName', 'srDE_sFname',
'srDE_sLname', 'srDE_sAddr1',
	
'srDE_sAddr2','srDE_sCity','srDE_sState','srDE_sZipcode','srDE_sCountry'
,'srDE_sAreaCode',
	
'srDE_sPhone','srDE_sTollFree','srDE_sFax','srDE_sEmail','srDE_sURL','sr
DE_sDescription',
		'srDE_sCategories');

Code from the very top of the user confirmation form


	session_start();
	header("Cache-control: private"); // IE 6.0 Fix
	$root = getenv('DOCUMENT_ROOT');
	include_once($root . '/include/global.inc.php');
	include_once($root .
'/include/dealer_search_submission.inc.php');


I get an error message (sometimes...as noted earlier) when I check the
value of this var: $_SESSION['srDE_sCategories'] . This is the variable
that stores the multiple categories. 
Sometimes it has a value...sometimes it does not.

I thought about full text but even if the user manages to find all 5000
records (we're not talking millions here) I only display the first 200
matches...kinda forces the user to come up with better search criteria
to narrow their own search.

Just a side note,

If you're gonna be searching for a word within a column using LIKE, you
should consider using MySQLs full text engine.
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Fulltext_Search.html

If performance is not an issue and you're only doing this once in a
while, then using LIKE shouldn't be to bad.

Regarding your REGEXP, this probably isn't the best solution, but I'd
use: REGEXP "^ford | ford |ford$".

That sounds like a design problem. Why should the user go back?

You can avoid the problem you describe entirely by re-displaying the form if
there is an error (highlighting and/or describing the errors, of course). Then
you can prefill the form howver you like. This is much more reliable, but more
importantly, it's much more user-friendly.

Hope that helps.

You're correct. It *was* a design problem.

I simply moved the session_register stuff to the confirmation page
and...after cleaning my glasses <g> I realized that I looped through the
array ($_SESSION['srDE_sCategories'] is an array from the multi-select
box) BEFORE I had "officially" set the value of this session variable.
Then everything worked fine. (Sometimes the act of writing an email
"clears the mind" and makes the solution apparent.)

Dear Reader,

For many years the open source Berkeley DB libraries have been a
popular choice for embedded database applications.  It has been
so ubiquitously used that chances are, you rely on some software
product that embeds Berkeley DB.

It is therefore pretty exciting when SleepyCat, the maintainers
of Berkeley DB, announce that they will be releasing an XML-aware
version of their database software.  Our main feature this week,
from Paul Ford, explores Berkeley DB XML and its facilities.
Paul includes plenty of sample code to get you started.

<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/05/07/bdb.html>

In "Transforming XML" this month, Bob DuCharme looks at the upcoming
new version of XSLT, XSLT 2.0, and in particular, its support for
tokenizing strings.  Using the development branch of the popular
XSLT engine Saxon, Bob shows how an SVG polygon path can be
processed with XSLT 2.0.

<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/05/07/tr.html>

Finally this week, Kendall Clark brings us our regular dose of
news from the XML community. It appears that development of the
core XML specification itself is held up by the need to incorporate
Internationalized Resource Identifiers, which are destined to
supsersede URIs. Kendall also comments on the recent release of
new XQuery specifications from the W3C.

Thanks Adam and Brent,

The pointer to extract is a good one. And Adam, I feel a shame that I 
didn't check the Recipe 6.4 in the PHP Cookbook, especially when your 
book sit on my desk all day long. (for the others that don't  have 
the book, you can6 download the recipies here: 
<http://examples.oreilly.com/phpckbk/>)

I came up with my own version combining extract () and the spirit of 
Adam's recipe (clearly identified parameters).

function formatItem ( $args ) {
   $argsDefault = array (
           'title' => date ('r'),
           'link' => "http://blog.scriptdigital.com",
           'description' => "Whatever...",
           'category' =>  "Out of the box");

     extract ($argsDefault, EXTR_PREFIX_ALL, 'arg');
     extract ($args, EXTR_PREFIX_ALL, 'arg');

     $item = "";
     $item .= "<title>$arg_title</title>\
";
     $item .= "<link>$arg_link</link>\
";
     $item .= "<description>$arg_description</description>\
";
     $item .= "<category>$arg_category</category>\
";

     return $item;

}

$rssItem = array (
       'link' => "http://apple.com",
       'description' => "Apple web site.");

$rssItem = formatItem ( $rssItem );
echo $rssItem;

-->
<title>Sat, 10 May 2003 14:19:42 -0400</title>
<link>http://apple.com</link>
<description>Apple web site.</description>
<category>Out of the box</category>


Look nice?

Cheers

A cleaner way might be to use array_merge instead of extract because 
you can more easily return an arrray.

function sanitize ( $args ) {
   $argsDefault = array (
           'title' => date ('r'),
           'link' => "http://blog.scriptdigital.com",
           'description' => "Whatever...",
           'category' =>  "Out of the box");

     $args = array_merge ($argsDefault, $args);
     return $args;
}

$item = array (
       'link' => "http://apple.com",
       'description' => "Apple web site.");

$cleanItem = sanitize ( $item );

$xmlItem = "";
foreach ($cleanItem as $xmltag => $val) {
   $xmlItem .= "<$xmltag>$val</$xmltag>\
";
}

echo $xmlItem;

Yes, I was going to suggest something like this instead because it
allows you to alter the array of items and without needing to update
the rest of the code.

I have built a database with about 12 tables

I have a <form></form> which is long-ish but not so long that it HAS to be
broken up into multiple pages.

The problem is, on submit, I need different form values to be submitted to
different tables in the database.  How do I build an insert statement like
that?

Also... people are supposed to be able to upload an image with this project.
I think best practices call for storing the image in a file and using php to
create a link to that image which gets stored as a text 'url' in the
database associated with the record it needs to show up in...

How is *this* accomplished?  *this* being... asking for someone to somehow
insert the local image path and then, on submit, moving the image to the
right place on the server and creating the 'url' that goes into the database
and putting it in the database?

Thanks for any pointers...

Cheers,

Hi Joshua,

The inserts can be broken apart into different tables by using different 
sql queries.  For example:
$sql[0] = "insert into table1 values ($_POST[1],$_POST[2])";
$sql[1] = "insert into table2 values ($_POST[3],$_POST[4])";

$res[0] = mysql_query($sql[0]);
$res[1] = mysql_query($sql[1]);

As for file upload - I would recommend checking out 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php for some great, 
secure examples.  As a caveat, nota bene that you need to use the <input 
type="file"> form field and make sure the form type is set to 
enctype="multipart/form-data".

You use more than one insert statement.

Just write the images to the filesystem somewhere under document root (in an
images directory perhaps), then you can store either the relative or absolute
URL in the database. That makes it very convenient to display the images,
because you simply use the value in the database as the value of the href
attribute of your anchor tag.

Well, you don't really "create" a URL. When you write a file within document
root, it is available via HTTP. For example, if your document root is
/usr/local/apache/htdocs, and you write a file in
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/images/foo.png, that image is available, and your
relative URL would be /images/foo.png.

As far as the form field you want to use, just try <input type="file">. Then,
check the $_FILE[] array upon submission, and you'll get an idea about what you
need to do. If you need help writing the file, just search the online manual.

Hope that helps.

Chris

In case it wasn't obvious, I meant image tag here, not anchor tag.

You can't.  You need to build lots of insert statements, ideally wrapped 
in a transaction so you can roll back in case one of them fails.

You definitely don't want to write to user-provided directories.  There 
are a number of solutions, one of them something I've done for years and 
what we do at CCI as well.  Assign a unique id to the image, convert 
that id to an MD5 hash, breaking it out into two or three nodes like 
957/ae1.  Then you would write the image to 
IMAGE_DIR/957/ae1/IMAGE_ID.gif (or whatever extension).

To play it back to the user's browser:

<?php
     $hash_string  = md5($image_id);
     $node1 = substr($hash_string, 0, 3);
     $node2 = substr($hash_string, 3, 3)
     $image_ref = IMAGE_DIR . "/$node1/$node2/${image_id}.gif";
?>

     <IMG SRC="<?= $image_ref ?>" BORDER="0">;

An added advantage to this approach is that it balances out the image 
directory tree naturally so you don't have ten zillion files in the 
"Jan" directory and only a few in the "Feb" directory.

Make sure you use relative path to image, as opposed to server path or URL.
This way you will have greater flexibility later on, also you don't have to
store so much redundant informaiton.

I have never used ASP.net, but for the record, the programmer would write the 
application in Jscript and it would be compiled into the CLR which would run on 
the server, not the client.
Why? is another story. I guess the MS market research department did a study 
and found out there were a bunch of javascripters who refused to learn a server-
side language.
But really, the concept of writing in any language and having it work with 
other programmer's code written in a different language is at least interesting.

JScript/JavaScript has actually been a server-side language for sometime, in 
various servers.

The old Netscape servers used to support it, and it's always been an option 
- along with the default VBScript - in ASP.  There was even an option to use 
PerlScript in IIS, I believe.

Another thing you may want to consider is renaming the uploaded file to a
unique value, like the value of time(). This will prevent multiple images
uploaded with the same name from overwriting each other. You should also
make sure you build some kind of check on the filetype to stop users from
uploading unsupported of malicious types.

Maybe a dumb question but wouldn't it be true that any open language could
really be integrated with PHP (either via module or otherwise) ... I mean
there is open Spidermonkey for JS and Perl dll (perl58.dll) could be
integrated correct?  I personally find the word "support" to be the most
broadest term in technology and if someone were to ask Gates what .Net
supports you know he would come out with a Bill Clinton tounge saying "Well
that depends on what your definition of "support" is" ...

Id find it true that if you could shell_exec in any language, everything
under the sun is supported until your favorite .dll or .so comes along :-)
Which would probably make "framework" the 2nd broadest term in technology
...

Don't forget that if you're uploading files through a form, you must include enctype or 
encoding as an attribute of the form tag.  This can be a big "gotcha" for file uploads.

Well, lets not get carried away over flaming ASP.NET here, the platform
definitely has some advantages and it doesn't hurt to know what it has to
offer.  Microsoft propaganda obviously isn't the best source for learning
about the platform :)

ASP.NET has a collection of controls that automate what they've dubbed
"post-back".  Basically a form can make round-trips to the server by posting
itself using Javascript (or the subset MS has decided to call JScript) when
values change, when things are clicked, etc.  Also, these web controls can
be set to automatically generate JScript code to verify values, do a popup
to alert the user to invalid value range, etc.  So that's what I believe
they're referring to - the ability to generate client JScript code to do
perform some pretty complicated client-side behavior.

I think what we can learn from that as PHP programmers is that there is a
place for doing a "post-back" to the server, and that we can develop similar
"controls" that will make it easier for us to write client-side validation
(among other things) code.  In fact, I'm sure there is tons of code already
available to do this - so the MS article is definitely off-center in its
"objective" comparison of the two platforms.

Is this how they do that wicked file upload thing where you can actually 
view the progress of a multipart form submission? Or is it something 
internal to IIS?

I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out some way of showing 
file upload progress that isn't just the browser's status bar.

This is nothing new.  It is a rehash of ideas (surprise) that has been
around for decades, i.e., CORBA, and now Web Services.  As a person who has
used both technologies, I can say, save yourself 50% of your time by
switching from ASP to PHP, and save another 50% by stop writing code for
NS4.  :-P

I have never used ASP.net, but for the record, the programmer would write
the 
application in Jscript and it would be compiled into the CLR which would run
on 
the server, not the client.
Why? is another story. I guess the MS market research department did a study

and found out there were a bunch of javascripters who refused to learn a
server-
side language.

[[:<:]]

an alnum character (as defined by ctype(3)) or an underscore (_).

You can do SELECT * WHERE DE_sDescription REGEX "[[:<:]]ford[[:>:]]";

Not sure how the speed would compare, but it may be faster.

Message-ID: <p05210206bae5aa8e9d33@[192.168.0.2]>

PHP Version 4.2.2
Windows NT 5.0

Hello,

I'm working for a client that have the configuration above.

It seems that the $_SERVER global is not created and so I can't use 
for example $_SERVER['PHP_SELF ']. No big deal since I can get the 
same info with getenv('SCRIPT_NAME').

I can ask the client to make modifications to the server php.ini and 
I was wondering if there is something to do there.

I had a look here, but don't see any answers.
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.php#reserved.variables.server>

Also, I'd like to find a way to get the referer. $_ENV is not 
available (variables_order doesn't contains 'E' in php.ini) but I 
doubt its a solution since I did some test with Perl listing all the 
environment variable and there is no referer variable that I can see.

I tried that in Perl:

#! perl -w

use CGI ':standard';

print header ('text/plain');
foreach $k (keys %ENV) {
	print "$k = $ENV{$k}\
";
}

and this (with CGI.pm): referer ().

without results.

The CGI Environment Variables defined on the following page doesn't 
seems to list a way to get the referer so I don't see how I could use 
getenv for that.

Is that a cut-and-paste from your code? There is an extra white space after
the F!
 $_SERVER['PHP_SELF '] should be  $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']

Thanks for the sharp eyes, but in my code it was definitely 
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] with no space. I just did another test and still 
get this:

>Notice :  Undefined index:  PHP_SELF in...

I think I pasted $_SERVER['PHP_SELF '] from php.net, and somehow, 
Safari added a white space.

Sure, thanks for taking the time to have a look at my client php.ini.

<http://scriptdigital.com/test/phpinfowin.html>

I copied the file from the client server, deleted some sensitive 
stuff and uploaded it to my server.

What about getenv('PHP_SELF');  or print_r($_SERVER); or var_dump($_SERVER); 
any sign of PHP_SELF?

Perhaps a variables_order issue?

The referer should be set; that is if the browser sent it previously.  I'm on
shakey ground here with IIS, but perhaps an upgrade of PHP (especially
concerning IIS, as I think there's been a lot of improvements in the
multithreaded environments).  A check that IIS isn't configured strangely,
too?

I see you have your variables_order as GPC.  I think you need to add an 
"E" (ie. EGPC) to the php.ini file to read in the environment variables 
(look for the variables_order flag).

Nope, I have tried all that, and it always return an empty array.

Hmm, not sure I understand what you are saying here.  Do you mean 
that I have to add 'E' to the variables_order. Is the environment is 
somehow related? The PHP says that its better not to set 'E' for 
optimal performance.

Well, I think an upgrade of PHP is out of the question. I don't have 
any control on the server, and the sysop is extra cautious. And for 
IIS, I don't know what to say because my knowledge of this beast is 
almost zero. I wish they ran PHP on Linux or FreeBSD.

Thanks anyway for your help.

Yes, thanks gadhra, but as I said in a previous post, even Perl can 
list an environment variable for the referer, and my understanding is 
that the $_SERVER global is not related to $_ENV.

Hi Emmanuel.

	It sounds like your server config is not showing you all
the useful variables, but I just wanted to make sure you already
checked the following general HTTP issue:

	Web pages only have "referers" when a previous document
hyperlinked to them.  If you just type the URL of your web page
into a web browser, there won't actually be a referer, because no 
other (previous) page referred to it.  In this case the referer
variable is either unset, blank, or perhaps just a hyphen (this
is what the Apache logs seem to use).

	For testing purposes, you can create a short HTML page
which just hyperlinks to your web (PHP or Perl) page.  Then, your
PHP or Perl script will show the URL of the short HTML page as
the "referer."

	So make sure your PHP/Perl page really does have a "referer" 
before you start blaming PHP or IIS for not showing it to you!


Best, George.

Ahh, my mistake; I was leaning towards 'S'

If I remember correctly from your phpinfo output, variables_order was set
only to GPC.  Give GPCS a shot, which may at least get a bit closer to
resolving why $_SERVER is empty.

Don't we all  :)

But it may be worth pushing for it a bit; older PHP on Windows (especially
under IIS) is typically a Bad Thing from what I hear, but as you mentioned,
IIS is uncharted terroritory for me as well.

Best of luck,

Hello George,

I did this test also before posting but from apple.com and other 
website. Then I thought that the staging server is behind a firewall. 
So I did exactly what you suggested and now its working with 
getenv('HTTP_REFERER').

So, to make a story short, I can get the referer/referrer :) when I'm 
in the firewall, but from outside the firewall, I get nothing which 
is a bummer.

Thanks for your help.

Off course. I feel such like a fool! Well, in fact, I was not sure 
where to look.

Well, I will ask first the sysop to make a modification to the 
variables_order in the php.ini and put 'GPCS', then, well, as they 
say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it :).

Thanks for your help and suggestions.

Hi all,

I am setting up a machine with AMP.  From what I have read I am thinking
that the following is the setup that I should install:

Apache 2.0.45
MySQL 4.0
PHP 4.3.1

I'd like some feedback to know if I am on the right track.

Thx!

Hi Aaron:

I'd go with 1.3.27.  Very solid.

I would recommend the latest Apache 1.3.x instead, especially since you plan on
building it with PHP.

Which file are you trying to download and install?

I just tried the link for the apache 1.3.27 binary (MSI installer) and

Is this how they do that wicked file upload thing where you can actually

view the progress of a multipart form submission? Or is it something 
internal to IIS?

I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out some way of showing 
file upload progress that isn't just the browser's status bar.

True, but it is a different concept than web services. Rather than making 
distributed systems communicate, it is more like PHP, Javascript and Perl all 
being compiled and running together on a JVM.

Okay...so this ain't a PHP question. In discussions I've had with some
others I was told to stay away from PHP/MySQL based-chat (they'll be
enough going on with the site vis-a-vis PHP/MySQL that there is no
compelling reason to add chat to the list) and that I'd be better off
with something Java-based. I've briefly examined Volano Chat and Real
Chat. Just wondering if anyone had any experience with any of these
software items.

<?= $vals[$index][attributes][QUESTION] ?>

The value of this 3-dim array displays just fine within my document,
unless, of course, the value contains "funky" (or foreign) characters, then
it comes across horribly scrambled.  

What do you recommend I do to ensure that the value comes across just fine?
For example:

if $vals[$index][attributes][QUESTION] = "What is your favorite part of
V&#228;lsignalandet?"  Then it comes across rather nastily onscreen when I
want to see "a-umlaut" with the rest of the lettering intact.  

Thanx

[[:<:]]
[[:>:]]
These match the null string at the beginning and end of a word
respectively. A word is defined as a sequence of word characters which
is neither preceded nor followed by word characters. A word character is
an alnum character (as defined by ctype(3)) or an underscore (_).
mysql> SELECT "a word a" REGEXP "[[:<:]]word[[:>:]]";      -> 1
mysql> SELECT "a xword a" REGEXP "[[:<:]]word[[:>:]]";     -> 0

You can do SELECT * WHERE DE_sDescription REGEX "[[:<:]]ford[[:>:]]";

Not sure how the speed would compare, but it may be faster.

Message-ID: <F1A298B653966043A0B8114139C5A1E614529D@exchsvr1.4kidsent.com>

Hey All,

I wanted to start by saying how useful I find these mailing lists.  Although
this is the first time that I'm submitting a question, I have found
following the threads from other people's questions very valuable as I move
into becoming an intermediate PHPer.

That said, I have a question regarding forms and protecting them against
browser refreshes.  I have written a PHP program that emails a user's
password to their registered email address upon request.  The main program
looks like this:

	//HARVEST VARIABLES
	$query_msg = $_POST['query_msg'];
	$login = $_POST['login'];
	$email = $_POST['email'];
	
	//MAIN
	if (!empty($query_msg) && $query_msg != 'Password Found') { #Skip
MySQL query first time form is called & after password found
		GetData();
	}

	$query_msg != 'Password Found' # Leave form only when successful
		? ShowForm() # Display the form
		: ShowSuccess($login,$email); # Show Success

~GetData() goes to a MySQL database and sets the global variable $query_msg
equal to 'Password Found' if a query on their login name or email matches,
and then sends an email to their address with their password.
~ShowForm() sets up an HTML form with either login or email passed (user's
submission choice) and sends along $query_msg with it as a hidden input
type.
~ShowSuccess() is a general message that displays when the password is
found.

The problem is that someone could tinker around to find a valid user name,
then keep hitting refresh and send dozens (or more) emails to that user.
GetData() is not skipped because a refresh brings back $query_msg from
$_POST (which is the previous value of $query_msg) and not the global
variable value of 'Password Found'.

Is there a way to set the variable directly in $_POST so that it will pass
back the a newer value upon refresh?  Or is there a way to have the program
call itself again and pass new POSTed variables?

***I realized setting this form up that there are probably a dozen other
ways a malicious user could try to break any form.  Does there exist
anywhere a "Safest Form Practices" document?  I'm sure there are other
security issues that I'm not aware of that need to be guarded against.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Erik

First off, regardless of the value stored in this array, put single quotes
around the static key names -- I assume attributes and QUESTION aren't
contants.  Also, I tend to always use <?php tag syntax to ensure 
operability on various systems.

  <?php= $vals[$index]['attributes']['QUESTION'] ?>

Well, that has nothing to do with PHP or arrays.  It probably has more to
do with your web browser and fonts on your machine.  What do you mean by
"comes across rather nastily onscreen?"

I run my own DB class, which has it's own error handler for MYSQL
errors.  My problem is that whenever it spits out an error, I just get
the mysql error, which does a great job of describing the actaul sql
error, BUT... my issue is that my method requires a few includes.
 
SO, whenever I get my DB error, I never actually know which script the
error is coming from.  So.. the QUESTION:  Is there a variable, or a way
of formulating a variable, aside from settine a scriptname var at the
top of every file, that displays the file that the current class,
function, error, etc was called from?
 
Thanks!!!

Subject: Creating multidimensional arrays
Message-ID: <p05210221bae7e9675959@[192.168.0.2]>

Hello,

I have this little function that work well for me, but I was 
wondering if it could be optimized. I use it to set the default value 
of checked radio buttons. Also, while doing this function, I 
discovered that PHP can autoinstantiate associative arrays in depth. 
For ex.

$ar = array ();
$ar['one']['two']['three'] = 'hello world';

echo $ar['one']['two']['three'];

--> hello world

I must say that PHP's array are one of the nicest feature of the language.

--------------------------------------------------------
Here's what it look inserted in the HTML page:
--------------------------------------------------------

<hr>
<form>
Are you ugly?
Yes
<input type="radio" name="choice_1" value="1" <?php echo 
$radioGroup['1']['1'] ?>>
No
<input type="radio" name="choice_1" value="1" <?php echo 
$radioGroup['1']['2'] ?>>
<hr>
Are you tall?
Yes
<input type="radio" name="choice_2" value="1" <?php echo 
$radioGroup['2']['1'] ?>>
No
<input type="radio" name="choice_2" value="1" <?php echo 
$radioGroup['2']['2'] ?>>
<hr>
Are you funny?
Yes
<input type="radio" name="choice_3" value="1" <?php echo 
$radioGroup['3']['1'] ?>>
No
<input type="radio" name="choice_3" value="1" <?php echo 
$radioGroup['3']['2'] ?>>
</form>

--------------------------------------------------------
And here's the function:
--------------------------------------------------------

function assignValues ($maxOutArrays, $maxInArrays, $arSelection) {

   $counter1   = 1;
   while ( $counter1 <= $maxOutArrays ) {

     $counter2 = 1;
     while ( $counter2 <= $maxInArrays ) {
       if ( !isset ($arSelection[$counter1][$counter2]) ) {
         $arSelection[$counter1][$counter2] = '';
       }
       $counter2++;
     }
     $counter1++;
   }
   return $arSelection;
}

$radioGroupDefaultValues['1']['2'] = 'checked';
$radioGroupDefaultValues['2']['1'] = 'checked';
$radioGroupDefaultValues['3']['1'] = 'checked';

$radioGroup = assignValues (3, 2, $radioGroupDefaultValues);

--------------------------------------------------------
And the output show with var_dump ($radioGroup)
--------------------------------------------------------

array(3) {
   [1]=>
   array(2) {
     [2]=>
     string(7) "checked"
     [1]=>
     string(0) ""
   }
   [2]=>
   array(2) {
     [1]=>
     string(7) "checked"
     [2]=>
     string(0) ""
   }
   [3]=>
   array(2) {
     [1]=>
     string(7) "checked"
     [2]=>
     string(0) ""
   }
}

Now I have a big form with 50 radio buttons in 10 groups of 5 radio 
buttons. I didn't benchmark this function, it seems that it run well, 
but if there is a better way to do it, I'd like to hear it.

TIA

Emmanuel,

Like yourself, I have been a big fan of multidimensional arrays (MDA) in
PHP. One of my favorite uses is in using an MDA to hold product information
or perhaps a special price which goes into effect if the correct "code" used
in "unlocking" the array.  For example,

consider an array like this

promo[product_code][promo_code][domestic_price][foreign_price][source_code]

and in PHP you build it like this

$promo['abc']['123']=array('pdprice'=>167,'pfprice'=>197,'src_cde'=>'abc123'
);

You can see that the promo_code, '123' works as a key to unlocking the
special pricing and source code that should be used on the order.  Any value
for the promo_cde other than '123' and the value of pdprice will be null.

Yes, you could do this via a database, but we didn't feel the effort in
building the additional needed table maintenace modules worth it when merely
adding and deleting entries to the $promo array was so easy.

I haven't noticed this being slow, but in one of the NYPHP monthly meetings
I remember that MDAs were to be avoided for performance reasons.  I think it
was Dan Cowgill of Community Connect, but I may be mistaken.  Does anyone
else remember this being discussed?

Mike

Subject: Forms & Refresh Question & General Form Security
Message-ID: <385398.1052926198269.JavaMail.nobody@misspiggy.psp.pas.earthlink.net>

Hey All,

I wanted to start by saying how useful I find these mailing lists.  Although this is the first time that I'm submitting a question, I have found following the threads from other people's questions very valuable as I move into becoming an intermediate PHPer.

That said, I have a question regarding forms and protecting them against browser refreshes.  I have written a PHP program that emails a user's password to their registered email address upon request.  The main program looks like this:

	//HARVEST VARIABLES
	$query_msg = $_POST['query_msg'];
	$login = $_POST['login'];
	$email = $_POST['email'];
	
	//MAIN
	if (!empty($query_msg) && $query_msg != 'Password Found') { #Skip MySQL query first time form is called & after password found
		GetData();
	}

	$query_msg != 'Password Found' # Leave form only when successful
		? ShowForm() # Display the form
		: ShowSuccess($login,$email); # Show Success

~GetData() goes to a MySQL database and sets the global variable $query_msg equal to 'Password Found' if a query on their login name or email matches, and then sends an email to their address with their password.
~ShowForm() sets up an HTML form with either login or email passed (user's submission choice) and sends along $query_msg with it as a hidden input type.
~ShowSuccess() is a general message that displays when the password is found.

The problem is that someone could tinker around to find a valid user name, then keep hitting refresh and send dozens (or more) emails to that user.  GetData() is not skipped because a refresh brings back $query_msg from $_POST (which is the previous value of $query_msg) and not the global variable value of 'Password Found'.

Is there a way to set the variable directly in $_POST so that it will pass back the a newer value upon refresh?  Or is there a way to have the program call itself again and pass new POSTed variables?

***I realized setting this form up that there are probably a dozen other ways a malicious user could try to break any form.  Does there exist anywhere a "Safest Form Practices" document?  I'm sure there are other security issues that I'm not aware of that need to be guarded against.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Erik

I'm not sure how compliant this is to HTML specifications, but one
useful thing you can do is use arrays in form variables, for instance:

<input type="text" name="array[test]" value="">

When you post this, $_POST['array'] will be a populated array.
I have found this useful when you have some sort of multiple select.
You can have 15 check boxes with the name="option[<some unique id
here>]" and then you just get an array of all of the select options to
loop through.

I'm not sure if this would speed anything up (it may make it even make
it a bit slower) but it does provide a small amount of convenience.

What if you set up your form processor to redirect to either the form or
success?  The browser would never actaully see the form processor
script, and therefore a refresh wouldn't do anything.

As far as limiting password emails, could you possibly put a pass_sent
(datetime) field in the user's table and only send if the pass_sent is a
half hour old or older?

#Skip MySQL query first time form is called & after password found
		GetData();
	}

	$query_msg != 'Password Found' # Leave form only when successful
		? ShowForm() # Display the form
		: ShowSuccess($login,$email); # Show Success

~GetData() goes to a MySQL database and sets the global variable
$query_msg equal to 'Password Found' if a query on their login name or
email matches, and then sends an email to their address with their
password.
~ShowForm() sets up an HTML form with either login or email passed
(user's submission choice) and sends along $query_msg with it as a
hidden input type.
~ShowSuccess() is a general message that displays when the password is
found.

The problem is that someone could tinker around to find a valid user
name, then keep hitting refresh and send dozens (or more) emails to that
user.  GetData() is not skipped because a refresh brings back $query_msg
from $_POST (which is the previous value of $query_msg) and not the
global variable value of 'Password Found'.

Is there a way to set the variable directly in $_POST so that it will
pass back the a newer value upon refresh?  Or is there a way to have the
program call itself again and pass new POSTed variables?

***I realized setting this form up that there are probably a dozen other
ways a malicious user could try to break any form.  Does there exist
anywhere a "Safest Form Practices" document?  I'm sure there are other
security issues that I'm not aware of that need to be guarded against.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Erik

All,
On the matter of form refresh problems, I've found that submitting to a
second script works well.
----------------------------
"page_with_form.php"

submits to

"form_processor.php"

which redirects to

"page_with_form.php?status=(success|failure)"
----------------------------

So form_processor.php is strictly for backend stuff, it never prints
anything. The last line would be a header("Location....").

This way a user only ever sees page_with_form.php in his/her browser, and
reloading does no harm and does not re-submit data.

Also, BTW, a kind of useful Javascript tip is to set the onClick() event of
the submit button to 'this.disabled=true' -- this way the user cannot click
the button twice, and they get nice visual feedback.

I'm not sure how compliant this is to HTML specifications, but one
useful thing you can do is use arrays in form variables, for instance:

<input type="text" name="array[test]" value="">

When you post this, $_POST['array'] will be a populated array. I have
found this useful when you have some sort of multiple select. You can
have 15 check boxes with the name="option[<some unique id
here>]" and then you just get an array of all of the select options to
loop through.

I'm not sure if this would speed anything up (it may make it even make
it a bit slower) but it does provide a small amount of convenience.

You do realize you're basically trusting the user with the value of status,
right? I hope you're not using that for anything important.

Thanks, that's a good solution too. But in the way I'm using PHP for 
this project, its more work for me. The designers really need to 
access the HTML markup and the content. This is not to say that it 
could be done with what you are proposing, but, I'll need to add an 
interface to it so one could change the strings used for the 
questions, and an easy way for the designer to change the HTML markup.

Cheers

As David mentioned, __FILE__ and __LINE__ are handy.  In my SQL class, the 
first two parameters to each method is $File and $Line.  So, when my 
scripts call one of the methods, I use __FILE__ and __LINE__.  Therefore, 
my class knows where in my scripts I called the method from, so I can go 
to the appropriate location and fix the problem.

Perhaps a better treatment for this would be
	foreach (array_keys($_POST) as $key ) { $$key=$_POST[$key]; }

I do this too, but instead of going back to the same page with status, I
send them to two different pages.

First, can't we improve this with session variable instead of $_GET
variable?
Second, you can always check for a valid $HTTP_REFERRER, if the user change
the value in the address bar then $HTTP_REFERRER will not be set, then we
can do this:
	if ((!isset($HTTP_REFERER))) { exit("access denied"); }

Ah that's nice. I used often this, but not in PHP, but with UserTalk, 
which is the scripting language for Frontier/Radio UserLand.

Well, thinking more about it, I though that this might be more 
readable, and it might be faster too.

function assignValues2 ($groupID, $boutonID, $arSelection) {

	if ( isset ($arSelection[$groupID][$boutonID]) ) {
		return $arSelection[$groupID][$boutonID];
	} else {
		return '';
	}

}


$radioGroupDefaultValues = array ();
$radioGroupDefaultValues['1']['2'] = 'checked';
$radioGroupDefaultValues['2']['1'] = 'checked';
$radioGroupDefaultValues['3']['1'] = 'checked';

<hr>
<form>
Are you ugly?
Yes
<input type="radio" name="choice_1" value="1"

Subject: Weird problem with PHP and MYSQL on IIS
Message-ID: <Law14-OE60YZkxOjmfC0000d07d@hotmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm running into a weird problem with one of our clients' win2k servers. When I run php without doing any db calls or when I run mysql from the command line interface on a win2k server, they are working just fine. But when I run a php script connecting to mysql, it's like 20 times slower than my own win2k server box. The boxes are almost the same in terms of hardware. I got almost the same results when running php or mysql separetely but when I combine them, it just crawls. Any ideas?

Thanks

Does anyone know where some good wireless hot spots are in Manhattan? I will be
all over looking at apartments and doing interviews, and I'd like to be able to
drop in a Starbucks or something and keep up with email, etc.

Thanks for your help.

... don't know exactly, but have what does your mysql_connect(...)
command look like?  are you using host names instead of IP address?
If so, maybe the DNS is taking a while to resolve, which is probably
because it is failing to resolve by one of your DNS servers.  If
this is it, you could try hard-coding the IP address into your
mysql_connect() command, OR hard-code the IP address and hostname
into your winnt\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts file -- which should
supercede the DNS lookups.

	If you need use the default mysql_connect() call -- with
no arguments -- you can set the default DB hostname in your
PHP.INI file... wherever that may be.

	(...just a thought)


Best, George.

Message-ID: <BAE80D78.BC64%jfreeman@amnh.org>

First off, thanks to the many people who helped me out with my previous
question about making it possible for people to upload images.  I'm not
there quite yet but when I get there I'm sure the answers I received will be
incredibly helpful.  Thanks again.

I'm working on the same project.. in brief, a scientist has about 1000
specimens of the same kind of thing and wants to make a database containing
a survey of these 1000 specimens.  The main table in the database is the
'specimen'table, but that table has lots of fields for the 'id' number of
records in related tables.

In most cases, it's clear from the form whether or not I need to build a
table to relate to the main 'specimen' table but in some cases, it's not so
clear.

Here's an example of what I mean:

in the form, there's an area called 'structural stability'.  Someone filling
out the form can select for a few radio button:

-----------snip-----------------

<input type="radio" name="structural stability" value="stable">stable

<input type="radio" name="structural stability" value="slightly
unstable">slightly unstable

etc...

---------------snip-------------

in addition to 4 possible radio buttons, there are also 2 checkboxes
associated with the idea of 'structural stability':

---------------snip-------------

<input type="checkbox" name="structural stability" value="inadequate storage
support"> inadequate storage support

<input type="checkbox" name="structural stability" value="current insect
activity">   current insect activity

---------------snip-------------

so, here's my question:

right now, i have the name of all the radio buttons and the checkboxes as
'structural stability'

i'm not sure, however, how to handle this on the database side of things.
Should I give the checkboxes different names and their own tables?

I'm a little confused at the moment and would love someone with more
experience to shine some light on the path...

Thanks in advance..

And rest assured that once I'm done with this project I should be in shape
to begin offering up some advice of my own to new newbies.

Thanks!

Joshua

It would seem that if the structural stability choices are mutually
exclusive, then they would go into a single database column. The same
would apply to the checkboxes.

Hi Joshua,

The structural stability field should hold a number (1-x).  For 
checkboxes, I usually just add yn columns.

So, as an example, your table might have the following fields:

id (mediumint 5)
txtImageName (tinytext)
intStability (tinyint 1)
ynStorageSupport (tinyint 1)
ynInsectActivity (tinyint 1)

The intStability field can hold numbers corresponding to the activity (1 
for "stable", 2 for "slightly stable", etc.). The yn fields hold either 
a 0 or a 1 - with checkboxes, either something is true (checked) or it's 
false (not checked).

I can very quickly query the table at this point to get the information 
I need (for image 2, what was the level of its stability?  was there 
insect activity? was there adequate storage support?)

Be careful in naming, of course - the word "inadequate" can create a 
double-negative connotation if you use ynInadequateSupport (which is why 
I chose ynStorageSupport instead of its negative).

Hope that helps,

+gadhra+

You got it - "yn" is just an identifier I use to mean "yes/no".  I use 
them in forms and in database fields so I know what type of value to 
expect in the data field just by looking at the database structure.

So, if I have a table with an entry of:
ynOrderedPizza  

I can either expect a 0 ("No") or a 1 ("Yes")  in that column ie. either 
the person ordered a pizza, or they didn't.  To translate this to a 
checkbox, either they checked the box for "Did you order a pizza?", or 
they didn't.

Fittingly on the PHP list, here's a small php script I wrote
that plots wifi points on a aerial map.

http://www.omnistep.com/wifi/wifiplot/

Click to zoom in.
You might want to increase the map width
(controls at the bottom of the image)

Oh, also, I hate to say this, but use IE or Opera browser. It seems to 
be broken
when using the most recent version of Mozilla.

I got into the conversation a bit late and tried to read through the
thread so here's my basic understanding of the situation.

You've got a ton of specimens. Specimens are "classified" by structural
stability, etc. so that each of these "attributes" are specific to a
specimen. I would handle it as follows:

tblSpecimen (specimen table - the "parent" table)
SP_ID - autoincrement ID number
frkST_ID - int field - foreign key to tlkpStability SP_sSpecimenName
varchar field 
(Add'l fields as needed)

Things like stability, etc., should go in lookup tables...for example,

tlkpStability (each row has its own ID number and a description) 
ST_ID autoincrement 
ST_sStability 

Instead of radio buttons you use a dropdown. That way, if they have four
choices of structural stability at this point in time but...after
examining 100 specimens they realize they need a fifth choice, it can be
added to the table and it would automatically appear in the dropdown.
You wouldn't have to reprogram your form by adding an additional radio
button.

If you have only two possible choices for a particular specimen, that
could go into tblSpecimen. I use lookup tables when there are 3 choices
or more (not that they couldn't also be in tblSpecimen... however...if
the choices could change over time...using a separate lookup table makes
life easier).

Try here:   http://www.nodedb.com/unitedstates/ny/newyork/?   as well 
as here http://www.nycwireless.net/  ..   I am amazed how often I can 
connect to an open office wireless network.   No security.  I sat in a 
Starbucks on broadway and could connect to two different networks 
freely.  I was at a clients apartment who had just purchased  an 
airport he thought I set it up but I was using his neighbors system.  
So try you're often surprised.

Hi Jeff,

this area of 'structural stability' is one of several areas in the survey
form.

with this, and some other parts of the survey, you can select 1 of four or
five options (radio buttons) as a value but also, for any given row/specimen
there may also be one or two additional bits of information that should be
part of the value for that specimen (these are the checkboxes...)

does this change your thinking at all?

J.

So.. there's an area on the form:

Surface clean:  [ ] brush  [ ] vacuum  ([ ] == checkbox)

so.. for any record/specimen, it will either be:

1) no brush no vacuum
2) yes brush no vacuum
3) yes brush yes vacuum
4) no brush yes vacuum

so, in the database, do i just make these two different yn field?  ynbrush
and ynvacuum, tinyint(1)... ?

even though they're both associated with the notion of 'surface clean' ?

You got it - if they're checkboxes (like you have), they should be:
ynBrush
ynVacuum

If you're interested in doing whether or not something's surface is 
clean, I would do:
ynSurfaceClean

and in your code write:

if ($_POST['brush'] || $_POST['vacuum']) {
    $sql = "update tbl set ynSurfaceClean = 1";
} else {
   $sql = "update tbl set ynSurfaceClean = 0";
}

(commiting it to the database, of course)

Subject: one more issue...
Message-ID: <BAE8241D.BC89%jfreeman@amnh.org>

so, the very next 'area' after 'surface clean: [ ] brush  [ ] vacuum' is

'Structural Treatment' which contains  4 different checkboxes plus a <input
type='text' name='other'> for something in addition to or different from the
4 checkboxes, any of which may or may not be checked...

how do I handle something like this in the main specimen table if these are
all under the heading 'structural treatment' ?  with some kind of table
devoted to 'structural treatment' right?

that would be something like this:

table structural treatment

st_id 
ynReattachElements
ynStablizeBreaksFractures
ynRemovePins
ynPointSmallerElements
other

and then I reference st_id in my main 'specimen' table, right?

but... ok..

in this case the only possibilites are:

y y y y other
y n n n other
y y n n other
y y y n other
n n n n other

accessible?

Subject: form confusion
Message-ID: <200305142056.h4EKuKAP011761@gw00.com>

Joshua, here are some basic thoughts about FORMS and PHP
as they may relate to your examples:

	1/ Groups of radio buttons should have the same "NAME"
	attribute, because that's what links them together to be
	a one-of-many selector.  Also, in your PHP script, you want 
	to read the one single value result of the radio group --
	in your case "structural stability" is the name.
	These work very similarly to a <SELECT> list (*without*
	the MULTIPLE attribute) with <OPTIONS> for each option.

	2/ Space characters in form field names is sometimes
	problematic... better to stay with alphanumeric and
	underscore if possible.  This is especially true if
	you want your form field names to match up with names of
	your database columns.  Databases usually only allow
	A-Za-z0-9_ for column names.

	3/ Unlike radio buttons, checkboxes should each have
	*unique* names.  E.g.:

	<INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX NAME="inadequate_storage" VALUE=1>...
	<INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX NAME="insect_activity" VALUE=1>...

	The "VALUE" HTML attribute should probably just be "1",
	so that you can easily check whether an input element is
	checked or not, e.g:

	if ( @$_POST['inadequate_storage'] ) {
		/*** handle "checked" ***/
	}
	if ( @$_POST['insect_activity'] ) {
		/*** handle "checked" ***/
	}

	(The at-sign in front suppresses warnings when the checkbox
	is not set (and error_reporting is E_ALL).)

	4/ If you have a group of "related" checkboxes, for example
	a question like "Check all that apply...", you might want
	to use an input array as follows:  set the NAME attributes
	to all the same thing; put an empty square-brackets on the
	end of each name, to make it an array; set the VALUE attribute
	of each one to a unique value, e.g.:

	Bands I Like:
	<INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX NAME="bands[]" VALUE="Santana">Santana
	<INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX NAME="bands[]" VALUE="n'sync">n'Sync
	<INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX NAME="bands[]" VALUE="John Tesh">John Tesh
	<INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX NAME="bands[]" VALUE="Ween">Ween

	Then you would get the user's checked values very easily from
	PHP:

	$checked_values_array = $_POST['bands'];

	Or if you want to print them out:
	foreach ( $_POST['bands'] as $band ) {
		echo "He likes $band<BR>\
";
	}

	Related Checkboxes work very similarly to a <SELECT MULTIPLE>
	element with <OPTIONS> for each option you can check.

	It's FUN WITH FORMS, not FORM CONFUSION!!!


	5/ There are so many different ways to do the database
	side for radio buttons and checkboxes.  One main issue is,
	will one "entry cell" have exactly one value, or possibly
	multiple simultaneous values?  If it's exactly one, you
	can simply store the result as a text field, or if it's
	yes/no, maybe as an enumerated type or integer, e.g.:

		text
		enum('YES','NO') NOT NULL
		enum('Y')
		int NOT NULL
	
	If there might be multiple simultaneous choices, like the
	bands example above, then you might want to create a new
	table with the user ID (or specimen ID) in the first column,
	and the value in the second.  The results might come to look
	like this table:

		+-----+----------------+
		| ID  | band           |
		+-----+----------------+
		|  3  | John Tesh      |
		| 19  | John Tesh      |
		|  6  | Ween           |
		|  6  | John Tesh      |
		| 14  | Santana        |
		|  9  | n'Sync         |
		| 14  | John Tesh      |
		+-----+----------------+
	
	This way, each "ID" can have as many "bands" as it wants.

	A much cheesier, but somewhat simpler way is to hard-code
	each band name as a field into the main table, e.g.

	+----+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
	| ID | stuff    | likes_santana | likes_nsync | likes_tesh | likes_ween |
	+----+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
	|  3 | foo      | NO            | NO          | YES        | NO         |
	|  6 | bar      | NO            | NO          | YES        | YES        |
	|  9 | baz      | NO            | YES         | NO         | NO         |
	| 14 | quux     | YES           | NO          | YES        | NO         |
	| 19 | xyzzy    | NO            | NO          | YES        | NO         |
	+----+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

	It's FUN WITH DATABASES.

	6/ One other database consideration is maybe some users want to
	download the entire database into a spreadsheet or MS Access or
	something.  E.g. the users there might rather see the results in the
	cheesier method above, if they're more into looking at single
	huge spreadsheets.  Or if they like Access, they might like the
	other way.  Or maybe you matter the most, because YOU have to
	write the PHP queries to display the results -- so do what's
	easiest for you to work with.

	7/ If you're not sure about what to do, don't worry you may
	likely want to change it later after you get it.  Just make it
	work and get it done fast.  PHP should very helpful with that.
	Even with advanced projects, the first version is usually not
	meant to be optimized; that usually comes later -- after you
	have thousands of users.


Best, George.

They're all in my MySQL database.

I'm not sure where the points came from.
Some of them were mailed to me by contributors who
drove around running Netstubler or Kismet.

The Boston points are all from 2 individuals.

Around here in NJ, roughly 90% of the AP's are
wide open, simply because people have not enabled
any encryption when they plug it into their home networks.

Doesn't really change my thinking...however...the question is how
normalized should the data be (or even need to be). For example, a
lookup table as described below (tlkpStability) adds a fair amount of
flexibility but, depending on how far you go with normalizing data, it
can also make queries a bit more complex. 

The real questions concerning the approach to take come down to:

	a. Is this an application you've got to knock out real fast and
which will never be used again except in this particular instance? If
yes, you can go with a "fast and dirty" approach. However, applications
sometimes take on a life of their own and this "quicky" application may
blossom into something you have to maintain regularly...if that happens
you'll regret the "fast and dirty" approach.

	b. If there will be any reporting based on the data (I assume
there will be), will a single table allow you to partition the data as
needed? The answer may be yes.

Hi Jeff,

this area of 'structural stability' is one of several areas in the
survey form.

with this, and some other parts of the survey, you can select 1 of four
or five options (radio buttons) as a value but also, for any given
row/specimen there may also be one or two additional bits of information
that should be part of the value for that specimen (these are the
checkboxes...)

does this change your thinking at all?

Subject: Highlighting keywords 
Message-ID: <3EC2DCF3.8090701@webstew.com>

If I wanted to print just the keywords the user typed into a form, 
within the query results, say in a red font, but leave the rest of the 
data from the table cell in black, is there a way of inserting some 
logic inside the print statement within an SQL query to isolate only the 
matched word that was typed in.  

Let's say I typed in "dynamics" in the keyword field of the form and my 
results were lists of titles such as "Intensity dependence and transient 
dynamics of donor-- acceptor pair recombination in ZnO thin films grown 
on (001) silicon"  I want only the word "dynamics" to be red and the 
rest of the title to be black, is this possible with a MySQL query?

Thanks everyone.  I used a combination of things suggested, some other
online suggestions,  and added to it my further tinkering.

Here's what I found (and all seems to be working well):
Just using another file on success doesn't solve the security problem.
A malicious user needs to merely hit the BACK button & then REFRESH to
get the form to resubmit.  Doing that combo rapidly and you can resubmit
the form (query database & send another success email) dozens of times
in a couple of seconds.  I added a session variable--turns out to be
very easy--to track a successful submission.  On success a plain HTML
page is loaded.

I hadn't found a full satisfactory solution online, so I've pasted all
of the code below for anyone interested.  If anyone has suggestions for
improvement, please send them along; especially if they improve the
security of the form.  (I know, I shouldn't have used global variables,
but they were convenient.)

P.S. I also ran across an interesting Javascript solution where you can
remove the previous page from the browser's cache history.  There may be
another PHP header() command that could accomplish the same thing.
Anyone know?

Subject: Help with regex
Message-ID: <5694601.1053098841330.JavaMail.nobody@kermit.psp.pas.earthlink.net>

Hi people,

I am having problems doing a regex using ereg_replace
I am reading a file and when I find a line with  white space and <td width=123>
I want to remove these characters up to an including the '>'.
This is what a typical line looks like:
-----------------------------------------
   <td width="49">205</td>
   <td width="155">Asaro, Doreen</td>
   <td width="197">G.I.S.</td>
   <td width="42">&nbsp;</td>
----------------------------------------------

I have tried the following but it does not work
------------------------------------------
foreach($content as $line)
{
 $line = ereg_replace(".*>", "", $line);
 print "$i = $line <br>";
 $i++;
}
------------------------------------------

I also tried :
$line = ereg_replace(".*?>", "", $line);
To make sure that it does not remove the entire line when it finds the '>' in  "</td>"
but I get this error:
*Warning*: ereg_replace() [function.ereg-replace <http://www.php.net/function.ereg-replace>]: REG_BADRPT: in *c:\\program files\\apache group\\apache\\htdocs\\php\\readphone.php* on line *35*

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Nestor

We (NYPHP) are looking for one, too :)

So far I haven't been able to find anything nice.  Our current job board,
despite steadfast efforts by Sklar, can't offer what we'd like.  I believe
Chris is working on a better system, and this will be a continuing Open
Source project of NYPHP.

Best,

H

Sure thing, thank you!  Chris S. has been making strides in getting the new

As you probably realized, this is too greedy.  The reason is because ".*"
is matching ANY character, including ">" so it goes through the whole line
until it gets to the final ">"  This can be tweaked a tad so all
characters except ">" are 

    $line = ereg_replace('^[^>]+>', '', $line);

Also notice the anchoring of the expression to the start of the line to 
avoid the expression repeating it's actions on subsequent >'s, and the use 
of single quotes since no variables are in the expressions.


> $line = ereg_replace(".*?>", "", $line);

You're on the right track, but "?" is for preg expressions.  So, another 
option is converting it to a preg function:

   $line = preg_replace('/^.*?>/', '', $line);

Enjoy,

"*?" is an bad combination. That's why you get the error.
Perhaps you are looking for something like "[[:space:]]?<[tT][dD][^>]*>"

Yes, good suggestion.

The Referer header is not required by the HTTP specification, even in 1.1, so
relying on that is not necessarily a good idea. You will basically render your
application useless to any Web client that does not provide this *optional*
HTTP header. If you want to do that, it's fine, so long as you are taking that
caveat into consideration.

To answer your question, all the major browsers support http referer, but
the real issue is that the browser sends the server this data, and there is
no way you can verify it. The cURL library even allows you to send any data
you want as the http refer string.

I wouldn't be to worried if you're using this for something like a
guestbook, but if %100 reliable security is needed, you need to use
something else.

What you can do is encode the current time stamp (with something strong) and
pass that as a variable.
That way you can tell if someone tries to use an old string.

My experience with that is to use Javascript to display the user machine's local time (the Javascript asks the browser to display what it sees as the local time as dictated by the Operating System...so if the OS has the wrong time, it will show the wrong time.

Message-ID: <7213432.1053118519689.JavaMail.nobody@beaker.psp.pas.earthlink.net>

Dan et all,

Thanks for your help, I was able to do what I wanted 
Using the following regex
 $_ =~ s/.*[^>]+>(.*[^<])<\\/td>/\\1/gi;

I decide to use perl instead PHP because it was a lot easier reading the files in perl with the "while(<FILE>)", but I prefer PHP for creating web pages.
When I tried using php
-----------------------
33 $content = file($myfile);                #readfile into array
34 foreach($content as $line_num => $line) 
35 {
36   $a = "/.*[^>]+>(.*[^<])<\\/td>/\\1/";    #reg expression
37   $line = preg_replace($a, '$1', $line); #replace
38 }
------------------------------
I still get an error:
Warning: Unknown modifier '' in c:\\program files\\apache group\\apache\\htdocs\\php\\readphone.php on line 37

My problem is solved, but I wish what was causing the error message.

Thnaks again to all,

Nestor :-)


Is ther an easy way to read a file in PHP like there is in perl

As you probably realized, this is too greedy.  The reason is because ".*"
is matching ANY character, including ">" so it goes through the whole line
until it gets to the final ">"  This can be tweaked a tad so all
characters except ">" are 

    $line = ereg_replace('^[^>]+>', '', $line);

Also notice the anchoring of the expression to the start of the line to 
avoid the expression repeating it's actions on subsequent >'s, and the use 

of single quotes since no variables are in the expressions.


> $line = ereg_replace(".*?>", "", $line);

You're on the right track, but "?" is for preg expressions.  So, another 
option is converting it to a preg function:

   $line = preg_replace('/^.*?>/', '', $line);

Enjoy,

Subject: Highlighting keywords in query
Message-ID: <3EC4CFF9.6070002@webstew.com>

If I wanted to print just the keywords the user typed into a form, 
within the query results, say in a red font, but leave the rest of the 
data from the table cell in black, is there a way of inserting some 
logic inside the print statement within an SQL query to isolate only the 
matched word that was typed in. 

Let's say I typed in "dynamics" in the keyword field of the form and my 
results were lists of titles such as "Intensity dependence and transient 
dynamics of donor-- acceptor pair recombination in ZnO thin films grown 
on (001) silicon"  I want only the word "dynamics" to be red and the 
rest of the title to be black, is this possible with a MySQL query?

Thanks,
Dennis

There are probably existing tutorials out there about this.  I haven't
done this personally.  But, I can think of two ways to do it.

One is in the SQL query.  For example, MySQL has a REPLACE() function.

The other is a preg_replace() the resulting text before you output it.  
I'd probably go this way.  Get your search terms into a string.  There are 
lots of ways to do this, depending on how your searh terms are initially 
acquired/defined, but here's one:

   $Terms = implode('|', $SearchTerms);

Then put the terms into a regex:

   $out = preg_replace("/($Terms)/i", 
                       '<b class="term">\\\\1</b>', $out);

Then use style sheets to make the "color" of the class "term" red.  This 
has better cross platform performance than <font> and uses less space:

   <style type="text/css">
      b.term {color: red}
   </style>

Note: the above code is off the top of my head and hasn't been tested.

Enjoy,

How secure is a MySQL database?  I'm putting together a new site (with
individual logins), and I want to market the site on the basis that their
data will be secure, and no one can hack into it.  Can I say this with using
MySQL?

Certainly.

That said, MySQL's security depends on proper setup and use of it's
permissions system, as is the case with any other database.  And, if you will
only be accessing the DB from the local system, set MySQL not to listen on a
public socket with the disable-tcp configuration option in my.cnf.

An advantage that MySQL has is it's Open Source development model.  While I
realize that some would suggest Open Source is a security weakness,
especially in MySQL's I don't think this is so.  There are thousands of eyes
on the MySQL codebase, constantly auditing it and trying to weed out any
issues.

Not in PHP that I know of.  Typically, an entire file will either be tab or
comma seperated, not a particular record, and a parser is written to handle a
particular case.  Then, when processing a given file the fact if it's using
tabs, commas or even fixed-width is specified, since trying to guess from the
file's contents could lead to unexpected results.

There were security issues with this command because it would allow MySQL to
potentially read any file (/etc/shadow for instance).

Peter,

I am assuming you are using phpMyAdmin --
Try this: when you export the data use data and structure and click 
'add drop table' .
(Copy your table first of course, before trying this --
Or use a test table...)

Is there a way to get the logged in user name under Windows 2000 with PHP?

I can't seem to find my my.cnf file.  I know mysql is up and running.
phpmyadmin can access it and all.  How do I figure out where the my.cnf file

Do you have any other security advice?

if you would like to see what i'm working on at www.keitz.org, 
below the banner i have some 'news' i retrieve from a mysql database.
i'm trying to do something that i'm sure is done on everysite... the news is getting overwhelming for the homepage so i  thought i'd put a link to the 'archives'.

in order to use the code (sql_calc_found_rows) i wanted to use i had to upgrade .... finally i'm getting somewhere with the following code.

$query = "SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS DATE_FORMAT(Newsdate,'<CENTER>%W<BR>%D %M %Y %r</CENTER>'),
News FROM www_news ORDER BY NewsDate DESC limit 3;";

$result = mysql_query($query,$link);
if (!$result) {
die("<h2>!queryErr - error executing query.</h2><br>$query");
}

$sql_news_count = "SELECT FOUND_ROWS()";

$count_news_results = mysql_result (mysql_query ( $sql_news_count ),3);

//print "<B>News ($count_news_results):</B>";

<TH bgcolor="#A0A0A0" width="70%" nowrap>3 of <?print ($count_news_results);?> news articles</TH>
<TH bgcolor="#A0A0A0" width="15%" nowrap>Archives</TH>

<?


$AltColor ="#F0F0F0";


while ($field = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {

$Date =$field[0];
$News =$field[1];

print("<TR>");

print("<TD colspan=\\"3\\"bgcolor=\\"$AltColor\\"><CENTER><FONT color=\\"#0000A0\\">$Date<BR>$News</CENTER></TD>");
print("</TR>");

if ($AltColor == "#F0F0F0") {
$AltColor = "#E0E0E0";
}

else {
$AltColor = "#F0F0F0";
}

}


?>

SO...... i'm going to make an HREF for the word Archives to something like new1.php and then i need to somehow start a new starting reference point to display the news.  i know i have counted the total available news accurately because i got 11 when i put in the code  //print "<B>News ($count_news_results):</B>"; i guess i need to somehow define a variable that is equal to $count_news_results minus the three news articles i previously displayed.  but at somepoint i need a loop to end when i run out of news.  

i must be brain dead this morning....cuz i'm sure this is common code. thanks for any help you can offer.

regards,

deedee

The code I'd use would be something like this for the main page -- I'm 
not sure what FOUND_ROWS is, I've always used count on a column to find 
totals:

// set up the number to display on the main page:
$pagetotal= 3;

// get the total number of articles
$totalquery= "SELECT count(NewsDate) FROM www_news";
$totalresult= mysql_query($totalquery);
if ($array= mysql_fetch_row($totalresult)) $total= $array[0];

// display the first three
$query = "SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NewsDate,'<CENTER>%W<BR>%D %M %Y %r</CENTER>'),News FROM www_news ORDER BY NewsDate DESC LIMIT $pagetotal";
$result = mysql_query($query);
if (!$result) {
    die("<h2>!queryErr - error executing query.</h2><br>$query");
}

// use your while loop to print the news...
while ($array= mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
   etc. etc. etc.
}

// then for the link to the archives
if ($total > $pagetotal) {
    $archive= $total - $pagetotal;
    print "<a href='newsarchive.php?offset=$pagetotal'>news archive ($archive stories)</a>";
}



And in newsarchive.php you would use the offset you sent to build the query:

$offset= $_GET['offset'];
$query = "SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NewsDate,'<CENTER>%W<BR>%D %M %Y %r</CENTER>'),News FROM www_news ORDER BY NewsDate DESC LIMIT $offset, -1";
// the -1 means select from $offset to the end of the record set

Deedee:
Here's what I put in my left-side nav thing:

***

$news_query = "select topic, date from site_news order by date desc";
$news_result = @mysql_query( $news_query );

// Notice on next line, I assume that there's more than two news items

for( $i = 0; $i < 2; $i++ ) {
  $row = @mysql_fetch_assoc( $news_result );
    print "          <p><b>" . $row[ "topic" ] . "</b><br />"
        . date( "j M Y g:i a", strtotime( $row[ "date" ] ) )
  . "</p>\
";
}
print "          <p align=\\"left\\">";
print_link( "$docroot/news.php", "Read Site News..." );
print "</p>\
";

***

The assumption works because it's my site top to bottom.  YMMV.

The page news.php, which shows all the news, looks like this:

***

// Select all entries from site_news table
$news_query = "select * from site_news order by date desc";
$news_result = @mysql_query( $news_query );

// And display them
while( $row = @mysql_fetch_assoc( $news_result ) ) {
  print "<p class=\\"main\\"><font color=\\"blue\\"><large><b>"
      . $row[ "topic" ] . "</b></large></font> <small>[ "
      . date( "j M Y g:i a", strtotime( $row[ "date" ] ) )
      . " ]</small></p>\
";
  print "<p class=\\"main\\">" . $row[ "news" ] . "</p>\
";
}

***

BTW, just so you're not confused, this is code from my devel site.
The live site actually displays the first two items on the front page,
not just headlines and dates, and doesn't display anything in the nav
bar.

HTH!

It can be a bit tricky, and really depends on your OS and how MySQL was
setup.  If you used a RedHat RPM, for instance, then my.cnf should be in
/etc.  If not, you just need to create one there.  If you've compiled from
source or installed the binary package mysql.com then my.cnf isn't created by
default so you can just create it in either /etc/ or in your data directory. 
If this is Windows, sorry, I have no idea :)  (but typically, you can create
the my.cnf in your data directory and it'll get picked up).

> Do you have any other security advice?

Well, for instance, if you're setting up a shared server, where multiple
people will have DBs, some of the privacy/etc settings are nice
(http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Privileges_options.html).  And, in general, just
be diligent with giving permissions, trying to the most restrictive and
becoming more lenient from there.

I'm not sure if I understand 100%, but maybe all you need is a SELECT
statement?  Something like:

SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE col1='name'

If you need to restrict the results more, you can of course add tests to the
WHERE clause.

I'm assuming you mean with PHP running under Windows 2000 as the server
environment?  If so, then phpinfo(); should give you a broad list of
available environment variables, one of which being the user that owns the
process.

thank you everyone who offered assistance, the archive/more news
functionality is in production!

on a side note,  SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS (using mysql 4.0.12) determines
the number of rows in a query without looping through and counting
everything...very helpful when the database contains hundreds or thousands
of records.  The number of rows can then be retrieved with SELECT
FOUND_ROWS().

Thanks to all forthe regex help
I actualy was trying to accomplish this in PHP but
I ended up doing it in perl.  It was easier reading the file
itself.

 $_ =~ s/.*[^>]+>(.*[^<])<\\/td>/\\1/gi;

Thanks again,

Comments:

1.  The binding operator (=~) should be used.
2.  If $_ is used, then it's redundant and can be omitted.
3.  It's broken.  The following demonstrates:

  $_ = '<td width="10">this</td><td with="10">that</td>';
  s/<td .*>(.*)<\\/td>//gi;
  print $1;

One isn't installed by default, necessarily.  What does come with the
distribution, at least on Windows, is a set of sample files.  They're in
the root of your MySQL direcory, with names like "my-small.cnf" and
"my-huge.cnf."  Copy an appropriate one to the appropriate location: /etc
or c:\\.  It's also a good idea to put a blank one in your mysql/data
directory, just to make sure a malicious one doesn't get put there.  Now,
MAKE SURE the file permissions on these files don't allow anyone but the
system administrator to change their contents.

I stay away from third party convenience tools like that.  phpmyadmin has 
had some very basic vulnerabilities.  Plus, I imagine one can store 
passwords in a file


> Do you have any other security advice?

Put your database username/password in one separate file which you then
include from the rest of your scripts.  Then, place that file in a secure
location, preferably not in the document root of the web server.  Then
make sure permissions on that file only allow authorized persons to view,
let alone, heaven forbid, edit it.

Finally, the default MySQL distribution has several security openings.  Do 
the following queries to close them.

   delete from user where Host='%';
   delete from user where User='';
   delete from db where Host='%';
   update user set User='NewRootName',
      Password=password('NewPassword') where User='root';
   flush privileges; 

I've got an execllent tutorial regarding MySQL installation.  While it 
focuses on Windows machines, there are lots of general tips in there too.  
It's on line at http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/mybasic.htm

No.  But you could make a guess by doing explode(',', $line) and 
explode("\

array elements.

As Hans suggested, a file should be in one format.

I don't believe there is one directly.  You could try to rig something up
using mysql_fetch_array().  That returns an array containing values of
both assciative and enumerated keys.  Then you might be able to find your
answer using array_search().  Hmm...  Actually, create two arrays.  One
enumerated.  One associative.  Find the value from the associative.  Then
use that value as the needle in the enumerated array "haystack" via
array_search().

But, after all that's said, I don't really see the point.  Why are you 
trying to do this?  Sounds like you're creating a problem or attacking 
something in a way that may be better approachced from another direction.

Why would you want to do it in the query? Formatting, like color, 
should really be done in the presentation layer. For my purposes I 
create 10 classes in my style sheets so that I can hilight up 10 search 
words in different colors. I then do a search and replace on the words 
so that "dynamics" would be changed to <span 
class="searchword1">dynamics</span>. This won't interfere with any of 
you other formatting or color schemes you have in place.

First, thanks to everyone who answered my last salvo of questions.  I look
forward to moving down to NY this summer so I can start meeting you in
person at NYPHP meetings...


This one is more of a MySQL question than a PHP question but here goes..

I'm creating a LAMP app. for a scientist who needs to gather a crapload of
information about a collection of scientific specimens.

The main table ('specimens') has 61 fields.

For fields such as 'species_id' what will go in there is simply the id
number referencing information from a lookup table containing 20 or 30
species names, each with an id number.

(species_id smallint(6) NOT NULL default '0')

For fields such as 'priority' or 'condition' I'm thinking of using type
'enum':

priority enum('1','2','3','4') NOT NULL default '1',
gen_condition enum('good','fair','poor','very poor') NOT NULL default
'good'...

Is this alright?..

or.. should I do the same thing with 'priority' and 'gen_condition' that I
do with 'species_id' ?...

An additional question:

there are NUMEROUS questions in the survey that ask the surveyor to choose
between 'high - moderate - low' ... in reference to various different
parameters in the survey.

do i have just ONE table that looks up 'high', 'moderate', 'low' (like the
species lookup table which has two fields- species_id and species_name) or
do I make different lookup tables for 'high', 'moderate', 'low'... once for
each question in the survey asking "how much incidence of blah-blah do you
see ? high? medium? low?"

I hope my questions are clear.  I look forward to some guidance.

Thanks!

J.

Well, knowing how scientists (I don't know any, but watch the Science
Channel) they will ineveitably add 'very good', 'average', and so on.  While
this isn't nessecarily a bad thing, it is ineveitable.

> or.. should I do the same thing with 'priority' and 'gen_condition' that I

Personally, I would.  I've played with the enum and set column types, and
always ended up going back to regular columns for various reasons (using
certain functions on columns, getting the values of a particular column, more
flexibility with joins, etc).  That said, set or enum columns certainly
aren't verboten, IMHO.

I would go with just a single table.

Additionally, when I have a lot of options to select from, and the data is
all generally the same, I like to use just a single generic table, consisting
of an auto_increment id, possibly timestamp when the choice was added,
another int field to determine type of the row (a species, rating, etc) and
the value itself.  When delivering some research software for NYUCD I use a
single table to over 30+ types of oddball info and it worked very nicely.

Best,

Dear J.,

	According to a somewhat recent version of the MySQL manual,
enums are an efficient way to store the data you described, since
each item takes exactly one of a relatively few discrete values.
Also, the length of the enummed values you chose (e.g. 'good' /
'very poor' / etc.) doesn't really affect the storage or accessing
issues.  (So you can choose long, verbose, human-readable names just
as efficiently as short terse names.)

	I couldn't really follow your description, but it sounds if
you have a lot of enum fields in a table, each with the same set
of possible values, you might also want to consider having two
separate tables -- one main table, and a table of, say, high-medium-low
responses.  The 2nd table, would of course be keyed back to a unique ID
in the first table, as well as have its own field name key (i.e. which
high-medium-low question).

	I don't think it will matter as much for performance whichever
way you go.  The first way is simpler, but a little harder to add
fields, since you may have to hard-code all the column names into your
input HTML form, your PHP script, your MySQL table, and maybe also your
reporting HTML interfaces.  With the second (two-table) approach, you can
keep the list of fields flexible -- i.e. you won't have to change your
database structure whenever you add/remove fields.

	To be even more flexible, you could forget about the enum fields
(and efficiency thereof) and just store all the responses as TEXT
columns.  This would really allow you to easily add/remove fields from
your input and reporting interfaces.  If you have plenty of disk space
and CPU power at all times, you might rather trade efficiency for
flexibility.

	I recently built a "LAMP" form handler for a guy who had an HTML
questionnaire of some sort.  My handler simply cycles through all $_POST
fields, and inserts each field as its own row in the database.  So I made
two tables as described above: each questionnaire POST inserts one (1) row
into the first table, gets the last_insert_id from that operation, and then
stores a row in the other table for *each* of the $_POST fields/values.
The second table inserts also get keyed with that last_insert_id, in order
to tie each questionnaire's data together. The tables look like this:

mysql> desc q1_id;
+--------+--------------------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field  | Type                           | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+--------+--------------------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id     | int(11)                        |      | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| status | enum('NEW','DOWNLOAD','PURGE') |      |     | NEW     |                |
| ts     | timestamp(14)                  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+--------+--------------------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> desc q1;
+-------+--------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type               | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+--------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| id    | int(11)            |      | MUL | 0       |       |
| name  | varchar(16) binary |      | MUL |         |       |
| value | text               | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+--------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)



	Then, the reporting interface works roughly like this:
1/ SELECT DISTINCT all field names from the second table -- in order to 
get a complete list of fields.  2/ SELECT second table LEFT JOIN first table
ORDER BY the common ID -- this groups all of the data for each submission
together.  3/ Loop through the results, watching for the common ID to change.
When it does, print out all the fields, in the order gotten in step 1/.
The result is a spreadsheet which changes dynamically whenever new fields
are added to the questionnaire.  I will never have to update the PHP
application or the MySQL structure.  The guy can change his own HTML fields,
and they will automatically appear in his spreadsheet report.

	I hope you find this half as interesting as I do!  Have fun re-writing!

Best,

George Webb

my 2 cents:

	I started out loving enum fields, especially for storing the results
of select inputs from web forms. The romance was short lived. As I needed
more and more mined information from my db's, as well as having to create
more categories for the above mentioned selects the UNnormalized effect  in
my database took their toll on my short sighted design ideas. Basically,  my
way of thinking now is that if something in a table column changes with
greater frequency than the rest of the information in the row then it
probably should be pulled into another table. Hey, joins are quite speedy if
slightly complex at first :) A nice side affect of this practice is the
ability to keep a record of changes rather than just a write over of old
information (kinda roll your own tranactioning).

Hi Joshua:

I'd second Hans' motion to normalize the data.  First, because it allows 
adding, editing, deleting categories throughout the database by adjusting 
the values in one field, rather than having to issue several ALTER TABLE 
queries.  Second, it allows long term portability of your schema to other 
database management systems.

Considering your setup, I'd use a char(1) field so you can quickly make
sense out of the abbreviated value when viewing the output from the main
table.

Tagging on a late reply, enums are cool but they become unwieldy with 
large sets.  They're mainly useful for protecting against range 
violations, which you can do just as easily in your application.  But 
mainly they're a poor substitute for foreign key constraints, or at 
least I think so.

I haven't played with InnoDB's FK constraints yet but the general idea 
is to create your restricted dataset in a reference table, indexed on a 
unique ID.  Then you reference that table from your main table whenever 
you add a new row with a species_id you want to have first defined:

CREATE TABLE ref_species (
	species_id INT NOT NULL,
	description VARCHAR2(100),
	PRIMARY KEY (id));

CREATE TABLE species (
	id INT NOT NULL,
	species_id NOT NULL,
	... more columns ...
	FOREIGN KEY (species_id) REFERENCES ref_species(species_id)
	ON DELETE SET NULL) TYPE=INNODB;

(or something like that).  What this does is prevent you from entering a 
species_id into 'species' that wasn't predefined in 'ref_species'.  This 
should be a last line of defense though because it will throw a db error 
if you try to do otherwise.  Your application should sanity-check that 
value before you ship it off to the database.

Larry

Let's have look about your problems 1 by 1

1: Problem of storing and accessing large volume of files in 1 container directory.

A: In such cases splitted directory structure solution is best like what "Rick Seeger" has suggested. Hence you can design a special directory structure that can generate new directory as and when total amout of files execeeds the limit say... 100 files per directory. Below sample function does that (it generate new directory as soon as "id" exceeds value 100)

// CRATES A DIRECTORY ACCORDING TO GIVEN ID AND PARENT DIR PATH
function createDir($id,$parent)
{
    $nd_dirlimit = 100;

    $mod = ceil($id/$nd_dirlimit) - 1;

    $dirs = $mod * $nd_dirlimit + 1;
    $dire = $dirs + $nd_dirlimit - 1;

    $tempDir = $dirs."_".$dire;

    if(! file_exists("$parent/$tempDir"))
          mkdir("$parent/$tempDir",0777);

    return "$tempDir";
}

By above method dirctory structure will be like ../1_100/, ../101_200/, ../201_300/ and in each directory file name with id say "1.xml" to "100.xml" (or with any name) will reside. Once above directory structure is implemented no script will crawl like now :D.

2: Importing Data into DB by parsing XML files

A: Use php's file "XPath.class.php" this is very nice OO file to parse XML documents at greater speed. It has lot of easy to use method and properties like $xml->evaluate, $xml->setAttributes, $xml->appendChild, $xml->removeAttribute, $xml->exportToFile etc...by which you can parse lot of XML documents like playing Zigsaw puzzles. It is very handy, class based php file. Check example at http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~sa386/php/XPath_V2/testBench/useCases/

Some times it is useful to use Utilities of Perl and executing your perl/cgi scripts from console level. This very fastest and reliable method IF such doucmens are to be generated, read or write in batch mode. Perl's XML::DOM package helps here. Other advantage of such mechanism is that you can run such scripts seperately from other servers that has connection with your DB server, hence reduction of overhaed on your main server that has php scripts running.

Another method is XSQL that is powerful but still new to us and PHP, where your DB SQL is written directly into XML file that syncronises (update your XML document from DB by executing XSQL) your XML and DB from 2 ways. (Can't tell much here :( )

3: Is there another way to index and query large volumes of documents?

A: I am not getting here exactly your problem, But if you need faster document access from directory or file system (serching 1 file from million files) then answer of 1 st question can help here where you just need to search particular document from 100 files from documnet diretory, already given from DB.

And if question is related to Data then use of indexes (Indexing commonly used fields in Db like primary keys and foreigh keys) in mysql can make "Access of record" faster.

Hi All...

Does anyone know of any PHP debugging tools other than PHP info? thanks.


well, depends on what you'd like to do and what box things are running
on...

given that phpinfo( ) can help in certain circumstances, you can place
echo or print statements strategically in your code as well as make use
of var_dump( ) and print_r( ).

print_r is particularly handy...

if on the other hand you're looking for a development/debugging
environment, Zend provides that in their Zend Studio product (for $) and
thereare also debuggers that run on a particular platform like gdb --
although gdb (the GNU debugger) may be more than you're looking for..

Subject: Closing ?> tag
Message-ID: <BAY2-F91wcSBsfnof7300015ce8@hotmail.com>

Greetings,

I noticed at Zeev's demo of the Zend Studio that he tended to leave off the 
end ?> tag when writing up sample code.


In the phpComponents documentation (http://pcoms.net/submit.php), Hans 
advises leaving it off:

"Layout: The first line of pCom source should only contain <?php the full 
opening PHP tag. Closing PHP tags must not be used...The full opening PHP 
tag <?php should always be used, where as closing tags should never be 
used."


On the other hand, Sterling strongly advises that it not be left off 
(http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.lang&article=403):

"I definitely think that _you_ should do it."


Is there any rationale for leaving it off?  Style? Performance?  Ensuring 
that you're keeping logic separate from presentation templates?


Thanks for any thoughts,
-Dan

I noticed that too -- and I was happy to see it since the editor I use 
(Quanta) seems to add blank lines at the end of my files sometimes, thus 
wreaking havoc with header() calls. Delete the ?> tags, problem solved. Heh.

But seriously, it does seem a little sloppy. Is there any reason to 
leave them off, other than to ensure that no unparsed output creeps into 
your code?

Not sure if I understand, but try getting rid of that empty line right after
the first hash-bang line.  Other than that, make sure the script itself is
marked as +x and that it has UNIX line endings.

Well, there's of course Zend's products, http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/,
apd.communityconnect.com, and a slew of IDE products that integrate these
(look at the Survey area of the dd.cron.ru link).

Internal to PHP, var_dump() and print_r() are nice, plus debug_backtrace()
and good ol' echo  :)

Well, two against one :)  In the posting above, the poster outlines the exact
reason for not including an ending tag, IMO.  In included files using an end
tag will only bite you in the end, and there is no reason for it; PHP will
drop out of PHP parsing mode at the end of the file anyway.  And:

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=21891

which probably could have been received a little better  :)


> Is there any rationale for leaving it off?  Style?
Yeah, style and debugging.

> Performance?

well, at least i 'get' the argument for includes...

But I am still pretty uncomfortable assuming that I only want php in an
include. Also, depending on a parsing engines behavior based on code
formatting smacks of all those horrors one can only call "Python." I guess I
am concerned here about a double standard... for example: I think we can
probably agree that curly braces should be used on all conditionals and
loops, if only for clarity(double standard?). So, when we decide that
delimiters need only  be used willy-nilly I begin to get that same sinking
feeling as when I code JScript or HTML 3.x (mostly knowing that I'll be
revisiting this code in some bizarre bug-hunt when the unexpected happens as
it always does)

aha, so this refers *only* to tags in included files where the only or last 
item is php code?

Yeah, I just left my two cents there-- the documentation for include() 
specifically states that end tags are required. Lopping them off is a 
style decision that depends on some as-yet undocumented behavior.

It seems like a "best practice" for includes that are purely PHP, but is 
it a bug or a feature?

You guys can do what you want, but I end every php file with 

return;?>

with absolutely nothing after the closing tag...

as for editors that add stuff at the ends of files...  why would you
ever want to let it do that?

I always use closing tags and use frequent header() calls, and have yet to 
be bitten.  As others have mentioned, the docs say included files need to 
be complete files, so items with opening tags need closing tags.

I hate unclear and inconsistent docs, let alone behaviors!  I hope 
that gets cleared up.

Of course there are! (that said, finding anything in them is another story :)

http://nyphp.org and click Mailing Lists, then look at the listings of

I know it has been discussed here before but doesn't seem like there is
a way to access an archive for this list.  Looking for web host that
will support Perl, PHP and MySQL basically a LAMP setup.  Price of
course is always important.

Subject: I'm stupid...
Message-ID: <BAF13FAF.BEEB%jfreeman@amnh.org>

I've made a conceptual breakthrough (duh!) with regards to this project I'm
working on to really get to a meaningful skill level with MySQL/PHP
development.  But.. for some reason, I'm really stuck on this one point:

I have a database called 'wasps'.  The database has 19 tables so far most of
which are 'lookup' tables (is that the right term?)...

The main table in the database is called 'specimens'.  Each 'specimen' has a
taxonomy (order, family, genus, subgenus, species, subspecies).

For each part of the taxonomy I have a separate table.

Ideally, when someone loads the survey form to begin building a new record
in the 'specimens' table, I want to query those taxonomy tables (order,
family, genus, etc...) so that I can build
<select><option></option></select> menus based on the rows inside each
taxonomic table...

I want to do this using 'foreach'...

I've tried a few different things but I can't get it to work:

mysql_connect($host, $user, $password)
    or die("Could not connect to database");
mysql_select_db($database)
    or die ("Could not select $database database");

print "The current database is $database";

$query= mysql_query("select * FROM order");

$result = $query;
        print ("<select name=\\"order\\">");
        foreach ($result as $key=>$val)
        print "<option value=\\"1\\>$val</option>";
        print ("</select>");
        }

?>

but this does not work.. i know I'm close.. and I just spent 2 hours at
barnes & nobles at a table in the cafe with a bunch of PHP books (couldn't
find that WROX book someone suggested earlier)  trying to make this work on
just the order table because that table only has one record in it...  but I
could not make it work.. if I can figure out how to make this, I'll be able
to make considerable progress on this thing..

Someone please help me over this hump!

Thanks!

your $query just returns a pointer to the mysql result set... it is not an
array

now use mysql_fetch_assoc($query); to get each row in tuern as an assoc
array...

I'm sorry but only I am allowed to self-abase myself, you will have to stop
at once.

Meanwhile, your $query is a mySQL reference pointer, not an array.  To
obtain an array out of the resultset pointer there are several ways in PHP
to do it, one way that pops up in my head (probably not the best way but..)
is mysql_fetch_rows:

for ($i = 0; $row = mysql_fetch_row($query); $i++) {
 echo "<option value='$row[0]'>$row[0]</option>";
}

The option looks suspicious:

You're missing a quote that I assume you're escaping, and you're assigning a 
non-unique value to the entire set of options

    print "<option value=\\"1\\>$val</option>";

try:

    foreach ($result as $key=>$val) {
        print "<option value=\\"$key\\">$val</option>";
    }

Like this?


mysql_connect($host, $user, $password)
    or die("Could not connect to database");
mysql_select_db($database)
    or die ("Could not select $database database");

print "The current database is $database";

when I try to run this in the browser I get this:


Warning: Supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in
/Users/jfreeman/Sites/wasps/test.php3 on line 22

so... i guess i'm still close.. but no cigar..

I think you want to return to $result here, since it's used below.

$result is not an array - it's a resource handle pointing to a chunk of
memory that contains MySQL's data.  You'd probably want something like:

for( $rows = array(),$i = 0,$rowcnt = mysql_num_rows($result); $i < $rowcnt;
++$i ) {
   $rows[] = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
}


foreach( $rows as $rownum => $row ) {
   foreach( $row as $colname => $colvalue ) {
      echo "<br><br>$rownum => $colname => $colvalue";
   }
}


... for example.

Josh,

Can you write your query like this:
mysql_query("select * from order")  or die ("query failed: <br>error_no: 
".mysql_errno()."<br>error: 
".mysql_error()."<br>query:$sql<BR><hr>$error_msg");

and tell us what happens?

Hi Hans, et al.

Thanks for the response and advice Hans...

I don't know if this is salient to your response but ideally, what I want
the combination of the query and the foreach to do is to go into the 'order'
table, grab the single record that's in there (it has two columns, an
'order_id' column and an 'order_name' column) and then, in my form, build:

<select name="order">
          <option value="1">Hymenoptera</option>
        </select>



so... the "1" in the 'value="1" is from the 'order_id' column and the
'Hymenoptera' is from the 'order_name' column.

I'm not sure if this was clear before..  I know it wasn't clear from my code
snippet.

Thanks..

J.

No one seems to have mentioned this, but 'order' is a reserved word in
MySQL. See http://mysql.tviund.is/doc/en/Reserved_words.html

Hi Josh,

See my other post on your mysql problem.

I would modify your query to be this:

$sql = "select order_id, order_name from order";

then, when you get the results straightened out, you can do something 
like this:

$result = mysql_query($sql);
print '<select name="order">';
while ($query = mysql_fetch_assoc($result) ) {
    print "<option 
value=\\"$query[order_id]\\">$query[order_name]</option>\
";
}
print '</select>';

Something that might be a good thing to do is to run the query above, 
and do the following:
print_r(mysql_fetch_row($result));
print_r(mysql_fetch_assoc($result));
print_r(mysql_fetch_array($result));

This can give you a lot of insight into how PHP stores the MySQL data, 
and how you might iterate through it.

Max,

give yourself a big hand...  you know.. that was creeping around in the back
of my brain at one point but I wasn't sure if that was going to break what I
was trying to do or not.. apparently you hit the nail on the head...

so.. now.. it's building this:

<select name="order"><option value="1">1</option><option
value="1">Hymenoptera</option></select>

so.. i'm close... here's the code I'm using now:


$query= mysql_query("select * FROM taxa_order");

  $result = mysql_fetch_assoc($query);
        print ("<select name=\\"order\\">");
        foreach ($result as $key=>$val)
        print "<option value=\\"1\\">$val</option>";
        print ("</select>");

so.. what do i need to adjust so I get this:

<select name="order"><option value="1">Hymenoptera</option></select>  ?

J.

Thanks for everyone who's chimed in so far... I appreciate the various code
snippets but I'm trying to see if I can do everything I need here using
'foreach()'...

so.. 

since this:

$query= mysql_query("select * FROM taxa_order");

  $result = mysql_fetch_assoc($query);
        print ("<select name=\\"order\\">");
        foreach ($result as $key=>$val)
        print "<option value=\\"$key\\">$val</option>";
        print ("</select>");

yields this:

<select name="order"><option value="order_id">1</option><option
value="order_name">Hymenoptera</option></select>

how do I get it to stop from creating two <option></option> rows (there's
only one row in the table!) and how do I get it to stop from including the
names of the columns and just including the value for each column in the one
row?

J.

The function mysql_fetch_array() uses a constant for the different types
of result arrays. The following constants are defined:

Table 3. MySQL fetch constants

constant description
MYSQL_ASSOC Columns are returned into the array having the fieldname as
the array index.
MYSQL_BOTH Columns are returned into the array having both a numerical
index and the fieldname as the array index.
MYSQL_NUM Columns are returned into the array having a numerical index
to the fields. This index starts with 0, the first field in the result.

Hi Max,

I can see you're trying to help me and I appreciate it.

So...  I can't seem to do anything with either mysql_fetch_both or
mysql_fetch_num... mysql_fetch_array brings up TOO much information...

I don't have enough background yet to put the information you've given me
here to good use.

J.

You'll need to do this:

<?php

$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM taxa_order");

$rowcnt = mysql_num_rows($result);

?>

<select name="taxa_order">
  <?php for( $i = 0; $i < $rowcnt; ++$i ): ?>
   <option
value="<?=mysql_result($result,$i,0)?>"><?=mysql_result($result,$i,1)?></option>
  <?php endfor; ?>
</select>



Oh wait, you wanted to use foreach()  --  Don't :)

Unless you want to iterate over the result using for()/while(), then you
could iterate over the resulting array with a foreach - but that's just
silly.

What you'd like to see is a "mysql_fetch_resultset_into_array()" like Oracle
has.  Then you'd have an array that you could iterate over.

I think this would make for a good pCom  :)

You probably want something like this:

$result = mysql_fetch_assoc($query);

echo '<select name="order">';
foreach ($result as $row) {

$option_value = $row['order_value'];
$option_label = $row['order_label'];

// replace order_value with the name of the column with the value in it
// replace order_label with the name of the column with the label in it

echo "<option value=\\"$option_value\\">$option_label</option>";
echo "</select>";

If you would like me to explain further how this works just ask.

well.. I didn't do it using 'foreach'.. but I did do it using some code from
chapter 17 of the wrox book that was recommended by louie...


here's the working code:

$query= mysql_query("select * FROM taxa_order");

print ("<select name=\\"order\\">");
while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($query)) {
print "<option value=\\"$row[0]\\">$row[1]</option>";

and the result:

<select name="order"><option value="1">Hymenoptera</option>

which is exactly what I was trying to do...

now.. if only i could figure out how to get the same result using
'foreach'...

your foreach is incrementing through the first array (or row) of the
result...

try

//get all result
$query= mysql_query("select * FROM taxa_order");

//get each row
while( $result = mysql_fetch_assoc($query){
	//get rid of array
 	extract($result);
	// build options
	$options = "<options>$order_name</options>";
}

print(<select>$options</select>); 

foreach is more apropos when doing thing like listing elements of an array

hope this helps

as far as i can tell,

mysql_fetch_array($result,MYSQL_ASSOC)

and

mysql_fetch_assoc($result)


do exactly the same thing

Without knowing too much about your table structure and schema I can only
guess that the data in your table is configured in such a way as:

id  name
1   NULL
2   Eumen..
3   Masar..

etc.

Check your data and retry the query parsing, else, try another looping
method

For some reason, I get the idea that you want the computer to figure
out the names of the MySQL columns, *without human knowkedge
beforehand*, and have them show up on the web site.  Is that true?

Subject: new problems (VERY LONG but hopefully interesting)
Message-ID: <BAF196CC.BF51%jfreeman@amnh.org>

If I can solve the problems described below for one place in the project I'm
working on, the solution will be applicable to many other places as well. I
also think that the information will be useful for other people learning how
to build apps using MySQL/PHP.

As I've mentioned before, the main table in my database is called
'specimens'.

With regards to the survey form here's what I can do so far:

I am able to use PHP to build <select><option></option></select> menus and
lists.

Some of these are menus where the surveyor can only select one item.  I
*can* figure out how to write INSERT statements so that these selections can
be inserted in a record in the 'specimens' table.

Others of these are menus where the surveyor can select more than one item.
I *believe* this means I'm going to have to create a table that relates the
specimen_id (the key to the 'specimens' table) with the 1 or >1 number of
items that are selected from the list by the surveyor.

I'm not sure what the structure of that relate-table should be.

For example, there's a section of the survey regarding the 'composition' of
the specimens that are being surveyed.  In my form, it's a drop-down list
from which multiple selections can be made.  The drop-down list in the form
is dynamically built by querying the 'composition' table.

here's a dump of the 'composition' table:

CREATE TABLE composition (
  comp_element_id smallint(3) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  comp_element varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (comp_element_id)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

#
# Dumping data for table `composition`
#

INSERT INTO composition VALUES (1, 'Paper/Carton');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (2, 'Glandular Secretion');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (3, 'Leaves');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (4, 'Bark Fragments');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (5, 'Paper/Carton with high Saliva Content');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (6, 'Insect Remains');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (7, 'Wood/Twigs');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (8, 'Leaves/Wood chewed into Paste');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (9, 'Clay/Mud');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (10, 'Wax');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (11, 'Rootlets');
INSERT INTO composition VALUES (12, 'Plant Resin');

Let's say that the surveyor selects id numbers 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12 from the
drop-down multiple select list.

In that case, I guess I have to create a new table that relates my main
'specimen' table with the compositional elements in the 'composition' table.

I will call this table 'composition_group'.

This table has three columns. One stores a 'comp_group_id', one stores the
'specimen_id' number of the specimen we're working on at the moment, and the
last column stores the the id numbers 1, 3, 4, 8, 10 and 12 from the
'composition' table so we know which compositional elements this specimen is
comprised of.  

I believe the 'composition_group' table will look like this:


CREATE TABLE composition_group (
  comp_group_id smallint(3) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  specimen_id smallint(3) NOT NULL,
   comp_group_values varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (comp_group_id)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

#
# Dumping data for table `composition_group`
#

INSERT INTO composition_group VALUES (1, 5, '1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12');
INSERT INTO composition_group VALUES (2, 6, '2, 3, 10');
INSERT INTO composition_group VALUES (3, 7, '4, 6, 7, 8, 11');
INSERT INTO composition_group VALUES (4, 8, '7, 8, 10');

Does this make sense?...

Meanwhile, back in the main 'specimen' table, the column for 'composition'
will contain the 'comp_group_id' that relates to the current 'specimen_id'.

Right?

***I'm worried about the fact that the comp_group_values are numeric and
need to have commas between them... will this be a problem?***


So.. that's the first problem...


I think the second problem is stickier.

For many of the areas of the survey, whether they are presented as single
select drop-down menus, multiple select drop-down menus or checkboxes, there
is also a space for the surveyor to input an 'other' such as:

<input type="text" size="10" name="composition"> Other

using this example, whatever is typed in there needs to be added to the end
of the 'composition' table and made part of the record in the
'composition_group' table for that survey...

thus, then NEXT time someone loads the form, the new compositional element
would be part of the drop down menu or list.

Where I get completely lost how to handle the 'other' problem with survey
areas that use checkboxes instead of menus/lists.  I guess this means that
I'm going to have to also learn how to build groups of checkboxes
dynamically by looking inside the database..

Well.. I could probably figure this out using the same PHP I used to
dynamically build menus/lists.

Anyway.. these are the next problems I need help solving.

Any advice greatly appreciated.

!!!

Thanks!

Just as a point of database normalization, I don't think you need to have
the specimen id and the composition group id in both tables....I would leave
the composition group id column out of the specimen table, and just have the
relation be specimen id in both the composition group table and the specimen
table.

As for the 'other' option...you would have to create two insert statements,
the first one inserting a new record into the composition options table, the
second inserting that record (including the newly created value in
composition options) into the composition group table.

First of all, thanks for reading my ridiculously long message!

I see.. so... i should remove the column for 'composition_group_id' from the
'specimen' table... but the composition_group table will look the way I
described it below...

OK.. so, all I'm left with is that the next time someone loads the form, all
the menus/lists and checkboxes are dynamically built in the <form> so that
any additions to the menus are properly displayed..

Thanks Melissa...

cheers,

Hi,
too bad i made u search for the book, i thought, the code should help along with the tutorials on O'reiley and devarticles. anyways....
 
ok, if u are game to try a small example, i would like to try to break this table into two. one that holds the "only" selected option and one that holds >1 options with the id field in common. is this how u r proceeding? may be repeating your work to u.... 
 
if u r not very particular about the column names and can go with opt1, opt2, opt3 and so on, then u only need the initial table to be 
ID   OPT1
1    abc
when the user selects more than one, u can have the table extended. there is a tutorial by Ben Rowe where he describes how to include the details provided by the user at the time of registration. 
... "The last function allows us to customize what the session table stores. The session table stores a primary key, session id, username, userid and auth level (used for creating administrators, etc). But what happens when you want to store a persons first and last names so that you can quickly retrieve them? " ...
 
i guess u r in a similar position. take a look at the first 2 parts, that should help. http://www.devarticles.com/author.php?authorId=3
 
>I'm not sure what the structure of that relate-table should be.

i guess yr 2nd problem is partly answered too. i mean either of yr queries would find a solution.

Subject: global variables
Message-ID: <E9068ECDE14FD51198D800508BAEEAD7033F2DCF@USA1370MS1>

Hi all,

I have questions regarding global.  It appears that my program that uses
global no longer work consistently.  I think because global has been turned
off in newer server.  I only need global variables so that functions can use
them, however I really do not want to pass everything by value to the
function.

So this code is out:

global $var1, $var2;

I don't know if I should use session (cost?):

declare $_SESSION['var1']... outside the function and do the reverse inside
the function

My current solution is to use $_GET:

declare $_GET['var1']... outside the function and do the reverse inside the
function, i.e., $var1 = $_GET['var1']

Can someone tell me if there's anything wrong with this last option?  I
don't want to use 2nd option because my program is an include file so I
cannot use session_start() consistently.

Thank you,

Pinyo

why not just have each site in a separate directory under DocumentRoot?

e.g. if the document root is /var/www/html, then site directories under
that path, "site1", "site2", etc

so the only thing you'd have to do is http://locahost/site1
and so forth...  or just localhost/site1

Hi Jon,

On my Windows development enviroment, I do this:
Create virtual hosts in httpd.conf
<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName dev.nyphp.org
    DocumentRoot "d:\\sites\\dev.nyphp.org"
</VirtualHost>

You can also define other server specific configurations there as well as
PHP ini values.

In the hosts file (C:\\WINNT\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts) I add the virtual
domain to resolve to my localhost:
127.0.0.1	dev.nyphp.org

The (IE) browsers needs to be closed before any changes in the hosts file
will kick in.

(This can also be done on a Linux box)

Hope this helps.

Best,

Does it need to be port based?  I don't know how to set that up, but I use
Apache for plenty of different dev sites on my computers (windows):

Be sure to uncomment this line in httpd.conf:

NameVirtualHost *

Then minimum add this per site:

 <VirtualHost *>
         DocumentRoot "c:\\foobar"
         ServerName foobar
 </VirtualHost>

Also edit your windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts file to reflect the new
sites, ie:

127.0.0.1  foobar


The above works for me.  :)

Even if you do get virtual host working I believe you sill still have 
problems due to DNS issues.  So even if virtual host is for 
www.xxxx.com is working your DNS will need to point to your laptop as 
the host of that domain.  Otherwise how else will the domain be 
resolved.  Do you need to have all sites active at once?

To specify a port to listen to multiple ports, you have to do two things
 if I am remembering correctly. The first is find the line that says
'Listen 80' and change it to 'Listen 80 81 82' etc. Then on each
<VirtualHost *> tag you can do <VirtualHost *:80> etc. Another solution
would be to follow John Lacey's suggestion but use host based vhosts.
You could add a line in your hosts file for each site, and then just use
http://site1/ and http://site2/

The hosts file should be in /etc/hosts or in your windows directory.
If you wanted to do it this way you would add lines like this:

127.0.0.1  site1
127.0.0.1  site2

You can name them whatever you like (as long as they are legitimate host
names)

Ahhhh ... forgot about the host file ... much thanks! :-)

I just mapped a bunch of single names to localhost:

127.0.0.1 site1
127.0.0.1 site2
127.0.0.1 site3

And the virtual hosting works like a charm ...

True ... with a full domain it won't work and it's just me @ the moment so
the names along the network don't really matter, it's just more convienent
to have them up @ once.

Ahh ....

Thank you.  I just realized they all won't map out to ports either way
because "localhost" can only have a single DocumentRoot.  The named hosting
works fine.

Subject: Adding <br> and <p> to a text
Message-ID: <p05210211baf28cefdc3c@[192.168.0.2]>

Hello,

I have this function (see below)  that add <p> to create paragraph to 
text that are coming either from a database (where its unformatted), 
or from a <textarea>.

Now, I wrote this a while ago, and I remember that it took me quite 
some times to come up with a function that work. Its used in a 
controlled environment, so I don't need to strip any html tags or 
javascript in  it, but I migth add a new param to the function just 
for that and use strip_tags().

Now, what I'd like to do is to add <br> after one carriage and keep 
the 'autoparagraphs' feature.

----------------------------------------------
For example I'd like to turn this:
----------------------------------------------

This is one paragraph.

And this another one.

And the first sentence of the last paragraph.
And this the last sentence of the last paragraph.


----------------------------------------------
As this:
----------------------------------------------

<p>
This is one paragraph.
</p>

<p>
And this another one.
</p>

<p>
And the first sentence of the last paragraph.<br>
And this the last sentence of the last paragraph.
</p>

----------------------------------------------

This function work well for adding paragraph, but I'm not sure how to 
tackle the question of <br>.

Maybe some of you have already a function that just do that, or can 
point to me how I could change my function to handle the <br>. I'm 
sure that almost every PHP programmer had done something similar.

TIA

ps: ajouteParagraphes == addParagraph

function formateTexte ($texte, $ajouteParagraphes=1) {

     # translation of accented char, we keep all html tags
     $table = get_html_translation_table (HTML_ENTITIES);
     $table['<'] = '<';
     $table['>'] = '>';
     $texte = strtr ($texte, $table);

     if ($ajouteParagraphes) {
       # add <p>
       $texteElements = preg_split ("/\
(\\s)+/U", $texte);
       $nouveauTexte = "";
       foreach ($texteElements as $item) {
         #be sure to strip control chars
         $item = trim ($item);
         if ( strlen ($item) != 0 ) {
           $nouveauTexte .= "<p>$item</p>\
";
         }
       }
       $texte = $nouveauTexte;
     }
     return $texte;
}

That doesn't seem entirely right-- global $var1, $var2; should still 
work just fine. What's been turned off is probably "register_globals" 
which only applies to server environment and CGI request variables, not 
variables that you declare at runtime.

file:///usr/local/share/doc/php/configuration.directives.html#ini.register-globals

If either $var1 or $var2 are really $_GET['var1'] or $_GET['var2], then 
you'll need to explicitly assign them in global scope like so:

<?php

function foo() {
    global $var1, $var2;
    return $var2.$var1;
    }

$var1= $_GET['var1'];
$var2= $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];

?>

Should work...

After you determine each paragraph, would it work to call nl2br($item) ?

Hello Listfriends; sorry this is slightly off-topic.

I recently switched web hosts, and I'm getting really frustrated. At least
once a week, my email will go down for a day. Less frequently, the web
server and the ftp server will also be unavailable.

I've searched their website for a voice phone # -- can't find any. My emails
to "support" go unanswered.

So, suggestions on what to do now? I mean it's $60 -- that's a year, paid in
advance -- so it's not so much the money as the principle of the thing...

Ah! PHP surprise me everyday with 'out of the box' solutions. Thanks 
a lot for the pointer.

I made some mods to my function and its working as expected.

   function formateTexte ($texte, $ajouteParagraphes=1) {

       $texte = trim ($texte);

       # translate accented chars to html entities
       # keep html tags
       $table = get_html_translation_table (HTML_ENTITIES);
       $table['<'] = '<';
       $table['>'] = '>';
       $texte = strtr ($texte, $table);
      
       if ($ajouteParagraphes) {
         # add <p>
         $texteElements = preg_split ("/\
(\\s)+/U", $texte);
         $nouveauTexte = "";
         foreach ($texteElements as $item) {
           #be sure to strip control chars
           $item = trim ($item);
           if ( strlen ($item) != 0 ) {
             $nouveauTexte .= "<p>$item</p>";
           }
         }
         # add <br /> and 2 newlines after </p>
         $table = null;
         $texte = nl2br($nouveauTexte);
         $table["</p>"]    = "</p>\
\
";
         $texte        = strtr ($texte, $table);
       }
       return $texte;
   }

This list rocks!

Hi Chris,

Thanks.  Oops, I figured it out as I was writing this.

Essentially, my web page call a template.php file.  The body text is already
inside a function called render_body() that's why variable that should be
global is not global (because it is in local scope of a function).  Well, in
this case, I can still force local variable into global scope by doing
something like this:

function render_body() {
	$var1 = "this is a locally defined variable";
	$_GET['var1'] = $var1;  // $var1 is local variable defined in
render_body() function
}

Then in another function call, the variable like this

function someOtherFunction() {
	$var1 = $_GET['var1']; // because using global $var1 will not work
	echo $var1;
}

Is this okay?

Thank you,
Pinyo

Should work...

Would you be able to tell us who it is so that we can avoid them?  Do they
have money back guarantee?  Not sure what you can do beside switching.

Is BBB helpful?  Or causing damage by establishing host to avoid list?

Just my 2 cents

Hello Listfriends; sorry this is slightly off-topic.

I recently switched web hosts, and I'm getting really frustrated. At least
once a week, my email will go down for a day. Less frequently, the web
server and the ftp server will also be unavailable.

I've searched their website for a voice phone # -- can't find any. My emails
to "support" go unanswered.

So, suggestions on what to do now? I mean it's $60 -- that's a year, paid in
advance -- so it's not so much the money as the principle of the thing...

Yeah, they've just blown their last chance -- worldwebhosters.com.

They're pretty damn cheap, but the old saw applies -- "You get what you pay
for."

Looks like I'm gonna have to escalate this, maybe the BBB can help with
that.

You can just declare $var1 as a global with global $var1; inside your 
first function. You don't need to pass it around using the $_GET array.

Try this:

<?php
function myfunction() {
    global $var1;
    $var1= "Hello world";
}

function mynextfunction() {
    global $var1;
    print $var1;
}

myfunction();
mynextfunction();
print " -- (^_^)P ";
?>

I've been told best practice is to NOT use globals in functions, if simply
for readability but I bet we all do :) . Also, I wonder if a passed
reference to a variable is as efficient... does anyone have an opinion on
which of these is better and why (as a general rule)
1)

	$var foo;
	function  bar(&$foo){
		do stuff to change $foo
	}

2)
	var $foo = bar();
	function bar(){
		do stuff
		return a value for $foo
	}

3)
var $foo;
bar();
function bar(){
	global $foo;
	do stuff to change $foo
}

I typically use the 2nd one if I am only changing 1 variable.  I think it is
the cleanest.  I use the first, when the function changes several variables
used by several functions.

I don't use 3rd option because it is not very clear.

I know global is not too good to use a lot, but I am trying to consolidate
variables that affect the functionality of multiple files in one place so
that the program is easier to install/customize.

Subject: OT: JavaScript IDE/editor
Message-ID: <BAY2-F44cpodlZZTLOm0001da42@hotmail.com>

Alright,

I just finished debugging a JavaScript application, and a one problem had 
plagued me for about a day and a half (later solved with a single line of 
code).

Besides document.write(), alert(), the Netscape/Mozilla JavaScript console, 
and the Venkman XPI add-on, can anyone recommend an IDE, tool, or focused 
application (like TopStyle Pro for CSS) that excels in JavaScript editing 
and debugging?

I'm not really looking for an all purpose editor such as HomeSite or 
UltraEdit, but one that sells itself purely on JavaScript editing 
capabilities and that can serve as a supplement to my regular editor (as 
TopStyle does).

Thanks for any leads.

Whoa...

 never even thought of appending the GLOBALS array!

on the same subject:
	does php get the same performace boost from referencing large arrays
instead of passing them like C?

ex:
	$fatarray = array(5 Megs o' stuff);
	sortFatArray($fatarray);

	function sortFatArray(&$fattyref){
		sort($fattyref);
	}

Ehh, well, sort of.  References in PHP are not pointers in C, although they
act similarly sometimes :)

In this case, since sort() modifies it's argument, if you wanted to sort the
global $fatarray you would need to declare the user function as accepting a
reference (with the ampersand), as well.  Otherwise, you'd end up with 10megs
of memory resident array.

On the other hand, if you are only reading the array in your user function,
it's better not to use a reference.

Hi all,

Relative newbie with my first post.  

I want to take the values of $_POST that are coming from a form and
convert them to a string.  I was attempting to scroll through the array
using while(list) and concatenate each new value to a string variable
but have been unsuccesfull so far.  I could some help with ideology
and/or code examples.

TIA,

You will probably be happier with something like:

foreach( $_POST as $key=>$value ) {
  $string .= $value . " ";
}

Also, if you disable globals (generally a good idea), $_POST won't
work anymore.  Replace with $HTTP_POST_VARS.

That's not quite right. $HTTP_POST_VARS and $_POST are the same thing. $_POST
was added in 4.1.0 to make it more convenient to use. What register_globals
does is register variables sent from the client into globals, so that you can
use $foo instead of $_POST['foo'] (or $HTTP_POST_VARS['foo'] if you use an
older version).

Unless you know what host environment you are going to be in, one may 
opt to use $HTTP_POST_VARS['foo'].  I've run into several hosts who have 
not upgraded the engine, so $_POST doesn't work.

Unfortunately, this can be an issue.  However, I also try to make the code as
"forward thinking" as possible.

$_POST = &$HTTP_POST_VARS;

at some top level include, or under a conditional that checks for a php
version, can make migrations easier.  There are still of course global scope
issues, but it's better than nothing.  But, I feel it's important to use the
newer superglobals (which aren't even that new anymore).  And of course not
register_globals!  :)

Holy smokes, I didn't realize that was possible.  Then again, I have not

Good evening,

Has anyone heard of a system for checking the compatibility and portability
of PHP source?  For instance, given a block of source, it would say minimum
PHP version requirement, various options that need to be set, extensions that
would need to be enabled, etc.

It wouldn't be terribly hard to write, but I don't want to reinvent the
wheel.  I've seen the various PHP function tables, tokenizers, etc. but a
complete solution to parse and report on a PHP source set would be handy.

Thanks,

H

I was in your position - as a fresh newbie - almost 6 months ago. Now
I'm a "seasoned" newbie. ;)

Here's the list of references that have helped me:

1. "PHP/MySQL for Dummies" - yes...kinda basic but when you're a newbie
it'll get you up and running. It  has some of the elementary stuff
explained quite nicely. I installed Apache/PHP/MySQL on my Win2000
server using the CDROM provided with the book (installation was
painless) and that helped me get a little comfortable with these
applications before I made the jump to Linux.

2. "PHP Functions: Essential Reference" from New Riders Publications.
Has a gazillion PHP functions listed by "area," i.e., string-related
functions, MySQL related functions, and so on. Many of the entries have
little code snippets, cross-references to related functions, etc.

3. For MySQL, I use "MySQL" by Paul DuBois, the second edition.

For online stuff I've found the following to be helpful:

1. http://www.phpfreaks.com/tutorial_index.php
2. http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/index.phtml/fid/51/ 
3. http://www.developer.com/lang/php/
4. Of course, http://www.php.net/ and http://www.mysql.com 
5. This mail list.

Message-ID: <1053869222.3ed0c4a6e2b4a@webmail.amnh.org>

Good morning everyone.  Thanks so much for all of your help so far.  I am 
learning a lot...  but.. I'm stuck again.

As you prolly know, I'm building a LAMP app. for some scientists who are doing 
a survey of 1000 wasps nests.

I have the form completed.  For all the parts of the form that involve drop-
down lists, I have working code that goes into a table and grabs the rows in 
the table to build the drop down list in the form.

Checkboxes and radio buttons are hard coded into the form ... I'd like to be 
able to have those be built dynamically as well, using rows from various 
tables in the database but I can't figure that one out yet...

Here's a code snippet of what I use to build the drop downs:

---------------snip--------------
<?php
    $query = mysql_query("select * FROM author");


echo "select name=\\"Array[author]\\">
    <option value=\\"\\">--select author--</option>\
;
while  ($row = mysql_fetch_row($query)) {
       print  "<option value=\\$row[0]\\">$row[1]</option>\
";
     }
print ("</select>");

--------------snip----------------

so.. this works in terms of building the drop down list.  I have no idea 
whether it will work with an insert statement so that, once I've built the 
entire POST array from the form, whatever value the surveyor chooses from the 
drop down list will be inserted in the right place in the database.


I'm COMPLETELY lost with regards to how to use the name=Array[blah-blah] 
construct when it comes to checkboxes and radio buttons...

what do I do with the 'value="somevalue"' part of the checkbox or radio 
button?  where does that go with regards to the Array[blah-blah] part?

Another point of confusion... one of the fields in the survey form 
is 'survey_date'.

I have field of type 'date' in my 'specimen' table... I'd like to have 
the 'survey_date' be handled automagically for the surveyor by PHP and MySQL.. 
any suggestions on how best to accomplish that?

There's more help that I need but this is a relatively digestible chunk..

Thanks folks!

J.

Subject: Query to Array and Array loop performance hit.
Message-ID: <000d01c322c6$ad964000$e1951d18@enobrev>

Good Morning and Happy Sunday New Yorkers (and good day to everyone
else)...
 
I'm currently working on a project with a designer, and I'm trying to do
my very best to keep my code as clean and out of his way as possible.
So basically I'm putting all my queries and all the good creamy filling
up on top, and then keeping all php code to a minimum on the bottom,
when he can rock the design.  I try to to this as much as possible as
is, but I always worry about performance (primary wrory based on this
question).
 
Clean code, check.  Queries and logic up top, check.  Output
formatting... gets a bit sticky.  The primary issue I have is
formatting.  For instance, to keep the code clean down below, I format
columns for the designer.  For instance, I format all date fields for
him, concat all vars for him (I know I can use mysql concat, but that
doesn't solve all var issues), and whatever other logic might be
necessary.  Since this is part of a outputted query loop, I can't quite
put all that logic up top.
 
So, to me, the obvious answer would be to loop through the returned
array (from the query) up top, format all the columns into a separate
array and then in the actaul doc, run a nice and neat foreach to loop
through the formatted array.  So my questions are:
 
How badly would that hurt page response time?
 
Is that just too much work for each page load?
 
Is there another viable solution (outside of templates - i've used them
and I tend to avoid them)?
 
Thanks, and have a great Sunday!!!

Build a recordset selecting all the options (SELECT * FROM options), and
loop through the results, having php spit out the appropriate tags where
necessary:


  <?php do {

    echo "<label><input type=\\"radio\\" name=\\"selections\\" ";
	echo "value=\\" " . $row_RSOptions['id'] . "\\">" .
$row_RSOptions['option_value'] . "</label><br>";
    } while ($row_RSOptions = mysql_fetch_assoc($RSOptions)); ?>

Same thing for checkboxes - just replace the input type radio with the input
type checkbox.

Subject: CM Tool / Interface to PHP
Message-ID: <HPEDLHFCBCJOAJDODGKMOECFCBAA.rudy@taytek.com>

First a little background.  While I develop LAMP applications my paying job
is as a software process engineer.  I?m from the dark-side as some
developers like to refer to my role.  One of the major elements of a
well-defined development organization is a Process Asset Library (PAL).  A
PAL is a controlled repository of artifacts typically used in the software
development process.  While I won?t bore you with all the attributes
associated with each of the artifacts what is important is the fact that
these artifacts are controlled via a configuration managed (CM) tool.  The
artifacts range in type from Word documents to Excel spreadsheets to
Powerpoint presentations.   In today?s world we use CM tools like Visual
Source Safe or Clearcase from Rational.  While these tools do an adequate
job they don?t fit into the vision I have for a PAL.

What I want is a thin-client interface (browser based) that will allow the
user to get the latest copy of a document for use or Check it out, in the CM
sense, to update and Check it back in.  The Check-out and Check-in actions
need to be controlled as they typically are via a CM tool.  The artifact
attributes will be stored in a database (MySQL) while the documents will be
controlled in the CM tool.  The thin-client will allow the users to find the
artifacts via search criteria they will select via dropdown list boxes show
the various artifact attributes.

What I?m looking for is any information on interfacing to a CM tool, CM
tools,  or better yet a CM tool that readily connects to a browser via PHP.

While I develop everything on Linux/Apache for the  web-server, I could be
convinced to use IIS (the pain) if that is necessary.  Actually some clients
may need an IIS solution so that is not totally out of the picture.

Even giving me hint of where to start looking would be appreciated.



Thanks,

Rudy

Good evening,

Has anyone heard of a system for checking the compatibility and portability
of PHP source? For instance, given a block of source, it would say minimum
PHP version requirement, various options that need to be set, extensions that
would need to be enabled, etc.

It wouldn't be terribly hard to write, but I don't want to reinvent the
wheel. I've seen the various PHP function tables, tokenizers, etc. but a
complete solution to parse and report on a PHP source set would be handy.

Thanks,

If I understand correctly, the answer is no.  You can never trust that a row
will be inserted into a database where you expect.  If you need things to be
returned in a consistently ordered manner, you'll need ORDER BY  (ie, ORDER
BY authorname per above).  If alphabetical sorting isn't what you need, you
have to maintain another column (preferably numeric) that you can sort
against.

<input type=checkbox name="thischeckbox[]" value="The First Value">
<input type=checkbox name="thischeckbox[]" value="The Second Value">

will be accessible in PHP as $_POST['thischeckbox'][0] and
$_POST['thischeckbox'][1], for instance.  Or you can set the array's element
name yourself:

<input type=checkbox name="thischeckbox[one]" value="The First V">
<input type=checkbox name="thischeckbox[two]" value="The Second V">

will end up akin to $_POST['thischeckbox']['one'] and so on in PHP.

I just wrote a pCom for this: http://pcoms.net/datetime

I use at some of my sites very successfully, however that particular pCom
isn't complete yet (and I'm working on the site as we speak), so it may not
help much.

This, to me atleast, is a common practice.  I like to do as much string
manipulation in MySQL as possible, but unless you have tons of data being
loaded, or very heavy traffic, you should have no problem eitherway. 
However, if either of these is an issue, you may want to look at some type of
cacheing.

Templates wouldn't help here - the data still needs to get fetched and
managed.  Just write clean code, paying attention to performance tweaks where
possible.

There seems like the issues at hand are twofold: one, being a
content-management-system (or document managment) and two being source
management.

For the first issue, perhaps this would help:
http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/Cracking/

Also, a google for any of the terms, PHP, document management, project
management, etc. will return results.  A similar browse and search at
http://sf.net would be useful as well, and, at a minimum, there's always the
nuke family of products (http://postnuke.org and http://phpnuke.org).  I
would recommend, however, that you search a bit more, and find something
that's more in line.

> What I?m looking for is any information on interfacing to a CM tool, CM

The defacto source code control system is CVS, http://cvshome.org.  There are
both graphical and client-side GUI interfaces available for it, most of which
are outlined at the aforementioned site or quickly retreivable via a google
search (http://cvs.php.net uses such a tool, which would be customizable, I
believe).

Most everything in the PHP world will be written for Apache first, with other
server platforms support as an afterthought.  A word of caution for IIS,
however: it's a multithreaded environment, and while modern PHP versions
support it, many extensions and the libraries they implement do not.  If you
want rocksolid, go Apache 1.3.27 and mod_php - bulletproof.

I think you might be speaking of http://gallery.sf.net.  It's functionality
is handy, but it depends on running in the environment that it checks, and
then reporting what it finds.  I'll need something that can report on
compatibility, etc. simply by looking at the source (lexical analysis).  So
far, nothing has jumped out at me, so the quest continues.

Thanks,

You sound like you are committed to checkins and checkouts. But you could
also look at it in the workflow.

For example, you create a content initially private. Once you submit to
published. Then, you can checkout and checkin. In turn, they can be viewed
as locked or unlocked(or available). You can also retract it.

You notice there is a state machine based states and transitions. For
example, you start with a state of "private". moving onto "submitted" with
transition of "submit", onto "published" or "into repository" via
"publish"...

I think you could benefit from workflow.

There are a number of efforts out there;

http://www.openflow.it/EN/index_html
http://www.zope.org/Members/hathawsh/DCWorkflow_docs

The problem you are trying to tackle seems to require a framework. If you
are just interested in checkin and checkout, there is CVS modules for
Zope/Python.

Hi Chalu,

Actually I am a strong support of workflow and have created and published a
graphical model for capturing the development process workflow (process
cartography).  I'm not committed to checkins and checkouts but simply used
that as a point of reference.  I agree with your analysis and use of a state
machine to control the flow.  There is a great workflow tool called
Teamshare that already supports an interface to several CM tools.  It does
lack the database attributing of the artifacts with the ability to perform
queries.  But your point is well made and I will follow-up on the site you
suggested.

Thanks,
Rudy

You sound like you are committed to checkins and checkouts. But you could
also look at it in the workflow.

For example, you create a content initially private. Once you submit to
published. Then, you can checkout and checkin. In turn, they can be viewed
as locked or unlocked(or available). You can also retract it.

You notice there is a state machine based states and transitions. For
example, you start with a state of "private". moving onto "submitted" with
transition of "submit", onto "published" or "into repository" via
"publish"...

I think you could benefit from workflow.

There are a number of efforts out there;

The problem you are trying to tackle seems to require a framework. If you
are just interested in checkin and checkout, there is CVS modules for
Zope/Python.

This, to me atleast, is a common practice.  I like to do as much string
manipulation in MySQL as possible, but unless you have tons of data
being loaded, or very heavy traffic, you should have no problem
eitherway. 
However, if either of these is an issue, you may want to look at some
type of cacheing.

Templates wouldn't help here - the data still needs to get fetched and
managed.  Just write clean code, paying attention to performance tweaks
where possible.

You might find the Aegis project at Source Forge interesting.
Here is a link 'http://aegis.sourceforge.net'.

It is primarily document (or source code) control -- but has a project
management-like feature, which the author refers to as change states.
e.g 'passed unit testing' 'integrated system test under review' and so on
There are a bevy of reports and it supports 'variant' (or branch) lines of 
Development.

Hope this helps --
T. Gales

For date, In your php script that handles the form, you can do 
something like:

$date = date("Y-m-d");

Then you can insert $date along with your other form variables into the 
mysql table.

Good evening,

Has anyone heard of a system for checking the compatibility and portability
of PHP source?  For instance, given a block of source, it would say minimum
PHP version requirement, various options that need to be set, extensions
that
would need to be enabled, etc.

It wouldn't be terribly hard to write, but I don't want to reinvent the
wheel.  I've seen the various PHP function tables, tokenizers, etc. but a
complete solution to parse and report on a PHP source set would be handy.

Thanks,

Hi Aaron,

So... if, in my form, I want both the date to both be part of my form input
as well as displayed on the page when the page is loaded, how do I write
that code?


Say I have a webpage 'waspsurvey.php3' that contains my form.

When a surveyor loads that page in his/her browser, the form is displayed
for the surveyor to fill out.

At a point on the form, there is the parameter 'Date:'  so, I'd want
' $date = date("Y-m-d");
  print "$date";'
in waspsurvey.php3 so that the date will print in the page.. but.. what do I
do to capture "$date" so that it becomes part of my form input?  <input
type="hidden" name="date" value="$date"> ?

J.

Hey Josh,

It would depend on how you have your form page and php processing set 
up.  How do you have your logic set up?  Do you have the form as one 
page and the php processing as a separate file, or are they both in the 
same file?

One way of making it easier is to not have any mention of date in the 
form.  You are working behind the scenes with php to input the current 
date into mysql, so you don't have to ask the user anything pertaining 
to date.  This is nice because it is one less thing you are asking the 
user to do.

In your php processing, set $date = date("Y-m-d");  Then you can use 
$date along with your other form values that are posted and insert them 
into the database.

HTH,

Aaron

there is an even easier way...

if you want the current time in your mysql database just use the mysql
function NOW() in your insert statement (this works for date, datetime
types) that way you can let the db do the messy date work. I only mess
around with dates outside a db when absolutely necessary ( and this is rare
since mysql has things like date arithmetic)

ex. insert into mytable (datefield, name) values(NOW(), "$username")

Message-ID: <3ED3945A.000003.00760@MAIN>

I was wondering if I have following two pieces of codes. Which one is better
and why.
 
1:
 
$result = mysql_query("SELECT col_name FROM table_name");
$count = mysql_num_rows($result);
 
 
2: 
 
$result = mysql_query("SELECT count(*) FROM table_name");
list($count) = mysql_fetch_row($result);
 
I always though COUNT(*) was better than getting the rows and counting them
via PHP. I need to explain it to someone as to why or why not count(*) is
better than the other method.
 
Any comments?

I would say count() does not pull the data back with it, which makes it
significantly faster when returning a large result set.

Gary,

 From mysql site it looks like now() creates date and timestamp?  If you 
are inserting to a date field, will it insert date and time, or just 
date?

mysql will judge based on field type so it works both ways :)

so in a date it inserts yyyy-mm-dd

in datetime it inserts yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss

1. don't use count(*) because mysql will pull all fields for every record...
	use $result = mysql_query("SELECT count(col_name) FROM table_name");

2. db's are optimized for this query so their return is like greased
lightening :)

3. let the db do the work!

4. You want to send as little information between the database and PHP
   as possible because it's faster. Having mySQL do the count means
   you're sending a number instead of a whole bunch of text. (This
   isn't such a big deal here, since the amount of text is small.)

That's not the case.  count(*) is preferable.  The manual says:

"COUNT(*) is somewhat different in that it returns a count of the number
of rows retrieved, whether they contain NULL values. COUNT(*) is optimised
to return very quickly if the SELECT retrieves from one table, no other
columns are retrieved, and there is no WHERE clause. For example:

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student;

( from http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Group_by_functions.html )
( see also http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Counting_rows.html )

Now, which is better in your case depends on what you're doing.  If you
JUST want to find out the rows, the latter is better.  If you're getting a
bunch of data which you then intend to output, doing one query and then
using mysql_num_rows() on it is probably more efficient.

>>>and there is no WHERE clause

Is this specific to MySQL, because I've used WHERE clauses with COUNT() in
T-SQL... you should be able to specify a WHERE clause using MySQL also. I
believe COUNT() is the same as selecting any other fields. The only
difference is that it doesn't return actual data, only an integer, which
makes it significantly faster if you're working with large result sets.

Hi All,
Normally when fopen("a.txt","r") can't open a file, either the
file doesn't exist, or can't read, it should return "FALSE", but
my "fopen" kill my script and no error message printed out.
Could someone help to tell if it is PHP configuration problem,
or a PHP bug? How to log this error message? 

Thanks in advance!

LY

You can see an example of using an error message with fopen, and logging it here:

Thanks for the hint! I just copied the following code from 
php.net and used it,

I got this "[function.fopen]: failed to create stream: HTTP
request failed! HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"

is this a configuration problem?

here is the code I copied from php.net:

// redefine the user error constants - PHP 4 only
define ("FATAL",E_USER_ERROR);
define ("ERROR",E_USER_WARNING);
define ("WARNING",E_USER_NOTICE);

// set the error reporting level for this script
error_reporting (FATAL | ERROR | WARNING);

// error handler function
function myErrorHandler ($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
  switch ($errno) {
  case FATAL:
    echo "<b>FATAL</b> [$errno] $errstr<br>\
";
    echo "  Fatal error in line ".$errline." of file ".$errfile;
    echo ", PHP ".PHP_VERSION." (".PHP_OS.")<br>\
";
    echo "Aborting...<br>\
";
    exit(1);
    break;
  case ERROR:
    echo "<b>ERROR</b> [$errno] $errstr<br>\
";
    break;
  case WARNING:
    echo "<b>WARNING</b> [$errno] $errstr<br>\
";
    break;
    default:
    echo "Unkown error type: [$errno] $errstr<br>\
";
    break;
  }
}

// function to test the error handling
function scale_by_log ($fp) {
  if ( $fp < 0 )
    trigger_error("log(x) for x <= 0 is undefined, you used: fp
= $fp",
      FATAL);
    return 0;
}

// set to the user defined error handler
$old_error_handler = set_error_handler("myErrorHandler");

Looks like the file you wanted fopen to use wasn't found (404 error). Make sure you have the correct path set, and to verify that your script is working you may want to use a test file in the simplest places possible.

Folks:
This is probably easy, but it doesn't seem to work the way it does in
Java or C++.

I want to create five objects within a loop, and add them to an array.

Everything I try seems to place one object in the last (occasionally
the first) element of the array, but I never get the whole array
filled.  sizeof( $myArray ) continually returns 1.

However, I know the objects are getting created, because I have placed
a call to the "print yourself" function inside the constructor, so I
know five objects are getting created.

What am I doing wrong?

I'll give you the highlights, and spare you most of the MySQL stuff.

Here's the class def:

  class Meeting {

  var $day;
  var $start;
  var $end;
  var $dept;
  var $course;
  var $building;
  var $room;

  function Meeting( $day, $start, $end,
		    $dept, $course, $section,
		    $building, $room ) {
    $this->day = $day;
    $this->start = $start;
    $this->end = $end;
    $this->dept = $dept;
    $this->course = $course;
    $this->building = $building;
    $this->room = $room;
    print "<p>" . $this->toString( ) . "</p>\
";
  }

  function toString( ) {
    return date( "g:i a", strtotime( $this->start ) ) . " to "
      . date( "g:i a", strtotime( $this->end ) ) . ": $this->dept "
      . "$this->course $this->section in $this->building $this->room";
  }
} // class Meeting

And here's the relevant code:

$meetings = array( );

// some more stuff

  foreach( $day_names as $day=>$name ) {

    $day_query = "select * from meetings where id = \\"{$sec_row[ "$day" ]}\\"";
    $day_result = @mysql_query( $day_query );

    $day_row = @mysql_fetch_assoc( $day_result );
    if( !is_null( $day_row[ 'start' ] ) ) {

      $meetings[ $meeting_count ] =
        new Meeting( $name, $day_row[ 'start' ], $day_row[ 'end' ],
                       $course_row[ 'dept' ], $course_row[ 'course' ],
                       $sec_row[ 'section' ], $day_row[ 'building' ],
                       $day_row[ 'room' ] );
      $meeting_count++;
    }
  }
}

Here's what I get on the page.  First, the results of the constructor
being called five times:

8:00 am to 10:50 am: CMP 103 in B 113

8:00 am to 10:50 am: CMP 103 in B 119

8:00 am to 10:50 am: CMP 103 in B 113

8:00 am to 10:50 am: CMP 103 in B 119

8:00 am to 10:50 am: CMP 218 in B 113

And then the result of print_r( $meetings ):

Array ( [4] => meeting Object ( [day] => Friday [start] => 08:00:00
[end] => 10:50:00 [dept] => CMP [course] => 218 [building] => B [room]
=> 113 ) ) 

And I'm at a loss.

We're sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.  Please
rotate your phone ninety degrees and try again.  Thank you.

Scratching head... have you tried $meetings[] = new Meeting ( etc.); ??
Not that it should matter, of course.

Also, are you PHP 4.3.1? (And not 4.3.2RC4?)

  if( !is_null( $day_row[ 'start' ] ) ) seems to be the most likely
candidate for the problem...

where do you call toString()?

Oddly, that changes the "[4]" below:

I'm actually (gasp!) at 4.1.1.  I was planning to update the box (OS,
PHP, etc.) before summer session started, but alas, I was too lazy.  I
wonder if the old version of PHP makes a difference.

No, all that does is eliminate creating empty objects for Saturday and
Sunday.  (I know, it's a hack.)

You've probably figured out as much, but *something* is reseting 
$meetings on every foreach loop.
V. strange. It's as if $mettings = array ( ); was actually inside the 
foreach.

Oh, crap, that was it.  I had that line within a while that enclosed

Hi David,

The quote from manual states that  COUNT(*) is more optimized IF there is no
column name and no WHERE clause. :)

>>>and there is no WHERE clause
 
Is this specific to MySQL, because I've used WHERE clauses with COUNT() in
T-SQL... you should be able to specify a WHERE clause using MySQL also. I
believe COUNT() is the same as selecting any other fields. The only
difference is that it doesn't return actual data, only an integer, which
makes it significantly faster if you're working with large result sets.

That's not the case. count(*) is preferable. The manual says:
 
"COUNT(*) is somewhat different in that it returns a count of the number
of rows retrieved, whether they contain NULL values. COUNT(*) is optimised
to return very quickly if the SELECT retrieves from one table, no other
columns are retrieved, and there is no WHERE clause. For example:
 
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student;
 
( from http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Group_by_functions.html )

Now, which is better in your case depends on what you're doing. If you
JUST want to find out the rows, the latter is better. If you're getting a
bunch of data which you then intend to output, doing one query and then
using mysql_num_rows() on it is probably more efficient.

4. You want to send as little information between the database and PHP
as possible because it's faster. Having mySQL do the count means
you're sending a number instead of a whole bunch of text. (This
isn't such a big deal here, since the amount of text is small.)

Putting multiple objects into an array?  Even without looking at your
code, you're on the wrong track.  Very inefficient.     

Now, let's look at your code...

First, are you calling multiple mysql_fetch_assoc's?  Sure looks like it, 
since you're calling new meeting() with $day_row[], $course_row[] etc.

I'm guessing you're getting things via multiple queries to multiple tables 
rather than writing one far more efficient query using LEFT JOIN's.

Second, why are you creating some class and method just to store some data 
that's already available in what should be one array?

I'm taking a very cursory and slightly drunken look at your code and all
it seems you're doing is a WHOLE LOT of work to save some course data.  
What is your ultimate goal here?  To print out a list of courses in a
preformatted way?  If this is the case, you could save a heck of a lot of
effort by just doing

while ($Row = mysql_fetch_array($RecordSet, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {
    echo "{$Row['start']} to {$Row['end']}: {$Row['dept']} etc...\
"
}

after executing a well formed query which does the date formatting in the 
query and joins all the relevant data up front.  Read the MySQL manual on 
how to write queries with the DATE_FORMAT() function:
    http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Date_and_time_functions.html

For JOIN syntax, see http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/JOIN.html

?> 

User Comments:
You aren`t REALLY ensuring compatability of an entire script, just the $_SERVER (etc) arrays. 

There is still one LARGE difference however. $_SERVER, $_POST, etc are all superglobal arrays, which means you don`t have to do things like: 

function foo() 
{ 
global $_SERVER; 
} 

In your example, the user would still have to have a global ... statement in any user functions they declared. 

Your example solves a LOT of problems, but not all :)

Message-ID: <003001c32534$d72243e0$4501a8c0@reconstrukt.com>

Hello all -

I rescued 66 anodized black PCs from a client's company, they were
deemed too slow for M$ applications and bloatware M$ OS.  The company is
a trading firm based out of NYC that develops trading portals for the
NYSE, these were once a part of their server farm.

The systems have a very small footprint, and are only slightly larger
than a shoebox.  They're roughly all the same inside, with specs
similiar to below:

Pentium I 90-233MHz or AMD compatible
16-128MB RAM
2GIG Hard Disk
Floppy
2 Serial
1 LPT
AT Style Motherboard

The black steel case is very solid and one-of-a-kind made specifically
for the company.  Everyone seems to like the look of this
all-anodized-steel "black box" - it's very sleek indeed.

In any case, I couldn't see throwing away 66 perfectly good computers...
Unfortunately, it seems recycling is mandatory for everything *but*
computers (go figure...)
 
If you would be interested in getting one, send me an email, off-list,
to matt at reconstrukt.com.

Thanks!

Matt

    $_ENV = $HTTP_ENV_VARS; 
} // End PHP4 < 4.1 Compatibility 
?> 

User Comments:
You aren`t REALLY ensuring compatability of an entire script, just the
$_SERVER (etc) arrays. 

There is still one LARGE difference however. $_SERVER, $_POST, etc are
all superglobal arrays, which means you don`t have to do things like: 

function foo() 
{ 
global $_SERVER; 
} 

In your example, the user would still have to have a global ...
statement in any user functions they declared. 

Your example solves a LOT of problems, but not all :)

Hi Matthew:

If you can't find individuals for all of them, contact Sustainable South
Bronx.  They're a nonprofit that, in part, processes (and resells if
possible) used items.

Hey Dan -

Unfortunately, we're not giving them away...

But we threw together a page with pricing, shipping details here: 

http://www.reconstrukt.com/blackbox/

Also note that we're including the NIC cards, unlimited memory, etc...

We'd also be willing to let you pick them up if you're local, no
problem.  


Matt

I agree.  This isn't a place to sell stuff.  If it had been a giveaway 
of old stuff that was going to be trashed, as someone else had posted 
about six months ago, that makes sense to me.  I was at the end of an 
email expressing my desire for two of them when I saw the post showing 
that there was a pricing sheet available on the web.  PLEASE, spare me!

Let's see, Pentium I, 128MB, 2GB, for $250...  I'm curious to see
how they do, given what can be had for $400 from Dell these days...

I can't speak for everyone, and I'm certainly not beating up on Matthew (the
fellow who posted about the PCs), but the gist that I got from that post was
that the machines were free (as they were "saved"), and I was actually in
the process in researching how we could use those for LIPHP (meeting
tonight, BTW, www.liphp.org - shameless plug!).  FWIW, I feel $250 can go
alot further than that in the PC space.

Let's not rule out XBox Linux:  ~$199 for 733 Celeron with DVD and a 
much smaller footprint.
Of course, you might get fired if you tried to build a Fortune 500 
server farm with them.

The site isn't in that state by choice - we are actually forming a group to
help develop it now.  But you are right, Malcolm, the new design will
definitely have the "important stuff" prominently displayed on the home
page.

As always, anyone (newbie or experienced) on LI (or in the area for the
meetings, anyway) is welcome to the meetings or to help develop the site.

http://www.liphp.org for more info.

Hello everyone,

I never meant to be misleading, so I sincerely apologize if anyone had
thought they were being given away.

Considering the large number of "hobbyists" on this list, I thought this
was a good opportunity for someone to get a slick LAMP server
up-and-running for cheap.  
 
(All things considered, with the case, the motherboard/memory/NICs we're
throwing in, it's a pretty good deal.)

And, when running Linux, they're *superfast*.  ...I thought you all were
true believers?  You should know how to tune Linux to *scream* on a PI.

And if you don't, I'm available for tutoring @ $150 / hour.

HA!  Kidding, people, kidding.

Matt

I can't speak for everyone, and I'm certainly not beating up on Matthew
(the
fellow who posted about the PCs), but the gist that I got from that post
was
that the machines were free (as they were "saved"), and I was actually
in
the process in researching how we could use those for LIPHP (meeting
tonight, BTW, www.liphp.org - shameless plug!).  FWIW, I feel $250 can
go
alot further than that in the PC space.

I agree.  This isn't a place to sell stuff.  If it had been a giveaway
of old stuff that was going to be trashed, as someone else had posted
about six months ago, that makes sense to me.  I was at the end of an
email expressing my desire for two of them when I saw the post showing
that there was a pricing sheet available on the web.  PLEASE, spare me!

I hate to thread-crap, but this last email really capped it for me :)

If someone on this list knows enough to run Linux and tune it, they also
know that they can buy something like this:

http://www.caseoutlet.com/NWPc/checkercube/checker.html

...and put in a $50 closeout drive, along with $20 stick of closeout RAM,
and end up with something faster, with more storage, and a longer shelf
life. And it also looks pretty good. And silent.

The bottom line is that your boxes are not worth $250. They are worth a
lot less, if anything at all.

As previously suggested: go to eBay and sell them to the
non-able-to-tune-linux suckers there. Enough of this. Thanks.

I think this is all just a big miscommunication.  I believe Mr. Knight has a
good intention and is genuinely trying to offer all of us a good deal for
boxes that can be very useful as Linux server.  

Now that we establishes that the price of $250 is not a good deal, perhaps
Mr. Knight can reevaluate the price and offer us the good deal he has
originally intended.  Perhaps someone more familiar with the market price
can tell us what a good price would be.

I am sure some of us here can use a good test system.  Personally, I do not
mind if members try to share the wealth and offer good deals to other
members.  Of couse we are only talking about items related to LAMP.

Cheers!

:-)

I hate to thread-crap, but this last email really capped it for me :)

If someone on this list knows enough to run Linux and tune it, they also
know that they can buy something like this:

http://www.caseoutlet.com/NWPc/checkercube/checker.html

.and put in a $50 closeout drive, along with $20 stick of closeout RAM,
and end up with something faster, with more storage, and a longer shelf
life. And it also looks pretty good. And silent.

The bottom line is that your boxes are not worth $250. They are worth a

As previously suggested: go to eBay and sell them to the
non-able-to-tune-linux suckers there. Enough of this. Thanks.

Sorry for the grumpiness, but this really pushed a button.

No. I believe direct marketing is not the function of this support list.
I also believe that deportment is also anticipated in this type of
public venue. Members who want/need direct marketing solicitations have
unlimited alternative venues.

Message-ID: <sed4dd98.046@mail.sussex.edu>

I was reamed out someone who said that you should not sell or even try to promote (they were in error as I was only responding to a question) on this list.

I agree fully with that idea and think that this should be enforced and this thread ended. I get plenty of offers to buy something useless via spam.

I think this is all just a big miscommunication.  I believe Mr. Knight has a
good intention and is genuinely trying to offer all of us a good deal for
boxes that can be very useful as Linux server.  

Now that we establishes that the price of $250 is not a good deal, perhaps
Mr. Knight can reevaluate the price and offer us the good deal he has
originally intended.  Perhaps someone more familiar with the market price
can tell us what a good price would be.

I am sure some of us here can use a good test system.  Personally, I do not
mind if members try to share the wealth and offer good deals to other
members.  Of couse we are only talking about items related to LAMP.

Cheers!

:-)

I hate to thread-crap, but this last email really capped it for me :)

If someone on this list knows enough to run Linux and tune it, they also
know that they can buy something like this:

http://www.caseoutlet.com/NWPc/checkercube/checker.html 

and put in a $50 closeout drive, along with $20 stick of closeout RAM,
and end up with something faster, with more storage, and a longer shelf
life. And it also looks pretty good. And silent.

The bottom line is that your boxes are not worth $250. They are worth a
lot less, if anything at all.

As previously suggested: go to eBay and sell them to the
non-able-to-tune-linux suckers there. Enough of this. Thanks.

Sorry for the grumpiness, but this really pushed a button.

From: chris at psydeshow.org (Chris Snyder)
Date: Wed, 28 May 2003 16:13:38 -0400
Subject: ImageMagick Info (attn: Matt Zimmerman)
Message-ID: <3ED51872.3000609@psydeshow.org>

The topic of ImageMagick came up at last night's meeting, as a way for 
PHP to work with images.
http://www.imagemagick.org/

I recommend it highly, as it is meant to be scriptable via the command 
line (and therefore via PHP shell_exec()). It's really a suite of 
commands-- the ones you're probably most interested in are convert and 
identify.

For instance, when someone uploads an image to fotola.com, here's the 
call that resizes and/or rotates it, strips any IPTC or APP16 headers, 
and compresses it at medium compression:

$command= "/usr/local/bin/convert jpeg:$tempfile -rotate $rotate 
-geometry \\"500x500>\\" -quality 95 +profile \\"*\\" jpeg:$filename"
exec($command);

 - $rotate is some number of degrees
 - the > after 500x500 means resize only if the image doesn't fit in the 
500x500 box
 - resizing is automatically proportional
 - the +profile "*" option strips all extra info from the image (making 
it 2-3KB smaller)
 - Be sure to properly escape all user input to exec() calls!!!

There is a PHP extension (coauthored by Michael Montero of Community 
Connect, no less)  that makes ImageMagick accessible to PHP without the 
exec calls, but I haven't used it yet-- might be much easier.

Thanks, Pinyo

And yes, we have accepted every offer we've received thus far, it does
clearly state that on the page), and yes, maybe $250 was a bit steep.  

Whatever, no big deal.

Oh - and jonathan, your notes on how to build a slick cube server were
well received here.  Thanks for your colorful creativity.  (By the way,
my initial comments on screaming LAMP servers on a PI was a joke. :) )

And - pswebcode guy ("Be silent and step away") - chill, man.  Put away
your light saber, this isn't a duel.  You're taking this a little too
personally. 

In fact, I've emailed a few off of this list, making non-profit contacts
that will happily take them in after we attempt to sell a few.  Donation
is definitely in store for most of these boxes, we do a *lot* of
pro-bono work over here @ Reconstrukt.

In fact, this whole thing is ridiculous!  The intention wasn't to take
up more than a single email's worth of list space - this is why I told
people to email me "off list".  ...I think the moaning and groaning from
the dissenting list members took up more space than our so-called (in
pswebcode's words) "direct marketing" did.

Peace be with everyone! :D

As others have mentioned, doing the COUNT in the DB (MySQL or any other) is
*much* faster, for the number of reasons mentioned.

COUNT uses internal database structures to do the calculations, making it the
fastest possible method.  Using WHERE or GROUP BY obviously would entail a
bit more work because it needs to be selective on the count, and can't simply
look at only internal table structures, but will remain the fastest method
for making a count in any DB.

Subject: PHP 4.3.2 released
Message-ID: <OKEHLLMAFAOHECBMOGEPAEKFEJAA.nyphp@websapp.com>

After a lengthy QA process, PHP 4.3.2 is finally out!
This maintenance release solves a lot of bugs found in earlier PHP versions
and is a *strongly* recommended upgrade for all users of PHP.

PHP 4.3.2 contains, among others, following important fixes, additions and
improvements:

- Fixes several potentially hazardous integer and buffer overflows.
- Fixes for several 64-bit problems.
- New Apache 2.0 SAPI module (sapi/apache2handler, enabled
with --with-apxs2).
- New session_regenerate_id() function. (Important feature against malicious
session planting).
- Improvements to dba extension.
- Improvements to thttpd SAPI module.
- Dropped support for GDLIB version 1.x.x (php_gd.dll) on Windows.
- An unix man page for CLI version of PHP.
- New "disable_classes" php.ini option to allow administrators to disable
certain classes for security reasons.
- ..and a HUGE amount of other bug fixes!

For a full list of changes in PHP 4.3.2, see the NEWS file.

Thanks Hans. I had misread the original post and thought it was declaring
that you couldn't use a WHERE clause with COUNT(). So without specifying a
WHERE clause, I'm assuming it takes predefined values from sys tables on the
disc? Or do these values sit in memory? Reason I'm asking is because MS
Access has no (apparent) sys tables, so I'm wondering if COUNT() works the
same way with Jet.

I can't find anything on the new session_regenerate_id() finction yet.  However if it does what I think it does, here is what I've been using in it's place:

// at this point the session is already open
$tmp_SESSION = $_SESSION;
session_unset();
session_destroy();

session_id( md5(microtime().$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']));
session_start();
$_SESSION = $tmp_SESSION;
unset($tmp_SESSION);


Cheers,
Jerry

Have you looked at the info.php file for lots of setup details or try...

find / -name php.ini -print
find / -type f -print | grep php.ini

These commands are searching the whole box from the root up. 
You will get permission denied messages on dirs you do not have rights
on.
Execution can take awhile. But you'll dig it up.
Is that what you are asking about?

That is kinda what I don't understand, via php you should be able to use
the -d flag to report the ini values?

php -d register_globals

>From -h:
-d foo[=bar]     Define INI entry foo with value 'bar'

I was under the impression that it could/would invoke ini_get() and
ini_alter() respectively but it just hangs (on W32).

Hi,

Just wanted to point out that the list is losing my responses every now and
then. No bounce back, no errors.  My two responses to "mySQL optimization"
thread disappeared.


One of them was from my main account and the other one from a ghost account.
Both of them were sent using IncrediMail, plain text format.  Not sure if it
is my program, or something else.

Hmm, that's a toughy, as it's really DB dependant.  For instance, Oracle
maintains a data dictionary which I believe is where this type of information
is stored (which is cached into memory upon instance startup).  In MySQL I
don't think there is the same notion of a data dictionary, so this type of
info is stored on the filesystem, internal to the table file set itself;
however, since MySQL caches tables that have been opened (not their contents,
just pertinent statistics, ie data dictionary stuff) it'll be just as fast as
Oracle (and certainly much less memory intensive).

Hard to say; since there aren't any obvious sys tables, I'd imagine it works
in a similar fashion to MySQL.

Then again, this might be all false since I haven't looked at the data
structures for MySQL  :)

This is typically used to *set* ini directives, which will then be used
during the script run.

I'm not sure why it would hang, but then I have never done it on windows.

Also take a look at:

http://us2.php.net/ini_get
http://us2.php.net/ini_get_all
http://us2.php.net/parse_ini_file

depending on what you need to accomplish.

Hmm, quite odd.  I always get a notification message if a message arrives
that isn't processible, rejected, etc.

Yeah, that seems like a kosher config.  Maybe their mail queue got stuck? 
Let me know if it continues to be an issue.

I am getting a parse error setting up an array.  I have a get_browser()

to fail upon array creation.  Bluntly put, what did I do wrong?

That looks weird to me for several reasons.  Perhaps you mean:

   $browser = array($key => $val);

In general, in the future, copy and paste the error message, including the 
file and line, then tell us which line numbers of the script you're 
showing us (and make sure to import the exact script to your email, not a 
retyping of it, which it looks like you may have done here.

Hey Folks:

Following up on the earlier thread regarding count() in MySQL.  It touched
on MS Access and system tables.  I deleted the messages but still wanted
to mention...

Access does have system tables.  Exactly what they do, I don't know.  They 
can be seen by going to Tools | Options | View Tab, then checking "System 
Objects."

Ok I will do the best I can, although it won't make the problem clearer (at
least to me):

Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in
/users/ppowell/web/profile/display.php on line 92

Line 92: 
foreach ($browser as $key => $val) 
     echo "$key = $val<br>";

Furthermore I do not understand

$browserArray = array($key, $val);

I have never seen that before, and honestly, I come from the TCL background
of this: [set $browserArray($key) $val] -> this is why I associate an array
element setting that way.  

Bottom Line: I am trying to detect if the user is using Javascript from a
server-side perspective.

I'll bet $browser isn't an array.

Dude, did you write the exact syntax I wrote?  No.

The syntax you wrote makes an enumerated array with two values.  What I 
think you really want to be doing is creating an associative array with 
one key value pair.  Right?  So, use "$key => $val" instead of "$key, 
$val"

But, since you're pulling stuff from the $browser array already, why are 
you creating a second array with the same exact data?  I suspect you're 
off course...


> I have never seen that before

The manual is an excellent resource.  Have you looked at the array 
section?  Finding it is as simple as typing "php.net/array" into most web 
browsers.

Jerry,
Why do you do this?
Doesn't PHP 4.2.x and higher create session ids properly?
Or do you need a specific id for your specific circumstance?

I can't find anything on the new session_regenerate_id() finction yet.
However if it does what I think it does, here is what I've been using in
it's place:

// at this point the session is already open
$tmp_SESSION = $_SESSION;
session_unset();
session_destroy();

session_id(
md5(microtime().$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']));
session_start();
$_SESSION = $tmp_SESSION;
unset($tmp_SESSION);


Cheers,
Jerry

Subject: Anyone ever have any luck with get_browser()?
Message-ID: <265000-220035530161626928@M2W094.mail2web.com>

taken from http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php

object get_browser ( [string user_agent])


get_browser() attempts to determine the capabilities of the user's browser.
This is done by looking up the browser's information in the browscap.ini
file. By default, the value of HTTP_USER_AGENT is used; however, you can
alter this (i.e., look up another browser's info) by passing the optional
user_agent parameter to get_browser(). 

The information is returned in an object, which will contain various data
elements representing, for instance, the browser's major and minor version
numbers and ID string; TRUE/FALSE values for features such as frames,
JavaScript, and cookies; and so forth. 

While browscap.ini contains information on many browsers, it relies on user
updates to keep the database current. The format of the file is fairly
self-explanatory. 

The following example shows how one might list all available information
retrieved about the user's browser. Example 1. get_browser() example

<?php
echo $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "<hr />\
";

$browser = get_browser();

foreach ($browser as $name => $value) {
    print "<b>$name</b> $value <br />\
";
}

?>
 
 


The output of the above script would look something like this: 

Mozilla/4.5 [en] (X11; U; Linux 2.2.9 i586)<hr />
<b>browser_name_pattern:</b> Mozilla/4\\.5.*<br />

I am using the PHP manual itself to define the get_browser() object as an
array.  However, when I do it I get the following error:

Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in
/users/ppowell/web/profile/display.php on line 8

Here is my code, lines 5-9:


   // DETERMINE IF THE USER'S BROWSER HAS JAVASCRIPT BY REARRANGING THE
get_browser() OBJECT AS AN ARRAY
   $browser = get_browser();
   foreach ($browser as $key => $val) {
    $browserArray = array($key, $val);
   }


-----------------------------------------------------

I hope this gives a more thorough background of what I have done to try to
determine the user's browser Javascript setting.

But what happens if you do

<?php
$browser = get_browser();
print_r($browser);
?>

I'll bet not much, since it seems from the message that $browser isn't an 
array.  So, if that's the case, it means get_browser() isn't working right 
for you.

Of course, you realize, that just because a browser CAN use JavasCrap, 
doesn't mean the person has it enabled.  And that relying on JS for 
essential things can lead to your site being unusable for such people.  
See my rant at http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/weberror.htm about 
this if you care.

There's an ini setting in your way, probably. There is for me.

Well, maybe what I am trying to convey is this: I want to know if the user
has Javascript enabled on their browser; if they don't, then a submit
button appears, otherwise, it doesn't have to.  There is no clean
client-side solution to this dilemma; I've never seen successful
client-side plugin-enabling display handling ever done.

Well I was hoping for a more elegant display solution of not showing the
submit button if javascript is enabled, nonetheless, it ain't worth it. 
But thanx for the suggestions.  I think I'll steer clear of get_browser();
it's a waste.

I would also point out that the HTTP_USER_AGENT can be modified on the
user's machine. I've read that even MSIE can have it's identity changed via
the registry, so I agree it is pretty useless. Especially when browsers like
Konqueror make it so easy to mask the true identity. What about using an
image as a submit trigger? Or use CSS to modify the look of your buttons. I
know the default look isn't very appealing... just some suggestions.

this might work better..

foreach($browser as $key => $val){

	$browserArray[$key] = $val;
}

print_r($browserArray);

or just

if($browser->javascript == 1)
{
	include ("javascript_enabled_page");
}
else
	include("no_java_script");
}

Tried that, but $browser->javascript comes out to be null on my browser

um... that link gets a 404.

and howabout creating a link that goes right to an unsubscribe form?	

and the mailing list link has nothing on unsubscribing...

as always its all about the interface and NOT about the enduser.

It seems like this will help you:

$browser = get_browser( );
if( $browser->javascript == 1 ) {
    // JavaScript is enabled
} else {
  // It's not
}

...because get_browser returns an *object*, not an *array*.  Even
though the example in the get_browser documentation seems to suggest
that foreach will do what it looks like it should, there are some
caveats to be read in the documentation of foreach.  And, anyway, you
don't care about the rest of the object; all you care about is that
one field.

However, I haven't done much at all with objects in PHP, so YMMV.

I do this to prevent session hijacking. This trick changes the session id while preserving the session's persistence.
However, unconditional use this snippet can cause some problems.  For example, using the browser's reload/refresh button on a client with cookies disabled may cause the session to be lost.  I use this code as a part of a larger and knotty session security algorithm and hope that the new session_regenerate_id() will do a much better job.

Cheers,
Jerry

This submission breaks it:

Strips some attibutes:<br>
<img src='http://fotola.com/berylium/csnyder/?method=latestimage'
onmouseover='whatever(whatever="onmouseover='
alert("gotcha");
alert("I can do anything in here"); 
'/>

Note, it also breaks your page, so the exploit will not be obvious
unless you verify that the attempted "safe" HTML doesn't work by
putting it on a page by itself.  

Your program needs to verify that after it strips the HTML it hasn't
generated unsafe HTML, and it needs a way to avoid getting caught in a
loop doing that.  This is the sort of programming challenge that I
like to model with a state machine.

Not anymore. Two things happened there-- I needed to create separate 
patterns for attributes delimited with " and with ', and I didn't 
realize that the dot wasn't matching newline chars. Fixed both of those, 
and thanks for the shakedown!!

http://chxo.com/scripts/safe_html-test.php

It's also closing open tags now, but without any sort of pretense to 
well-formed HTML-- it just tacks the appropriate number of closing tags 
on at the end. My goal is to brute-force protect against people who 
might want to break the page visually, not correct a poster's formatting.

I took a crash course in state machines this evening via Google, and I 
must admit that I have no idea what this problem would like if modeled 
as one. It's true that I would be happier with mathematical proof that 
the routine was unexploitable, but anecdotal proof will be enough for me 
to allow HTML posts in non-critical applications. Thanks again for 
testing it!

I can now break it with this input:         

Strips some attibutes:<br />
<img src='http://fotola.com/berylium/csnyder/?method=latestimage'
onmouseover=onmouseover='alert("gotcha")''alert("gotcha");
alert("I can also do multiple lines!");' title='a photo' />
<blink>blink!</blink>
<b>adds <b>closing</b> tags if necessary.

My pleasure, and thank you for putting your code out there for review.
I think it's a good lesson to see how hard it is to sanitize user input, even
starting with a lot of initial cleverness. 

I think at minimum you need to loop over the resulting output to
verify that you haven't transformed your input into an output which
still triggers your conditions for requiring modification.

One thing you might want to do is add extraneous spaces around things
you've expunged, which might prevent parts from joining together around
an expunged piece.  This should generally be ok, because most legitimate
HTML shouldn't care about whitespaces.

Now I'm getting the picture -- I think the shortcut out of this might be 
to strip all tags if any of the attribute patterns match in the first 
place. It's not worth the CPU cycles to be kind to the one user in a 
million who means no harm with an onmouseover event.

Oh the sanity!

strip_attributes() now loops back over the html, checking for new exploits created by the replacements. If any are found it decides the post is malicious and strips all HTML tags.

Same thing with the src='javascript: checks in safe_html().

Here's a weird one:

I'm using $HTTP_SESSION_VARS to store all the session stuff I need,
and it works just fine until I call a function.  Within just about any
function I call, the values stored in that array seem to disappear.  I
know this is some vague information, and I'll provide more code if
needed, but does this trigger any gotchas for anyone?

Can't you pass that as an argument?

I pass variables as arguments through functions, so I don't mix up my

Never mind.  :)  After some debugging and RTFMing, I realized that I
need to use "global" within functions, for stuff that was declared

Unlike $_SESSION, that's not a superglobal.

Bingo.  But I'd much prefer using $_SESSION, even if your version of PHP
doesn't support them yet, in which case alias $_SESSION to
$HTTP_SESSION_VARS.  It'll save work in the future.

This submission breaks it:

Strips some attibutes:<br>
<img src='http://fotola.com/berylium/csnyder/?method=latestimage'
onmouseover='whatever(whatever="onmouseover='
alert("gotcha");
alert("I can do anything in here"); 
'/>

Note, it also breaks your page, so the exploit will not be obvious
unless you verify that the attempted "safe" HTML doesn't work by
putting it on a page by itself.  

Your program needs to verify that after it strips the HTML it hasn't
generated unsafe HTML, and it needs a way to avoid getting caught in a
loop doing that.  This is the sort of programming challenge that I
like to model with a state machine.

I would have to agree with Gary on this one.  As far as I can tell, if 
you're processing a million xml files, you're going to be limited by 
hardware requirements on your Windows box; if you want to speed the i/o 
up, get a Cheetah or more processor power/RAM.  If you do the coding for 
the xml dump on the fly, you're going to cut down your access time 
signficantly (I would imagine).  As it is, even just reading the file 
directory of a million files is going to hang (or crash!) your PC.

Hi Larry,

What are you trying to do with the files?
