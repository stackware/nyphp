Subject: [nycphp-talk] Uploading files through a form and then emailing them
Message-ID: <20040101172501.85950.qmail@mail.com>

Hi,
I'm Stephen.  I do a little PHP, but I am not proficient with it. 

I am looking for information on how to implement the following.

I have an HTML form with a 4 fields to upload files.  When the person submits the form, I want to be able to take all the files in the file fields and email them to someone.

Is there a code snippet or some place where I can learn more about how I could implement this?

Thanks,
Stephen

Stephen,

Check out http://php.net/features.file-upload for handling file uploads.

A bit of Googling and I found this:

http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/

Don't have any experience with the PHPMailer but it may be worth a 
closer look.

Nice work Jeff, I haven't done too much with email, but PHPMailer looks 
like a very powerful tool for any PHP coder.

If the php.ini is sparse, here are some 
excerpts from a suggested ini (as a 
reminder)

; The root of the PHP pages, used only if nonempty.
; if PHP was not compiled with FORCE_REDIRECT, you SHOULD set doc_root
; if you are running php as a CGI under any web server (other than IIS)
; see documentation for security issues.  The alternate is to use the

can
; turn it off here AT YOUR OWN RISK
; **You CAN safely turn this off for IIS, in fact, you MUST.**
; cgi.force_redirect = 1

Maybe it wouldn't hurt to make sure php was compiled with
FORCE_REDIRECT and explicitly set cgi.redirect = 1.

Tim,

I thought I'd sift through these 
(http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/php-src/php.ini-recommended) to find the 
optimal setting and making adjustments for version as needed (I'll be 
using ver. 4.3.2).

Q: Can I simply overwrite the php.ini that's in cgi-bin?

I checked phpinfo() and it was compiled with 
"--enable-force-cgi-redirect=yes". Thanks for pointing this out. There 
was a reference to this in 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.cgi-bin.php in the context of 
Apache config.

Happy New Year!!

you check for where php is reading its ini file from
[e.g. phpinfo -- Configuration File (php.ini) Path ]

If I were doing it, I would make sure I could read and 
write to that directory, do an ls -l and see the 
permissions and ownership of the php.ini 
(and write it down) then rename the php.ini to 
php.ini.old and then put the new php.ini file in the 
directory.

I hesitate to tell you everything will be fine -- 
but if you're certain you could put things back the way 
they were, then I don't see any major problem.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] tracking down memory leaks
Message-ID: <3FF49976.6020508@chxo.com>

I've noticed recently that httpd has been eating about 10MB an hour on
my server. I'm not sure whether the problem is in Apache, PHP, some
other library, or my own code -- I just know that apachectl restart
frees everything up again.

What are some best practices for tracking this sort of thing down?  I'm
using ps -uaxm along with mod_status to try and get an idea which PIDs
are taking up the most memory and what they're working on, but it's not
been very enlightening so far.

Apache 1.3.29 / PHP 4.3 / FreeBSD 4.8

Thanks,

Thanks for the leads. 

phpMailer looks like overkill, but I'll have to read more into it.  I wish it had more examples, as the ones there are for extracted data from a database.

Don't have any experience with the PHPMailer but it may be worth a

Since you are using pretty stable version of apache I doubt problem is
with that. You should be using php version 4.3.4 but its not clear if
you are still using 4.3.0 from you post. Are you using most stable
version of php ?

Dear Sirs,
Am responsible for dotgeek.org a small albeit promising site about php 
and open source platforms.

We recently published the results of our first PHP Programming Marathon 
(which was kindly sponsored by Zend and Suse) at
http://marathon.dotgeek.org

We are planning to open soon a tutorials section.  There is an idea of 
preparing a PHP certification system where in lieu of evaluating the 
performance on a standard questionnaire, we do evaluate the programmers 
skills based on 10 code samples or tutorials posted on our site.

I am currently looking for some PHP experts to join the board. This 
will imply an occasional review of the programmers that posted 10+ 
tutorials/snippets via an online system.

  (To clarify, all certifications will be offered free, the site has no 
ads and is entirely self financed. I am not doing this as a business or 
something).

if anyone of your staff or user group is interested, please let me 
know. You might find below our first draft with the information on the 
current board members.

Thanks in advance for your time and attention

David


dotGeek PHP Programming Certification

	The system allows you to post tutorials in order to earn a 
certification in
PHP.  We have a well qualified certification board that will analyze all
postings.  The system works as follows:

	1) You have the ability to upload tutorials in the system for
certification.
		You have ability to develop tutorials for any purpose to post to this
site.  With that you will submit the purpose or functionality of that
tutorial.  You may submit as many as you want.  Be sure all submitted
tutorials only use classes that are inherent in PHP or are submitted 
with
the tutorial.  A user with just PHP 4.? should be able to take your 
code and
run it without having to load extra packages.
	2) After you have posted 10 quality tutorials you will have the 
ability to
request certification.
		You will select 10 of the tutorials you have posted to be evaluated.

sure these 10 tutorials fit the criteria stated below.
	3) The certification board will evaluate the tutorials according to the
criteria described below.
		The certification board will respond within 30 business days as to 
whether
the 10 tutorials posted all pass.  The names and qualifications of the
members of this board are below.
	4) If you pass the certification you will have access to an electronic
certificate and receive an email containing the certificate.
		For submitting 10 quality tutorials, you will be sent an electronic
certification indicating you are a certified PHP developer.  This along 
with
your tutorials can be used to enhance your resume and indicate your 
skill
set to your current or future employers.

	The following is the criteria used to determine whether you should be
certified as a PHP developer.

	1) Tutorial accomplishes its purpose.
		Attached to the tutorials is a description of the tutorial's
functionality.  The written tutorial must accomplish all goals set 
forth by
the programmer. A programmer must be able to understand what they wrote 
and
describe it to a fellow programmer or even someone who does not program.
	2) Cleanliness/Readability of code.
		Programmers need to make their code easy to hand off to other 
programmers
either for continued development or to help debug.  This is done through
comments and extra spacing to make statements readable.
	3) Error handling.
		This is important for PHP because it is often implemented in web 
pages and
crashing code can help hackers understand what is in the PHP script.  
Users
hate crashing code (they dislike it more than error messages).

PHP Certification Board
	The PHP Certification Board is made up of people with varying 
backgrounds
in the PHP development industry.  They are in charge of looking through
posted tutorials and making sure that they fit the above stated 
criteria.
The following are the members of the current PHP Certification Board:

David Costa
Job: Associate Professor at a Swiss private College
Qualifications: Law School graduate (Law School, University of 
Northumbria at Newcastle), Stanford Certified Project Manager (School 
of Engineering, Stanford University) EDP, (Sloan School of Management,

Hi,

$PHP_SELF will not work if you have register_global off.

It is safer to use $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']

Thanks, Felix -- I was still with 4.3.3, somehow the 4.3.4 update 
slipped through the cracks.

It'll be a few hours before I know about the memory leak, but upgrading 
has fixed a segfault I just discovered this morning.

I'd also consider recommending another of Larry Ullman's 
books: "PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites"
Unlike his earlier books, this one uses good coding style 
and it's good for beginners too.


I've also used "Web Database Applications with PHP & MySQL" 
by Hugh E. Williams and David Lane
This one features a nice case study as its theme, but I 
would not recommend it for beginners since it's a fairly 
typical O'Reilly book in that regard.

Message-ID: <20040103050438.51026.qmail@mail.com>

Hi,
I was trying to use the file uploading aspect of PHP.

When I tried to execute this line
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadFile)

I get a permission denied error.

$_FILES['userfile']['errors'] is equal to 0, which indicates the file was uploaded to the temp directory of the host, so I think it either couldn't copy it to where I wanted (my user directory) or copy out of the tmp directory.  Running phpinfo() in my user directory indicates that file_uploads is ON and safe_mode is OFF on the server.

I don't own the server, so I don't think I can give PHP permission, or can I?

Do I have any way around this?

Thanks,
Stephen

It sounds like you do have a permissions problem.

You will need to make sure that the webserver process (usually www-data 
for apache) has permissions to write to the directory where you want to 
put the uploaded file.

A simple test is to create a new directory and set permissions to 
rwxrwxrwx (chmod 777), then try to move the file there.  If it works 
then you know what your problem is.

As for fixing the permissions, you are going to have to figure out a 
setting which gives the webserver the access it needs, without causing 
any security problems.  There are several different ways to do it, one 
method is to set the group of the directory to www-data and use the 
group permission setting to control the access you want to give to php.

Hope this helps,

Dan

PHP running as a CGI (or CLI) can specify it's own php.ini for the most
part.

Directives not specified default to their internal PHP setting (as if
there was no php.ini at all).

I assume you know why that's the case. ;-)

Try trolling around the various blogging sites (Blogger, MoveableType, 
etc) -- very often the designers who create templates for these systems 
are willing to let you use them elsewhere.

Also, I believe that all of the excellent stylesheets at the CSS Zen 
Garden are available under a Creative Commons license:

I thought of that. Time is an issue (I'm leaving in a few days) and I 
know I have to jump through a hoop or two to get it to run on the laptop.

As long as we're making irrational suggestions for a last-minute trip,

But seriously, it's not so difficult to get AMP running on a Win laptop.

This will require the PHP 5 book author to get his act in
order. Luckily, there was just a new year and resolutions to go along
with it.

Hello!
if you are interested in Linux easy install of Apache,PHP,MySQL, SQLite 
it might be worth to have a look at Collegelinux:

"CollegeLinux 2.5 (http://linux.college.ch ) codenamed "Obi Wan", is an 
easy to use Linux distribution based on Slackware.

Obiwan comes ready for php development and is the only linux 
distribution so far to do this. 
apache/php/mysql/sqlite/phpmyadmin/sqlitemanger/webmin come 
preinstalled, with a one-step configuration via our own tool, called CL 
server robot.

Not content with just providing the server side, the distro also comes 
with Kdevelop, an IDE that works natively with PHP in a fully 
functional desktop environment.

After a CollegeLinux installation everything you need for developing in 
PHP is setup for you: your server will be up and running and you can 
easily change any of the settings via webmin, a user-friendly graphical 
control panel."

Hi!

EasyPHP should work on your laptop.  I have "EasyPHP" installed
on a 380MHZ AMD K-2 computer running Win98.  It works OK.  If
you know how to tweak "php.ini" for things like timeouts and
warnings you should be OK.  It does not run as fast as if it is
on an AMD Altheon but it will work OK.  

It also installs easily.  I run "Moodle" ( http://moodle.org )
and  "phpNUKE" ( http://phpNUKE.org ). 

Make sure you install the program off the "C" directory and not
the "Program Files" directory.  So after the install you should
have,
C:\EasyPHP1-7
and not
C\:Program Files\EasyPHP1-7

Make sure you read the following install tutorial before
installing the program.

Don't know how you are getting to your final destination, but maybe doing
the install on the plane would be a good way to pass the time.

Probably the biggest hoop would be getting the ISOs or CDs in time (unless
you bought a packaged set).

Whenever I've done a linux install, it hasn't taken more than an hour (not
including disk error checking), if that.

The most common problem I've had with laptops has been with the video
drivers, but that can all be tweaked post-install.

Now I have a dilemma...I downloaded both easyphp and Xampp.
I'll toss a coin to figure out which one to install (once, of course, I 
find the darned network card dongle!).

Here's a file for phpTest I've modified to add SQLite 
support.  It illustrates a way of handling different escape 
methods depending on whether magic_quotes_gpc is on or off.
The next step is to convert it to use ADODB.

you're welcome to post the prep_vars() snippet or whatever

Thanks for the code John,

It is really preferable to take care of magic_quotes_gpc at the 
beginning of the script, rather than at the time of insertion into the 
database.  By doing it that way any validation, redisplay, etc of 
submitted data can be done without needing to worry about the effects of 
magic_quotes.

 From the looks of your code it should be very easy to convert it into 
an ADOdb wrapper library.

Agree.  Since this was an add-on, I wanted to do all the db 
sensitive stuff in one place.  I have an aversion to testing 
for the type of database in other places.  In this case, it 
seemed the quickest way of dropping in SQLite support 
without regard to how a sever's php.ini file may be set up.

Ideally, all 'magic' stuff should be "off" as in the 
php-recommended file

Hi there,

I think that there's 3 points that need clarification:
<http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/5.php?expiredate=1/19/2004&topicnumber=5>

(1) "Best Practice: Do not use the function addslashes but, instead, use a
function that is specific to your database."

Could the tutorial elaborate a little bit more on this? I have been using
addslashes with Mysql with no problems and the tutorial doesn't convince me why
I should change to mysql_escape_string/mysql_real_escape_string.

(2) htmlentities/htmlspecialchars

I think the tutorial should insist that the best practice is not using these
functions on data that you want to *insert* in a database.

(3) "You will notice that two commands - addslashes and stripslashes - are
conspicously absent from this article. If you follow our best practice
recommendations, there is no need to use either one of these functions in the
situations that have been examined."

The bit on stripslashes need also some clarification. Every time I insert some
values in Mysql, I use addslashes, and when I want to get back these values from
the database, I always use stripslashes on these values but the tutorial makes
me realize now how stupid I am and that there's no need in fact to use
stripslashes in this case.  I don't know where I got this idea, but anyway, I'm
sure many people felt in this trap.

Anyway, thanks for the tutorial, I learned something :).

PS: My spell checker (Grammarian/OS X) flagged 'conspicously' and wanted
'conspicuously' instead.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

Message-ID: <002d01c3d3b4$c77a9760$bf8d3818@oberon1>


Last month there was some discussion to the effect 
of "what was in their [the php developers'] mind 
when they created 'magic quotes'? "
(why does PHP have this feature[?] at all?)

I was doing something else over the weekend, when I 
ran across the following thread:

Sara Golemon wrote (20 Feb 2003):

"I recall a discussion sometime back about making 
file_put_contents()(create a file and write the provided 
contents to it in one command)...
Was it decided not to create these..."

http://www.zend.com/lists/php-dev/200302/msg00522.html

Following the thread can give you an insight (of sorts) 
into the collective mind of people working on PHP.

If this sort of thing interests you at all, I suggest you 
follow the thread at least to where Sascha Schumann says:

"That must be one of the most useless function proposals 
I've seen so far. Now, if the function could atomically 
replace file contents, then it would be something entirely 
different.

But a simple wrapper for a two-line fopen/fputs?  Get real."

But I encourage you to follow the thread to where Rasmus 
Lerdorf says: 

"I do agree with Sascha that file_put_contents() 
as it is currently proposed is useless"

Then take a look at the following:

FWIW, magic quotes dates back forever, all the way back to January 24,
1996. This means it's 8th birthday is later this month! That's version
1.99a of PHP. I'm sure it seemed helpful to Rasmus at the time. ;)

Oddly enough, I would say the majority of people who develop PHP
haven't actually used PHP in years. They used to use PHP, but got
bored writing Web pages and moved onto language development (err... or
writing books.)

This is, IMHO, a serious issue, but I haven't figured out how to fix
it. Suggestions are welcome.

Addslashes will escape " (double quote), ' (single quote) \ (backslash) 
and NUL (the null byte) with a backslash.

mysql_real_escape_string will take into account the character set of the 
current connection, and escape characters as appropriate.  Both 
mysql_escape_string and mysql_real_escape_string will also quote 
instances of other characters which are 'special' in mysql, including:

\0
An ASCII 0 (NUL) character.
\'
A single quote (`'') character.
\"
A double quote (`"') character.
\b
A backspace character.
\n
A newline character.
\r
A carriage return character.
\t
A tab character.
\z
ASCII(26) (Control-Z). This character can be encoded to allow you to 
work around the problem that ASCII(26) stands for END-OF-FILE on 
Windows. (ASCII(26) will cause problems if you try to use mysql database 
< filename.)
\\
A backslash (`\') character.

In addition, they will encode any newlines into their encoded (\n or 
\r\n) counterpart.

All of the database-specific functions included these kinds of special 
cases for the particular database, whereas addslashes does not.  For 
simple data it will work, but sooner or later you are going to end up in 
a situation where addslashes alone will fail.

This is very true, I think that the article makes this fairly clear. 
This is not a matter of best practice, but something that should 
(almost) never be done.

Conspicuously is correct.

First of all, this looks to be another great phundamentals article. I
really like this series (or whatever you want to call it).

I agree with Emmanuel that some elaboration would be useful here. Whenever
a best practice is seldom followed, a very clear justification can be a
great thing. Being right and convincing someone else that you're right are
often very different things. :-)

> (2) htmlentities/htmlspecialchars
> 
> I think the tutorial should insist that the best practice is not using
> these functions on data that you want to *insert* in a database.

More elaboration in general might be good. I would consider these
functions the "least you can do" when you're displaying potentially
tainted data to the user. If you're not displaying data, htmlentities()
probably isn't going to offer you the type of protection you seek.

There are also two different opinions on this:

1. Perform htmlentities() prior to storage.
2. Perform htmlentities() prior to display.

The first can be better if you must display data in HTML very often.
Rather than perform htmlentities() every time, you can just pull straight
from the database. 

The second is usually best if you have other uses for the data besides
displaying it in HTML. It is also best if your security model revolves
around cleaning up data the moment it enters into your application. This
can be a good approach in terms of keeping things simple for your
developers.

The best thing to do in general would be to validate your data according
to exactly what it is supposed to be. I'm not creative enough to think of
a way to inject some XSS that subverts htmlentities(), but it seems like
something that might be possible. Also, adhering to strong security
practices is a good idea in general, since such things can potentially
protect you from attacks that you're not even aware of.

Probably because conspicously is not a word. :-)

Nevertheless it would seem that they would still

If a proposed function is useless and adds
bloat, why put it in PHP 5?

FWIW, I believe data should be "display-agnostic" for want 
of a better term.  Keeping it "raw" is, in my opinion, the 
way to handle stored data.

Yes, and this is why some people argue for case 2. However, believe me
when I tell you that once you are having to fetch and display this data
millions of times a day, you might find yourself being a bit more
open-minded. :-)

I think it's best to choose whichever approach is appropriate for the
situation.

The nice thing about 30+ years in the computer business is

The only advantage to this method is the speed increase, you still need 
to use addslashes, it takes up more space in the database, and it is 
only useful if you will only ever be outputting HTML.

This is the recommended procedure.  For the vast majority of scripts the 
speed difference is negligible, especially when the added overhead in 
retrieving the html encoded data from the database is taken into account.

htmlentities is designed to prevent ANY characters which have special 
meaning in HTML from being inserted without conversion.  The only way 
you could 'subvert' it in a document would be to exploit a bug in the 
function itself (ie a character which it does not convert.  I would very 
much doubt if this is even possible).

You are absolutely correct though that any data submitted by a user 
should be subject to some form of error checking/cleaning before it it 
used for any purpose.

Absolutely right! (No sarcasm intended!)

Just a general clarification to all concerning the "PHundamentals."

First, the general philosophy is to offer what the NYPHP community 
believes is "best practice." Of course, there are always exceptions to 
any rule depending on circumstance. However, we're trying to create some 
rules so that when you *do* have to break a rule...you know what rule 
you are violating.

Second, each article goes through a "beta phase" (see the note that 
appears at the bottom of the article) and this type of discussion is 
exactly what is needed to make sure that the final version addresses the 
majority of concerns.

They do care about the language, it's just their motivations aren't
necessarily aligned with users of the language. Nor do they
necessarily understand what many users are trying to do with PHP.

I can replicate the majority of the functions in PHP using more low
level functions and operators, but that doesn't mean those functions
are useless and bloated.

In this case, I think it makes perfect sense to have
file_put_contents() if there's a file_get_contents().

Also, why would you want to subject people to C/Unix's fopen(),
fwrite(), and fclose() when all they want to do is save stuff? That
seems horribly tortured.

I agree on all points, and I'm a big fan of stuff like
file_get_contents(). In fact, I think there should be a
mysql_connect_and_then_query_and_then_fetch_array() function. :-)

Could that be shortened to mysql_kvetch? ;)

The bloat stuff I was referring to was:
"
    Oh, come on.  Put it into a utility library; this does not
    belong into the core of PHP.  Or is your argument "we already
    have so much bloat, a bit more is ok, too"?

    - Sascha "
from:
http://www.zend.com/lists/php-dev/200302/msg00551.html


Rasmus agreed (at least at one time) as previously 
noted that the function was useless.

"I do agree with Sascha that file_put_contents() 
as it is currently proposed is useless. People aren't 
currently writing inefficient code to emulate this 
behaviour so we aren't fixing a file/implode fiasco here.  
We do not need a core function 
to replace fopen(); fputs(); fclose()."

 see:
http://www.zend.com/lists/php-dev/200302/msg00559.html

It seemed to me that the function hadn't changed from 
the way it was proposed.

I don't know maybe they just changed their minds.

Message-ID: <20040106041535.10756.qmail@mail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to print out the contents of the $errorMessage array in this heredoc, but if I don't put the double quotes around the variable, PHP gives me an error.  If I use the double quotes and the variable happens to be empty, I get "" in the page, which is not what I want.

How do I fix this?

Message-ID: <20040106042513.22829.qmail@mail.com>

I made a mistake.  I noticed that in order to evaluate variables, I have to use them without any additional quotes.  So if I'm dealing with an array, I have t remove the internal quotes.

I originally had $errorMessage["username"] and PHP was complaining about that format.

I presume this is the way it is supposed to work.

Sorry about that.

You need to use curly braces in this case, and you should be quoting 
your array keys.

For Example:

<tr>
<td class="submissionfield">Name:</td>
<td><input type="text" name="username" 
size="30"/>{$errorMessage['username']}</td>
</tr>

That should solve your problem.

A better way may be be to use a loop:

echo '<form action="' . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . '" method="post" 
enctype="multipart/form-data">' . "\n";

$fields = array (
	'username' => array (
		'title' => 'Name',
		'field' => '<input type="text" name="username" size="30" />'
	),
	'email' => array (
		'title' => 'Email Address',
		'field' => '<input type="text" name="email" size="30" />'
	)
);

echo '<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" class="submissionstable">' 
. "\n";

foreach ( $fields as $field_id => $field )
{
	echo '<tr><td class="submissionfield">' . $field['name'] . ':</td><td>' 
. $field['field'] . ' ' . $errorMessage[$field_id] . '</td></tr>' . "\n";
}

echo '</table>' . "\n";
echo '</form>' . "\n";

This makes it very easy to add extra fields, or change format of the HTML.

Using this syntax will work for simple arrays, but it is generally 
preferable to use the curly brackets syntax, as it will also work with 
object variables, etc.

This is not good to keep 777 permission to your images (or any other file)
as it is hazardous and can cause severe problem if someone can access your
file system. Assigning permission 777 to any file may eliminate your problem
temporarily but eventually not suitable to carry on solving your problems
with this permission. Try to assing appropriate permission to your files
which is actually required and can keep them safe from being deleted or
misused. Read artilces about securiy and file permission on any good PHP
site or contact your server administrator for more information.

...which takes an array of scumbags as argument and returns a wad of cash
on success -- ooh, I like it.

It would be nice if it took an optional callback (e.g.,break_their_legs())
to be called on failure.

If the comment period isn't over yet, I have $.02.

You might mention that if you happen to be using PEAR DB library, you
might as well use quote(), or prepare() and execute(), which take care of
correctly quoting the values represented by ? in parameterized SQL
statements.

P.S. Since I don't use PEAR, the question is, which one of the functions 
are used for escaping data? All three? Since the major focus is on 
MySQL, is there one that is MySQL-specific?

In PEAR the closest 'equivalent' is probably quote (), the other 2 
functions are much more powerful tools.

The same goes for ADODB, you can use qstr () or the PEAR compatible 
quote ().

One thing to note about these functions is that they will not only 
escape the strings but will quote them as well.

The beauty of them is that they are smart enough to determine what needs 
to be done for the particular database, so you don't need to worry about 
them being MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc specific.

DB::quote() (and I quote) "[q]uotes a string database-dependent, so it can
be safely used in a query." They mean, it quotes it correctly for the
backend db that you connected to when you called connect() and got a $db
object. They further say the currently supported database backends are
MySQL, PostgreSQL, InterBase, Mini SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle
7/8/8i, ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), SyBase, Informix, FrontBase.

prepare() and execute() perform more or less comparably to their
counterparts in JDBC and Perl DBI.

I'm now maintaining PEAR DB.  Exactly what quote() -- and potentiall new
similar methods -- is going to do is under discussion.  The last release 
has different behaviors for different databases.

While all db's get the string escaped, some db's return everything quoted 
(with "'" around them) while numeric _strings_ and/or _variables_ passed 
to the method may or may not get quotes around them.

Under MySQL, ODBC, PostgreSQL full magic was in effect based on the PHP
data type of the variable passed to the method.  I've committed several
changes to apply this behavior to most backends.  This raised cackles from
some about forward compatibility and too much magic, so the final behavior
has yet to be determined.

I'm leaning to having all of them do the magic and have the same default 
behavior without creating yet another method.  

We'll see...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Form Generation and Processing
Message-ID: <E1AdwRM-0002D9-Po@server1057.webserver33.com>

Now that I'm finally back to work, I've taken a look at my framework and
decided to take it all apart and put it back together again for the 1500th
time.  I figure some of you can relate (humor my sanity).
 
My latest idea for an addition came to me from a recent project.  I work
with a few very talented designers and I want to give them as much control
over the forms as possible on the site.  I personally avoid template systems
and just go the php var route, and try my very BEST to keep the absolute
minimum of php code inside the html (besides vars and basic conditionals).
 
What I ended up doing for the form was set it all up in html and created a
class (super basic now while testing the idea - no error checkingor anyhting
yet) for setting the values of the form fields.  I'll be using ADOdb, so for
new forms, I grab all the field's default values from the db.  For
edit/update forms, I grab the record's data, and for errors, I replace the
form values array with the $_REQUEST array.  So I give the designer a list
of form fields and he puts them where he wants.  The 'save' script uses
adodb's update and insert functions to update only the form values passed,
which essentially allows the designer to remove form fields as they please.
 
Working example:
http://www.enobrev.com/form/index.php
<BLOCKED::http://www.enobrev.com/form/index.php> 
 
Code of example:
http://www.enobrev.com/form/index_code.php
<BLOCKED::http://www.enobrev.com/form/index_code.php> 
 
Code for basic class, thrown together for testing the idea (in otherwords,
just an idea):
http://www.enobrev.com/form/class_code.php
<BLOCKED::http://www.enobrev.com/form/class_code.php> 
 
So am I completely insane in thinking a designer would understand adding
vars like that to their html?  I know I should ask them and I plan to as I
figure out how it will all work, but I'm also asking you guys as
professionals about what you think of the idea of form control without
actaully controlling the form output, only the names and values (and
optionally the options of a select).
 
I've seen lots of classes which generate the actual form inputs / selects
and what not, and I figured that best left to the designer.  That's what
they do.  I figured controlling the names and values of the fields
(including checked/selected), was all that was really required.  AND
possibly control the labels as well, but that's NOT mandatory and strictly
in case of error for added formatting (for the designer to control via cms
maybe?).
 
So um.. does doing it this way make sense?  I ask as my time is short in
general and I'd hate to put a few weeks into an idea that's been tried
thousands of times and failed.
 
Thanks!
 
Mark

What about if I change it to 666?
I need to be able to write the file to a target directory after I move it out of /var/tmp (where PHP keeps uploaded files temporarily)

I took the precaution of creating the target directory in a place NOT in public_html.  That way, a user couldn't attempt to access the file via URL.  I also check the file extension to make sure it ends in .bmp, .jpg, or .gif.  I was under the impression that in order to execute PHP, Perl code, the server has to recognize the extension.

preferable to use the curly brackets syntax, as it will also work
with 
object variables, etc.

I have come across this offer as well.  However, on step two of three I 
noticed a mention of potential account set-up fees, service fees and 
domain service fess.  Their text indicates that the details of these 
fees can be found on their site but I have not been able to find them.  
They have not returned my email asking about the location of the fee 
descriptions, which is a little curious as my previous requests for 
information were responded to quite promptly.  Thought that might be a 
little helpful for folks to here.  I'll post later if there are further 
developments.

 Hello all,

 This is an open invitation to join the 
 'Tea Party' at NYPHP.
 (you can find out more about the 'Tea Party' 
  by subscribing to the 'development' list at:
  http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/dev -- 
  this is a temporary measure -- in the future 
  all 'Tea Party' information will be available 
  through a 'Tea Party' account )
 
 Background info:
 ------------------
 We need to build some infrastructure to help
 organize development efforts at NYPHP.
 
 The plan is to build everything from
 existing php open source projects.
 (this is a 'learn by doing' project)
 
 We will be re-factoring php 4 code as
 php 5 classes.
 
 (This is good chance to 'dip your toes'
 into working with php 5.)
 
 Contact Hans at hans at nyphp.org if you
 want to participate.

 This project is not just for PHP-rocket-scientists 
 (although any 'rocket-scientist-types' are more 
 than welcome), if you can spell 'PHP' you are 
 invited to join.

 Some Misc. Info:
 -------------------
 There is a rudimentary beginning at: 
 http://paragon.nyphp.org/tea_party
 (click on 'System Requirements' )
 
 http://paragon.nyphp.org/tea_party/docs/html
 
 called "Tea Party Online Project Management"
 
 It is an amalgamation of the following:
 
 Netoffice at:
 http://netoffice.sourceforge.net
 
 phpCollab at:
 http://phpcollab.sourceforge.net
 
 phpmailer at:
 http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net
 
 JpGraph
 http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph
 
 
 and will have an interface to
 
 Mantis at:
 http://mantisbt.sourceforge.net
 
 and an interface to CVS
 and use mySQL as the database.

I signed up as well, and it has been just fine.  They don't require a credit
card, and using a pre-registered domain name is free.  Also, there is an
option the control panel to notify you (it may even be disable, I don't
remember) if the costs exceed an amount - I set mine to $1.00.  Not that I
have been charged (or asked to pay) for anything, just thought I would pass
that along.

Also has traffic monitoring, and the really nice thing that it comes with is
a newsletter system, which you can send out 1000 (opt-in) emails per month,
plus they give you a mechanism to do adds/removes from your list.

I don't have any complains so far.

Tom

I actually read through the FAQ and all of the contract before signing 
up and have been carefully watching it in the week or so since signing 
up. Yes, they have additional services they'll charge you for if you use 
them but they are clearly marked in the control panel and before you can 
use them I believe you need to submit a credit card which isn't asked 
for at all otherwise. Without using any of those extra services I was 
able to set up multiple domains I already owned for web serving and 
email. They give you 100 domains you can use for free, 50 email 
accounts, 500Mb of disk space, and 5Gb/month of bandwidth. To me those 
are pretty easy limits to stay inside. There was no set-up fee (waived 
according to the FAQ).. I'm not sure what you mean by service fee.. they 
do charge you a fee if you want to use them as your registar too secure 
a domain name but they give you one of their subdomains for free as part 
of the packagee and allow you to use any domains you already have for free.

PHP is slightly limited (running as CGI?) but includes a lot of built-in 
extra modules and unless you're doing something pretty unusual (I do) I 
don't think you'll notice.

Notice the promotion of theirs only lasts till Jan 21 2004. This tells
me they are not planning to give out millions of accounts for free just
a few. They do ask for a phone number that they expect to call but still
they opening themself up for some abuses.

Hi.

I'm a product manager at Macromedia, and I'm currently doing research among
PHP developers. I spoke to the list administrator and he suggested I post a
note to the group.

We are looking for people that DO NOT currently use Macromedia products for
writing PHP code but who would be willing to discuss their work on the
phone. Our goal is to better understand your needs so we can build products
that make your life easier.

If you would be interested, please follow the link below and provide contact
information. Your name will not be added to any of our marketing databases. 

If you meet the criteria we're looking for, someone will contact you for an
interview. The interview will take about 20 minutes and will be about how
you currently work, including team interactions, tools, likes/dislikes, etc.

No promises of free software (that is how we make money, after all), but if
you use DW now and have suggestions we're listening. It's the best way to

touche Tim... Macromedia's products are still, like 
Microsoft's, overpriced -- the last time I used UltraDev to 
develop an .asp website (don't ask), I couldn't believe all 
the crap that was thrown into their code just to do simple 
database r/w

I think the best way to appeal to serious programmers is to make something
more like this: http://www.ultraedit.com/

CF Studio was actually quite similar to UltraEdit several years ago. Is it
still around as a Macromedia product of some sort?

Boy are they going to get an earful if they call me. I stopped using 
flash because actionscript just plain didn't do what it was supposed to 
do, and customer support was rude & ignorant. They might of fixed it 
since MX, but I'd paid for several iterations already and would prefer 
them to make what I own work before I send more good money after bad.

They really seem to make their products worse with every iteration, not 
better.

I know Hans mentioned he uses UltraEdit... I used Soysal's 
PHPed before he sold it to NuSphere

And as far as Zend Studio is concerned, I use it not only 
because it's a great tool, but because I believe in 
supporting the fine folks at Zend

A developer -- let's called him yours truly -- has had a nagging problem
for a while. Client -- let's call her C -- has websites, hosted on a
shared server, that collect sensitive info. Said info is written to a
database for temporary storage -- up to a couple weeks, then wiped out via
a cron job whether C has gotten around to getting it or not. C logs onto
to an SSL-encrypted password-protected page to fetch info. Yours truly has
made every effort to make this system as secure as possible under the
circumstances -- e.g., running PHP in cgi mode and making all the
permissions as restrictive as possible, using SSL, etc.

However, yours truly thinks it would be better to use GPG or PGP for
encryption, but C cannot be persuaded to acquire, install and start using
PGP/GPG and thus keeps ~not~ providing yours truly with her public key
despite numerous requests.

Alternatively, yours truly thinks it might be more secure than the status
quo to go straight to an online payment gateway via SSL and process the
you-know-what in real time. C thinks this is unnecessary.

Your truly thinks it's time to prepare a written form for C to sign,
wherein she acknowledges having been advised of the risks and explicitly
states she wants to do it her way anyway.

What do you think?

Many TIA,

Could Ours Truly try volunteering to C to spend the time necessary to
set up GPG or PGP for her, end to end?  It's possible that C is
simply daunted by that task and if you take it off C's hands, she will
acquiesce.

greetings ...

a client is looking for a method to enable the ability where they could open
an excel doc, edit on the fly, and tie the content in with a website using a
template like say smarty ...

i have not read much up on "smart tags" but if content was tagged in smarty
like such:

{home_team.name} {home_team.score}

is there a dynamic way (macro, etc) to enable the content of the excel doc
to be posted to a site?  i had tried to convince the guy to ditch the excel
so i could do it online but he is someone more comfortable w/ excel only ...

what is the solution if i wanted to keep his doc and my site in sync?
thanks in advance for any suggestions.

I've thought of that but haven't proposed it -- for reasons that are
basically irrelevant here -- but it's an idea worth reconsidering. Thanks.
My expectation is that C will say no, not necessary -- but it might be
worth a try nonetheless.

For brevity's sake I omitted to mention before: C has another Geek who
minds her office computer stuff for her, and according to C, Geek has
declared that the status quo is OK because the page through which the
sensitive data is retrieved is SSL-encrypted.

David,

I know you are not going to want to here this answer, but I say do NOTHING,
and here's why:

You are a contractor (I'm assuming), you are paid to do what you are told.
What you are doing is not illegal, and you can provide documentation (I
assume you have sent her email about this) that you have informed her of the
risks.  I see no harm in asking her to sign something, but you are not
liable.

I am someone who is on the other end of this, meaning that I process orders
(over 100 a day) and frequently have to screen for fraudulent use of credit
cards that we take over our websites.  MANY times we have contacted local
authorities and Credit Card Companies with proof of fraudulent use (both in
the US and worldwide) of a particular card (used to purchase our products).
The sad reality is that no one actually cares.  Ultimately, it is the vendor
of the product who will have to eat the charge.  Why?  Because the Vendor
needs their merchant account to sell products, the customer will just get
another credit card if they feel they are treated unfairly.  The Credit Card
companies just pressures the vendor into eating the charge, or else they get
their rates raises, which can hurt business badly.  Because of this, we have
focused our efforts in developing checks to help insure that we don't charge
(and ship products for) a misused card.

So, in the eyes of the CC companies, they don't care if you are keeping
cards safe of people who have purchased your products.  What they really
care about is false charges on one of their cards.  The whole idea is turned
on its head.

I commend you for wanting to add security, and agree that it should be
there.  Personally, I think she doesn't want to upset her applecart by
learning something new, and probably doesn't want to pay you for the work
required to do this.  How we get around this is by offering these methods as
the only solution in the beginning, so the client start off immediately with
these features, and they accept "that's just how it is".

Good Luck,

Tom

You bring up some good points.

Suppose the card numbers and the personal information are stolen and
then used to make purchases with other vendors. What you saying the
other vendors are the once who really get screwed at this point ?

I'd like to. OTOH is it wise to get to detailed about your weaknesses on a
list that is publicly available and archived? Granted, this is paranoia in

Subject: [nycphp-talk] question about session and scalability
Message-ID: <AEF77A06-4171-11D8-B5B5-000A95BAE752@next-online.net>

All,
Here's a weird question for you all.

Got a client who wants to run a couple different web servers, each 
server running a copy of the same php application.  There will be some 
sort (TBD) of load balancer between the servers and the internet.  And 
there will be a separate server for the database.
Users need to log into the application, and stay logged in while using 
the application.  We want to be able to keep the users session open 
even if one of the web servers crashes.  The users will be conducting 
transactions (against PostgreSQL), so I can use the transaction login 
in the database.

My understanding is that if we're using $_sessions and the server goes 
down, then, the user looses their session (and any work they'd done).  
One of the ideas we've come up with is using a cookie, so we know from 
the inbound request who is making the request.  But I'm not keen on 
cookies, for various reasons.

We're anticipating no more than 50 concurrent users at any given time.  
I don't have an idea on how much load on a server a single user will 
be.

Any thoughts, suggestions?
thanks,
Chris Hubbard

Well Chris, on the face of it, that doesn't sound like an 
app that calls for load balancing at this point.  That, 
coupled with the [relatively] low odds of things crashing on 
users, it might be not be worth the effort.

So far as "losing work" it would seem that an app would be 
written in such a way to have relatively short commit 
cycles.  i.e. don't leave a transaction uncommitted that 
depends on a user "thinking things over at the keyboard"

Is there other compelling reasons why the client wants to 
run copies of the php app?

I agree with you, that the load *probably* does not warrant load 
balancing.  However, if it does, then would be nice/good/warm&fuzzy if 
it worked as a load balanced app.

thanks for the bit about short commit times, completely forgot about 
that.

There are several different implementation floating around for 
database-backed session handling.

If you were to use one of those then all your session data could be 
stored on the database server (or a separate session server) and it 
would make no difference which webserver a request went to.

The only problems the majority of these systems have are the added 
overhead of retrieving the data from the session database vs the local 
filesystem, and the fact that implementing locks is fairly difficult.

Just store your session data in a database. You can define your own
functions with session_set_save_handler().

If you're feeling adventurous, you can look into msession. As I
understand, it allows the servers to share sessions, so it is probably a
bit faster.

Better'n sliced bread eh?  I have my students load that up 
on their [typically Windows] home systems so they can do all 
the good stuff outside class.  And to uninstall, ya just 
delete the xampp folder!  In the classroom, we create a LAMP 
platform.

A couple things I have them do is to copy the 
ApacheMonitor.exe from \xampp\apache\bin up to where all the 
bat files are in C:\xampp for convenience.  Then they can 
control/restart apache by invoking the monitor, which ends 
up in the system tray -- good for experimenting with php.ini 
settings when you want to bounce the server.  And I remind 
the win2k/xp users to make sure apache is set to "Manual" 
startup mode in Services -- don't want a web server running 
behind your back!

Some of this is dealt with in the first chapter on strings. What I found 
when reading the book is that it has to be read carefully since there 
are cross-references to other sections of the book ("recipes") and 
additional references to the PHP site. There are other things you can do 
with heredocs...see page 12.

I use dreamweaver here at work do to my php development, and I like it. I used to use homesite all of the time, and I tried the demo of DWMX, and I saw everything that homesite had in it, plus the wysiwyg editor capabilities. The other good thing about the wysiwyg as apposed to frontpage is that it doesnt butcher your code when you switch to design view and edit stuff that way.

homesite comes on the dreamweaver mx cd, and has no license code, but I am sure it is a "use only if you bought dreamweaver mx"... but they should sell that as a separate product for people who dont want to pay the price of dreamweaver, but also want the coding functionality.

i only have 2 gripes with it though - the FTP has been really buggy as of late, having problems saving/connecting/etc, so I just do things on our local intranet server, and you cannot add code macros that I have figured out, like you can have commonly used code where you just type in the variable names, or the array name and key names, and it will create loops/etc that you use in a lot of different things. I dont have the time at work to get the developers toolkit and add a module for that, so Im sunk with that.

I think the best way to appeal to serious programmers is to make something
more like this: http://www.ultraedit.com/

CF Studio was actually quite similar to UltraEdit several years ago. Is it
still around as a Macromedia product of some sort?

If the client is really in love with the 'excel' product, 
maybe he could use the new version which can save to 'XML'.
Sorry, I don't have the details on the version of Microsoft 
Office which can save (as an option I believe) directly to xml.

It might be possible through the magic of 'LDAP' to create a 
remote directory which would be accessible by the web server.

The idea is that when the client saves the xml version of his 
spreadsheet on the remote system, your php stuff would include 
it (the excel/xml spreadsheet) automatically in the website.

It seems whenever I try something that looks like it should be 
fairly easy to do and it involves a Microsoft component ( in this 
case Microsoft's implementation of LDAP) there always seems to 
be a 'gotcha' lurking 'in the weeds'.

In this case the 'gotcha' might be that you have to have a 
Microsoft server to act the controlling 'authenticating server'.

Hope this serves as some food for thought.

Good Luck,

Little-known features of free web browsers...

If you need a decent free wysiwyg HTML editor, give Mozilla Composer a 
shot -- open Mozilla and click the third icon on the bottom left 
(between Mail and Address Book). It writes clean code. You can copy and 
paste formatted bits from other pages.

There's no integrated site manager, like Dreamweaver, but we all use 
SFTP or SCP anyway, right? :-)

Composer is pretty good, but the versions I've looked at have not had anything to make forms. Anyone know why?

The most recent versions of Excel (at least in Office XP and Office 2003)
allow you to publish the spreadsheet as a .htm file and autorepublish the
file every time the worksheet is saved.  You could then parse the file into
your PHP site, or just link to the HTML file directly (though it'd only look
as nice as the spreadsheet itself).

greetings ...

a client is looking for a method to enable the ability where they could open
an excel doc, edit on the fly, and tie the content in with a website using a
template like say smarty ...

i have not read much up on "smart tags" but if content was tagged in smarty
like such:

{home_team.name} {home_team.score}

is there a dynamic way (macro, etc) to enable the content of the excel doc
to be posted to a site?  i had tried to convince the guy to ditch the excel
so i could do it online but he is someone more comfortable w/ excel only ...

what is the solution if i wanted to keep his doc and my site in sync?
thanks in advance for any suggestions.

I ended up creating a pop3 mailbox for .cvs files + a cron job, so he saves
the files as .cvs and mails them to a dropbox account which works, but Excel
has a "Send To" which could also make it easier but I need to find a PHP/XLS
parser and came across this:

http://www.zakkis.ca/products/abc_excelparser/index.php

Which looks sweet but out of his budget ... then (thanks to the NYPHP list
archive) it seems like the topic was brought up before, I found ExcelRead_FR
which unfortunatley is all in French ... *but* calls new com() which defeats
the purpose since the box is running Linux.

So @ the moment its:

Client -> XLS -> CVS -> POP3 -> CRON-> PHP -> MYSQL

I think you mean .csv -- comma-separated value as opposed to concurrent
versioning system. It's an important distinction, because Excel knows nothing
about working with CVS.

As far as I know, CSV format is the universal solvent when it comes to database
/ spreadsheet / spss intercommunication.

If it turns out you do want to use that, I could translate. The page said something about a newer version and I think I saw that it uses Java. Does it require windows stuff?

There are a number of Unix solutions for PDF -> HTML translation ( and very few
that go the other direction, unfortunately ).

If nothing else, you could shell_exec() to something like pdftohtml:

I am thinking I might like to set this up for a friend but this would be
for semi-production, if you will. That is, he would be serving to the
world off his home machine but not to mass audiences, just for a personal
site. Question is, is there a how-to or something somewhere that lists the
security steps to be taken to make this reasonably safe, or I am insane to
dare think of it? He's running Win2K.

Interesting - my goal is to come up with a flexible method to edit PDF
templates, it may be possible to convert the PDF out of PDF format, change
the important areas, and convert it back to PDF with this:

http://www.rustyparts.com/pdf.php


I've done a bunch of stuff with this:

http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf

but now I need more flexibility in the PDF creation.

Not sure if I am going to go this route yet, but thanks for the tip!

David,
I've got a similar set up at home, but using XP instead.

If the box is connected directly to the internet, then it's going to 
get hit by a lot of stuff, trying to hack it.  My personal 
recommendation is to buy a small netgear router that supports NAT and 
port-forwarding.  these routers have a nice web interface where you can 
block all ports except for 80, and then set up port forwarding from the 
router (which will have the static ip) to the W2K box.  With this 
configuration the box is pretty tight.
You'll run into trouble with each port you open, mail, ftp, etc.  so 
it's best, if you can do it, to just have 80 open.

Search engines typically have filters that know how to read the PDF file
format. Once it's converted to regular text, they use their usual algorithms
to index it.

All of the commercial search engines (Verity, Autonomy, etc.) have filters
for PDF files as well as Excel, Word, powerpoint, and so on. Some of the
open source ones do as well, though I'm not really sure how good they are.
One I've heard good things about is Lucene, which is managed by the Apache
group. It's written in Java. I'm sure there are open source C-based ones as
well.

In Google's search results, they are able to search PDF files.  Anyone know

Jon, here are some clues:

Fichier = File
Feuille = Sheet
Cellule = Cell
Connexion = Connection
Classeur = Folder
Valeur = Value
Enregistrer = Save
Fermer = Close
OuvreLeFichier=OpenFile
EcritDansCellule=WriteInCell
NouvelleValeur = NewValue
RecupereValeurCellule=ReadCellValue
EcritDansCellule=WriteInCell

Hope this helps.

We are noticing ssl errors for IE browsers configured with

I have been on hold with Verign for about 1/2 hour so far, and testing some
big commercial shopping carts seems to show the same thing.

Can anyone else confirm this?

I suppose not. Bottom line:  if my account or if the root account on the
server were compromised, people could steal credit card numbers (although
not the names of the owners or expiration dates) from the mysql database
where they are stored, and that could be a Bad Thing, it seems to me;
whereas if the numbers were being PGP/GPG-encrypted at https request time,
the Bad Guys would have to be immensely powerful and talented to steal
this information

Thanks to all for the nourishing food for thought.

Forget about risk pools and actuarial studies.  The reason healthcare cost
so much for individuals is because the insurance company can really stick it
to you.  Group insurance - by definition - has more leverage cause it's a
bigger chunk of change for the providers to fight over.

I am in the [very] early stages of exploring group plans and wonder if there
are any other PHP'ers out there who, like me, feverishly type away in their
basement while wearing multiple hats?  Netting it out: is there anyone who
would be interested in forming a group so we can go shopping for health
insurance?  I'm really tired of writing such a large check each month.

couple notes ... if a home situation, is there a certainty 
of maintaining the same static IP address?  otherwise, it's 
a moving target

with asynchronous access protocols (like ADSL), keep in mind 
that the home network's upload speed is the download speed 
of the port 80 users -- which is just the opposite of what a 
web server calls for

NATing the external address without any other protections 
still gives outsiders pass-thru access to the internal 
address (usually the 192.168.0.0 variety)

as their website says, the default XAMPP install is 
inherently insecure, for good reason since it's meant to be 
wide-open for development purposes (e.g. MySQL has no

I am very interested,  I recall hearing recently that there is such a thing
already based out of New York (looking for the link), but I recall at the

Forget about risk pools and actuarial studies.  The reason healthcare cost
so much for individuals is because the insurance company can really stick it
to you.  Group insurance - by definition - has more leverage cause it's a
bigger chunk of change for the providers to fight over.

I am in the [very] early stages of exploring group plans and wonder if there
are any other PHP'ers out there who, like me, feverishly type away in their
basement while wearing multiple hats?  Netting it out: is there anyone who
would be interested in forming a group so we can go shopping for health
insurance?  I'm really tired of writing such a large check each month.

While not for groups...

There's the Healthy NY program for low income individuals who need 
affordable insurance.  See http://www.ins.state.ny.us/healthny.htm

Also, there's Child Helth Plus and Family Health Plus for those with very
low incomes.

After 1 1/2 hours, I finally got through to Verisign.  

They have two major issues.  The certificate revocation list servers are
down (their crl file is corrupt which may or may not be related, get it here
when it's good at http://www.verisign.com/repository/crl.html ) with no ETA
and their CA intermediate file has expired.  You can get a new
intermediate.crt from
https://www.verisign.com/support/site/caReplacement.html 

They have no plans to make the status of the crl servers known on their
website.  That's service for ya!

There are quite a few solutions to hosting a site on a dynamic IP ISP,
noip.com and dyndns.org among them.  You pay them a nominal fee to maintain
your DNS.  You download a client app that regularly reports in with your
current IP.
So, if your IP address changes, you're only unavailable for the length of
that time period in between updates (5 minutes, half an hour, depending on
the service's TOS).

I used to host a few websites on my dynamic IP DSL connection with
acceptable speed this way.  I had a router that only passed port 80 and 22
(so I could maintain the server from outside my network) on to the box.

interesting, seems that would be an acceptable workaround 
for a home server setup...  I'll file that one away

We've been pushing it over 3000 regularly recently and are currently testing
its upper limit.  Preliminary tests suggest a limit around 4090, but we suspect
it can be pushed higher.  This is running on RedHat 8.0, MySQL 4.0.14, RedHat's
BigMem kernel on a 4-way Xeon 2.5GHz, hyperthreading on and 12 GB of RAM.

Andrew

We have over 2048 constantly on a production machine (due to traffic), and
I have the max at 4096 (which we've come close to only during rare peaks).

Our hardware is less impressive than Andrew's - a 2-way P4, Red Hat 9, and
4 GB of RAM.

Also, for whatever reason, I can only get MySQL to reach this type of
performance using MySQL AB's pre-built binaries. I'm sure I'm just not
picking all of the right configuration options when I build it myself, but
I'd suggest using theirs unless you really know what you're doing (this
excludes me).

well ... it works pretty smoothly ... in fact I didn't really need that
class, just needed to refresh up on COM functions in PHP ...

http://us3.php.net/com

@ the bottom there is a nice Excel example ... so natively on Linux using
COM would probably have to be complex + deal with WINE i suppose, something
my ISP most likely wont allow me to install.

This is about what I expected to hear. As it stands now, my friend's box
is connected to the net with dynamic IP and no firewall, gateway/router,
or anything. If I can't get him to lay out a little cash for a router then
I guess the next best thing would be ZoneAlarm or the like, and explicitly
open only his http port. XAMMP thus installed, it seems, wouldn't make his
security any worse than it is now and possibly better (-:

His ISP probably blocks its customers' port 80 but you can circumvent that
by attaching Apache to some non-standard port and using a service like
dnydns.org which offers "web-hopping," i.e., forwards http requests to the
port you specify.

I recall reading that register_globals is on and mysql is passwordless,
That shouldn't be too hard to remedy (-:

After 1 1/2 hours, I finally got through to Verisign.  

They have two major issues.  The certificate revocation list servers are
down (their crl file is corrupt which may or may not be related, get it
here when it's good at http://www.verisign.com/repository/crl.html )
with no ETA and their CA intermediate file has expired.  You can get a
new intermediate.crt from
https://www.verisign.com/support/site/caReplacement.html 

They have no plans to make the status of the crl servers known on their
website.  That's service for ya!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] php ncurses based mysql process watcher.. (preview)
Message-ID: <1073605346.2767.40.camel@bezel>

I built a mysql process watcher in PHP using ncurses.
Screenshots here: http://soulreactor.com/mview/

I am interested in any ideas or things that can/could be added, i.e.
things you might find useful when monitoring your mysql servers, or
Algorithms used to compute meaningful data about the state of the server
etc.. 

No source released yet until I get the go ahead from work to opensource
it. My proposal is in, so hopefully not long.

Some points:
	- 100% dynamically resizeable depending on terminal size
	- entire project done in php
	- makes use of termgraph code I wrote for another app
	(termgraph code here:
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/index.php?view=textgraph )
	- graphs are updated default of once per second, this can be changed by
pressing number keys for different refresh rates.
	- This is also a follow-up to a tutorial I wrote for Zend
	(Zend tutorial on using ncurses with PHP: 
http://www.zend.com/zend/tut/tut-degan.php )

Cheers

I'd like to add a feature to a site for a user (a musician) to be able to
easily update a list of his upcoming gigs on one of the pages on his site.

He's pretty unsophisticated when it comes to computers.  Are there any open

I've done things like this a couple of ways. One was for a radio show producer who wanted a long list of radio stations and times for the show he produced updated on the site all the time. He kept the info in Excel. You can save Excel as an HTML fragment (no opening or closing), so I had him do that, upload it through a form, and used it as an include.

Alternately, you could just have a password protected form where he could edit a text file.

I would write a basic php script - one page for adding/deleting/editing the gigs, and one for displaying. the one for adding/deleting/editing is password protected.

if there is a mysql database, you would just have a timestamp for the date/time of the gig, a length of time field (if he wants), the name of the gig (if any) and where he is playing, and maybe a description field to say what hes playing or any notes he wants to share with the people, say setlists.

something like this would be very easy to write, if they have php and mysql on the server. im sure it would be easy if there is just php.

Is it considered good database design to have two tables related to 
each other through more than one field.

What I means is I have two tables. One is called "movies" and one is 
called "people".

Movies has some fields like "director, producer, cinematographer".  
People is just a list of people "first_name, last_name, etc."

Is it ok for movies to relate to people via "director" and "producer" 
and "cinematographer" or is it better to create a "producer" table to 
related to producer, "director" table to relate to director, etc.

I have a feeling I am doing it the right way just having a "people" 
table but I wasn't sure if this would cause any query problems down the 
line.

Thanks for your help. I am not sure if I used all of the proper 
terminology here so I can rephrase the question if needed.

how about:

a table of people
 - id, firstname, lastname, etc

a table of movies
 - id, title, etc

a table of roletypes
 - director, producer, actor, cinematographer, etc

and a table relating people to movies based on roles
 - movie_id, people_id, roletypeid

I agree, and I would like to mention that this can be deduced from the
first principal of normalization, if you look at it right.  Each of
those people is in some sense a "repeating" or "duplicative" column,
in that you could have arbitrarily many people listed, depending on
how many roles you wanted to track.

One purpose of the rules of normalization is that by following them
you can expand the information you track without altering your
database schema or tables.  If you wanted to add "screenwriter" or
"best boy" or "gaffer" or "sound editor" later, under the original
schema you'd have to alter the tables.  If you simply create a role
table and a mapping or association table that relates movies, people
and roles, as Greg Wilson proposed, then you can add new data later
without altering the schema.  

The other point about using id's comes straight from second normal
bform, and it helps make changes or corrections to data simple,
improves storage efficiency, and eliminates redundancy (in the bad
sense of redundancy).

I'd recommend learning about 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal forms and
thinking about them a bit.  If you intend to design a large database,
it may make sense to learn about 4th and 5th normal forms, and for
cases where denormalization also makes sense.  In this case, the
database is simple enough that after taking care to get to 2nd
normal forms (they are cumulative, so if you're in 2nd NF, you're also
in 1st) you have no further issues of concern, as far as I can tell.

Here's a pretty simple web reference I found in a quick search:

having that 3rd table does make sense, if the people are duplicated from the different movies. then you can link them all together, and not have to have duplicates.

roles are linked back to movies, and then the roles then connect to the person, and what they did, since they can change. I would have ended up having to create that 3rd table while developing it, since I would have caught it then. I am more of a develop it and modify it as im going along, rather than sitting down and developing the idea and it on paper firsthand. You never know when you are writing the form, or when testing it, if you really did need that other field, or another way to store data.

I cant say that I know everything, but one thing I do love about working with PHP, is that ever project you perfect your skills more and more, and always learn something. I love this list because I can read what other people would do in the same situation, and then it opens my mind up to see other peoples ways of doing things, and then assimilating the better ideas :P

I will go over the relational database docs, since I never really learned much on relational databases, since the only coding instruction that I have had did use flat files for data storage, which you just had to make sure your records(pascal)/classes would fit the data and point to the proper things nicely. Thanks for the tips you all!

With contribute, they have the ability to wysiwyg edit html pages, and you can set locked regions. The person would have to have working knowledge of web-page design to keep up these pages, or just working knowledge of putting together tables in word/excel. Our marketing department is looking at this for other departments to update their own stuff on our company website, since its all static documents on there :/

If he was looking for something searchable, a database w/ dynamic pages would be the best bet

i have a related question to the topic ...

when is it good to ever use a set/enum in MySQL?  I recently had the option
of doing a complete admin in phpmyadmin where I really did not want to
insert a new row using ID keys of 1,2,3,4 vs. "Forward","Defense","Goalie"
... I chose to create a table "position" but the queries really would have
been the same ...

is there ever an optimized reason to use a set/enum against another table?
(this is presuming the entire site is 'english' and not i18n-based) ... id
personally choose ease of editing if the database is small ...

I've used contribute.  Here's the gotcha's
First someone needs to use dreamweaver to create templates.  the 
templates need to have page edit blocks (forgot the macromedia term, I 
believe it's modify...templates...new edit block).  Its in the edit 
blocks that the artist can change his/her content without messing with 
the rest of the page.
Then those templates need to be uploaded to a Templates folder (by 
default) in the web site.
Then the artist can use Contribute to open and edit the files.

Alternatively, build a quick php app.  wouldn't be more than a couple 
hours.

This is great Greg. Thanks! Sometimes the person can fulfill different 
roles. (produce one film, direct the next). This works great for my DB.

Thanks to everyone for the comments.

I'm thinking more along the lines of your suggestion.  Yes I have MySQL and
PHP on the site.  I started to search of hotscripts.com but there are
hundreds of content manager programs listed on their site.  It really might
be faster to learn PHP and write it myself :-)

Did you look on 'SourceForge'?
That's the kind of thing they (should) have.
It seems you could find something you could

Bill,
You might take a look at PHPMaker
http://www.hkvstore.com/phpmaker/
it's inexpensive (around $20) and you can use it to build simple php 
applications.  It can be difficult to get the "look" just the way you 
want.  But for $20 it's not worth complaining.

Im really thinking of putting together the Smarty/POP3 publish hack I use
for some stuff ... basically you send an email to an address:

To: publish at site.com

<exml>
<foo>bar</foo>
<exml>

You can put the filename/etc as part of the tags or leave them static and
then in your Smarty template:

{$exml.foo}

The security portion of my stuff lies with STARTTLS for SPOP, but im sure
public keys + such could be thrown in.  Would this work?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL Licensing
Message-ID: <20040109213244.57191.qmail@web14310.mail.yahoo.com>

There is an interesting open license review for MySQL at:

http://zak.greant.com/archives/000203.html

This was sparked by recent blog discussions about MySQL's licensing. There
is obviously at the very least some confusion surrounding MySQL's
licensing, and there are even potentially flaws in it.

For example, George Schlossnagle brought up a very good point that he can
write an application that uses Oracle as backend storage without paying
Oracle any money. Those who buy this software and need to implement it
will need to have Oracle, and it is they who must pay the licensing fee.
MySQL's license appears to extend to such applications, and no one from
MySQL AB refuted this.

I bring this up here, because Zak is going to be at LinuxWorld and plans
to host discussions on this issue there. It seems like NYPHP will be a
group with a lot of representation at this event, and most of us are
likely interested in either:

1. Understanding MySQL's licensing better
2. Trying to affect positive change in MySQL's licensing

I'm potentially interested in both.

Chris

Message-ID: <3FFFC21D.3050500@ryoshu.com>

I have an extranet to build and after some wrangling, PHP is the choice 
(vs. ASP.Net and JSP).  I'm not looking at heavy traffic so should I go 
with PHP 5 (is it usable yet), or should I do PHP 4?

Well, it's the beginning of a new year and that 
tends to bring out 'Silvia (the psychic) Brown'-esque 
predictions by self-appointed pundits on what will 
happen during a coming (new) year.

Let me join in the fray and say, after polishing up my 
crystal ball, that I see PHP 5 stabilizing around June 
of this year.

If you don't mind (and if your environment permits) periodic 
upgrades and patches, go with PHP 5.

The (version 4) features of PHP 5 seem to be alive and 
unbroken in the (b3) release which I am testing on Windows XP.
(and so as a direct answer to your question -- yes 
PHP is usable now -- my opinion of course).

The determining factor may be whether you want to develop 
'commercial' products and which of the available data storage 
applications you want to use (How lite do you take your SQL?).

As a footnote, I found a page which may be of interest to you.
(especially if you agree that data storage apps. could be the 
'swing factor' in your decision) 

There is a published 'Data Speed Comparison' test report at:
http://sambar.polie.nl/sqllite.htm

Hope this helps

hi,

was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction, im setting up
a roller hockey league site and interested in creating "player cards" with
different frames over the card to allow players to print them out online ...

what im mainly interested in is using the gd library so i could layer images
dynamically - is transparency possible?  any links i could follow?  thanks.

card style -> frame -> photo -> stats -> logo

Of course, give yourself half a chance to succeed and dump gif in favor 
of png.

Amen, brother.

All the browsers do PNG with indexed transparency.
Some (Gecko-based) even do PNG with an alpha channel, a truly beautiful 
thing.

The only reason GIF isn't dead is animation.

I was under the impression that PNG was not supported by all the major
browsers. This is very good news!

Can anyone provide some details on the stats of PNG as a format? (the
alpha channel support is wild)

Hi,
I have written a lot of functions to handle transparent images.

Here is a link to one of the main projects I used it for, doing a
karumba clone for my evilwm system.
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/index.php?view=phpalphawall

Here is a link to the code-snippets archive for.
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/index.php?view=SNIP&cat=42
alpha-blended images (think transparency).. etc..

Check them out and let me know if you have any questions.

Microsoft to abandon standalone IE
May 31, 2003
http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-1011859.html?tag=fd_top

which is one day after

Microsoft to pay AOL $750M 
 
Tech titans settle Netscape lawsuit, 
set seven-year licensing pact for 
AOL to use Internet Explorer.
May 30, 2003
 
http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/29/technology/microsoft/

So it would seem AOL will be using I.E. -- but Microsoft 
will not (at least not in its present form i.e. standalone 
browser)

There is different ways to create tree stuctures in relational model.
The extra data you may want to add depends on how your search queries
will be done.  You will be better served by using existing solutions you may find on the web.

If you're that worried about png support, output the image as a JPEG 
(or even as a link to a downloadable tiff, if lossy compression itches 
you the wrong way), assuming you only need transparency in the various 
layers that comprise the image and not the final "card" itself. Many 
installs have the ability to read gifs, but not output them, and some 
just don't bother with them whatsoever, so the odds are you can 
probably use gifs for the components. On the other hand, you could just 
as easily use png, since the output file format doesn't have to match 
the input format, so it really doesn't matter what the browser can and 
can't accept. I'd even go so far as to suggest for better performance, 
save all the styles, frames and other commonly used images in the 
intermediate gd2 native format and save yourself a little processing 
time in the conversion process.

Take a look at the nested set model.  See the archives of the Dev list =
at http://nyphp.org/lists for many links and discussion.  There's also a =
working implementation in pure PHP/MySQL:

http://paragon.nyphp.org/clew/pnsm.pcom

It's abstracted from the actual data you want to store, so it should =
work with anything.

well ... it works pretty smoothly ... in fact I didn't really need that
class, just needed to refresh up on COM functions in PHP ...

http://us3.php.net/com

@ the bottom there is a nice Excel example ... so natively on Linux using
COM would probably have to be complex + deal with WINE i suppose, something
my ISP most likely wont allow me to install.

Hi Hans,
Yea, that is me, just moved here to Manhattan from New Orleans (prior
from the west coast). Found this list and am pretty excited about it as
a php group in nola consists of a few guys sitting at a bar chatting
about what can be done in the language.

Anyway, if any of you are going to the Linux Expo at the Javitz center
(Jan 21st-23rd) you will be able to find me there.

Mview will be released from one of my servers located in our New Orleans
data center as per the restrictions for source control (it is part of
the deal in being able to opensource a project from my work). It is
already a tool that I always keep running here and most people at my
work are running throughout the day to see the realtime graphs of the
mysql servers.

I am looking at a two week or so timeframe to be able to opensource the
project. 

I am currently working on a version that uses lines for the graphs
instead of ascii. And hopefully can get a color-spread in so that it
varies from blue to red etc.. 

It looks cool and serves a purpose.

Cheers
-Joel De Gan

Message-ID: <007f01c3d8a0$a6fb2630$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

greetings ...

thank you for all the great suggestions for my other problems, i currently
have a small math problem that maybe someone could help me out with ...

basically for the hockey league i created a rating system where each player
can rate another player on their team (from 1 to 10) and submit it ... then
in turn it will calculate a rating on their hockey card from 70 (lowest) to
100 (hightest) ...

what i do is combine the average rating from all the players votes received
(x + y / total) and add the points per game (goals + assists / games) ...

i did a very small test below but not being familiar with php math functions
im sure there is something i can do to get a range/median value:

$peer_average = $_GET['peer'];
$goals = $_GET['goals'];
$assists = $_GET['assists'];
$games = $_GET['games'];

$ppg = (($goals+$assists) / $games) * $peer_average;

$rating = round(($ppg) + 70);

// ugly i know
if ($rating < 70) $rating = 70;
if ($rating > 100) $rating = 100;

echo "rating: " . $rating;

I just set up PHP on Linux with Apache, can someone tell me how to turn the
warnings and notices OFF. I do it on windows server by editing the PHP.ini
file but I can't find the PHP.ini file on Linux.

ahh, you'd be better off with:

find /etc -name php.ini

and if that fails:

find / -name php.ini

If you want to know where php is 
reading its ini file from.

If you can upload a file like this:

test.php
contents:

<?php
phpinfo(INFO_GENERAL);
?>


If you execute that script 
it should give you some information 
like the following:

Configuration File (php.ini) Path -- "/whereitsat/php.ini"

another way that's pretty convenient is to use the
"locate filename" that searches a database that is updated 
by a default cron job (at least on redhat systems)... it is 
very quick.

the only caveat is to keep in mind that, since the cron job 
runs once per day, files that are added or deleted will not 
be reflected until the cron job runs -- of course, you can 
manually run "updatedb" (it takes little time to run). But 
in most instances, things will be pretty much up to date.

greetings ...

i am wondering if this is a client/server incompatibility issue or not,
maybe someone has had the same issue ... when connected to mysql cli and
performing an update or delete on a table i seem to always get "0 rows
affected" in which the case is not true (confirmed by a followed select) ...

it also seems to be problematic with the mysql_affected_rows() function.

is there something else i should check?

That does sound very odd, though you would have to provide more details 
to be able to properly diagnose the problem.

I do know that affected rows will return the number of rows actually 
changes by an update, so if you set a value to the value it currently 
has it will not be counted.

As for a DELETE, it will return 0 affected rows if you do not specify a 
WHERE clause.  This is due to an internal speed optimisation, if you 
don't specify a where clause (in autocommit mode) it actually performs a 
TRUNCATE on the table.

I don't know if this helps you much, but they are the only cases I can 
think of where you should get an affected_rows value of 0.  If your 
queries do not fall into one of these categories then there is 
definitely something fishy going on.

I've always felt PHP needed an integrated toolkit like OpenACS at 
http://www.openacs.org  or Zope.
The closest I've seen is the CMS's like PHPNuke and they don't seem to 
have the breadth of these other systems.
I saw somewhere that Chris Shiflett was organizing a PHP community site 
and I think that is an opportunity to create a unified system which 
later projects could
install and use. It saves developers time  initially and if ever new 
functionality is to be added.
Install the core. Add the forums module.(maybe a variant of CLEW) Add 
the news and polls modules. etc.

I doubt there is anything a good open source php progect that can be
compared to Zope. PHPNuke is a content magement software its by no means
a toolkit or framework of reusalbe components and by no means comes
close to being compared to something like Zope. 

There is plenty of php frameworks that are aimed to help speed the
process of creating applications. Take a look at this page
to get you started
http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/link/category/34/

There is also just class libraries that are there to help you spead up
creating coding like PEAR. 

I could even say that PHP itself id designed for rapid development of
web applications.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Setting up of a PHP Application Framework Index
Message-ID: <1073962590.14447.24.camel@human>

Hi all,

I have been thinking about setting up a website to index and collate all
the available PHP Application Frameworks. I am hoping to leave out the
more CMS directed frameworks and solely focus on frameworks for generic
php application development such as logicreate , seagull,mojavi ,
phpShop etc.

I hope to also collate reviews and feedback from the community on these
framework and also put them up on the site. 

This information and feedback will then be aggregated into some sort of
index that I hope will allow PHP users to quickly determine whether a
framework is suitable for them. Aspects of frameworks that might be
listed in the index would probably be , the type of services it provides
(i.e. templates, DB abstraction, caching, security etc), the quality of
its documentation, community support etc. Initially this Index will just
be a massive HTML table with all the relevant details in , however as
the lists gets larger I probably want to make it an index that can be
searched. 

I would be eternally grateful if you could help me answer a few of the
questions below:

1.What do you think about the idea? Is it repeating stuff people have
already done ? Is it woth the time ? Would it be useful to the
community?

2.What would constitute a PHP Application Framework ? How do we discern
between th hosts of Nuke derivatives that allow for module development
but are not really suitable for more generic application development ?

3. What aspects of Application Frameworks do you think we would need to
highlight in the index?


Thanks for your time mates.

Might I suggest adding 2>/dev/null to that so your screen doesn't fill up
with "permission denied"

Anyway, the good news is, it ain't hard to figure out where your php.ini

Hello,

My client has a Win2000 server with IIS 5 installed. The sysadmin is saying to
me that for IIS *not* to serve dot inc files (like lib.inc), you can't simply
use the suffix of the file (as with Apache) and exclude all dot inc files based
on their suffix. What you have to do is to put all your dot inc files in a
repertory, and then tell IIS that the repertory contains files that are
executable but not to be seen in the browser.

I'm not a Windows guy (although I have IIS 5/Win2000 on a test machine), but I
find it hard that IIS 5 can't discriminate files to be seen by the browser based
on their suffix. Is it true?

TIA

Cheers

I think I figured it out, if I can understand what you want done..

1) Need PHP to include a file from a directory. in my example, it is http://localhost/testing/index.php
2) The include directory needs to have scripts able to read it, but must deny browsing to those pages. - http://localhost/testing/include/lib.inc

What I did:

1) Go into IIS management, and select the directory that you want to change the persmissions on, and in my example, it is /testing/include/
2) Right click on the folder, and select properties.
3) Uncheck read access. There should be nothing in the checkboxes.
4) Test!

You disabled read access from IIS to access those files, so when you type in http://localhost/testing/include/lib.inc - it will give you a HTTP 403.2 - Forbidden: Read Access Forbidden error. The reason why PHP can read the files, is that the system has NTFS permissions to read the file. When php opens a file to read, unless it opens it via a http:// command, it will read it locally, which IIS has no control over.

Hope that helps!

Keith Richardson

Hello Keith, thanks for the reply.

If I understand you, your suggestion doesn't help to resolve my problem because
the access control is based on a repertory when I want this access control based
on the suffix of the file.

Your solution will not work if I have a repertory with this content:
http://localhost/testing/index.php
http://localhost/testing/index.inc

With Apache, it?s easy to tell the server not to serve files that ends with
".inc". I'm trying to figure out if this is possible with IIS 5.

Cheers

While I don't know the answer, I feel like the only one who understands
the question. :-)

He just wants to know if IIS can be configured to deny requests for URLs
that end in .inc. A Windows guy told him that it can't do this, and he
finds that hard to believe.

I say if the client is using Windows, direct access to .inc files is the
least of their worries. :-)

I have a hard time finding it - I can see where you can have different files go to different drivers, say .php goes to php4isapi.dll - but I cant find where you can deny extentions. If someone puts up a word document, then they can download it, or any other wierd extension.

If it were me, If I wanted protected files, I would do what I explained, or deny read access on a file by file basis if you dont want a whole directory, or find some wierd hack for IIS (If there is any)

OR just install apache win32. :)

Hi Emmanuel,

I do not use IIS myself, so I am not sure if there is a mechanism to 
perform the function you need, though I haven't been able to find 
anything in the documentation.

One solution which may solve the problem is to associate the .inc 
extension with php, and then include the following code at the top of 
your .inc files:

if ( $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] == __FILE__ )
{
	exit;
}

You can gain similar functionality by defining a constant in your 
index.php with:

define ('MY_CONSTANT', 1);

and then in index.inc:

if ( !defined ('MY_CONSTANT') )
{
	exit;
}

Other than that, my advice is to use a real webserver.

It's a tool called URLScan, which is part of the IIS Lockdown Tool.  The
newsgroup article is a description by a Microsoft employee of how to
configure URLScan to exclude based on file extension.

Hello Keith, thanks for the reply.

If I understand you, your suggestion doesn't help to resolve my problem
because
the access control is based on a repertory when I want this access control
based
on the suffix of the file.

Your solution will not work if I have a repertory with this content:
http://localhost/testing/index.php
http://localhost/testing/index.inc

With Apache, it's easy to tell the server not to serve files that ends with
".inc". I'm trying to figure out if this is possible with IIS 5.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

Hey thanks Tom for the answer, its exactly what I was looking for.

Thanks also to the others that replied. And sorry for not establishing clearly
my question.

Re Win2000 and IIS. These are not my choices. I'm always pushing for an
Apache/FreeBSD/Debian/OS X solution. I rather develop on a *nix environment.

Also, I'm using a framework where the important dot inc files are not in a
public repertory. But I had some .inc files in the public repertory. These
contains mainly html  to be included in the .php files.

I'm having what might be called a long-running "feud" with a client. 
Their computer tech claims the problem is in my code...I claim the 
problem is in their mail server. Here's the scenario.

A PHP form sends out two emails upon completion: one to the client and a 
confirmation copy to the person who filled out the form. If I use my own 
email address in place of my client's address, I always receive the 
emails that come from the form. If I substitute my client's address as 
the recipient, the client never receives the email.

I suspect that the problem lies in the configuration of the client's 
mail server, namely MS Exchange Server, that has a number of things shut 
down (or perhaps, filtered is the right term) so that spammers don't use 
their mail server. (Yes, this happened to them...some spammer figured 
out that they could use their mail server to send out a zillion emails.)

Below is a copy of the message headers. What I think is happening is 
that whatever they've configured in Exchange Server prevents a message 
with these headers from getting through.

Any help with this is greatly appreciated.

Actually...it wasn't for "display purposes" whereas "mydomain.com" was, 
indeed, for display purposes.

The more I look into this the more I realize that the problem is in the 
headers. Whereas my ISP seems to let most anything slip through...my 
client's mail server does not. At least that's the conclusion I've come 
to at this late hour. ;)

Message-ID: <200401140456.i0E4uaOf017421@nycsmtp3out.rdc-nyc.rr.com>

Brand new to PHP.  Got a couple of questions. 
 
The following code runs on my local machine but not on my host.  On the host
I'm not sure what value to use for the $site variable.  Using the website or
IP address isn't working.  
 
>>
    // connect to the RDBMS
    $db = mysql_connect("$site","$user","$pass") 
        or die_now("<h2>Could not connect to database server</h2><p>Check
passwords and sockets</p>$site,$user,$pass");
 
    // select the database
    mysql_select_db("$database",$db) 
        or die_now("<h2>Could not select database $database</h2><p>Check
database name</p>");
<<
 
 
Also, why does one select the database after logging in with the user/pw?
Does a username span all of my databases or are users under a given
database?  And also, on a typical web host that serves many accounts, am I
sharing a database with other host accounts or do I have my very own MySQL
instance?
 
And lastly, is there a way to connect to MySQL on my host using a client
side tool like MySQL Turbo Manager?  Is the account I'd use the same
account/pw I'd use to FTP files or is it one of the MYSQL usernames?
 
Much thanks

Say no more! :)  To prove to them that their mail server is the problem, 
have the script send out three emails.  One to them, one to the client and 
then the third to some neutral email account that someone on their staff 
controls (Yahoo, Hotmail, other ISP).  This way, they can verify that the 
emails are indeed being sent.

Of course, IF they really knew what they were doing, they would have 
already looked at the mail server's logs and been able to see that your 
mails are getting to their server and are being rejected -- and tell you 
WHY they are being rejected -- and then fix the problem on their end.

But, then they'd have to point the finger at themselves... and do some 
work...

Oh well,

Check $php_errormsg when doing mysql_connect() has problems.

Also, chances are $site needs to be 'localhost' rather than the domain 
name.

Also, does the MySQL installation there have all the permissions lined up 
for the host, user, password, database combination.

All of this information should be given to you by your ISP -- or you can 
figure it out if you have access to the 'mysql' database which contains 
all of the priveleges information.

I'm guessing you need to read up on the privileges system:

Thanks Dan.  You nailed it.  I changed the db to localhost and it's working.
THANKS!!
 
Info from my isp?  Not likely but that's what you get for $3.95 a month.

Message-ID: <20040114050240.19693.qmail@mail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to compare the type of file I uploaded with certain MIME types as part of a series of checks.

In one case, $imageType was equal to "image/jpeg" but it still fell into my error area.
Why?  I thought at first it was "short-circuiting" on the if statement, but that would apply to && conditions, right?


Thanks.


Code snippet
------------


		if ($_FILES["frontimage"]["name"] != "")
		{
			$imageType = $_FILES["frontimage"]["type"];
		
			// Check MIME Type
			if ((strtolower($imageType) != "image/png") || (strtolower($imageType) != "image/jpeg") || (strtolower($imageType) != "image/gif")) 
			{
		       	$errorMessage["frontimage"] = "Please upload images with the extension .jpg or .jpeg or .gif or .png only.";
				$errors = 1;
				echo($imageType);
				exit();
	   		}
                 }

While I no I set myself up to get stung in the rear, it's got to be 
their mail system.
Or does Microsoft want programmers to have to  start including platform 
specific code?
If an email was sent.........it was sent.
If one server can receive it and another can't........
Well, so its not that simple , but it probably is.

By one case, do you mean one particular file always does this , or it 
happened once and not again?

Here at work we use a MS Exchange 2000 server, which was installed recently. The one thing that they disabled was SMTP access unless you were logged into the domain, and they had to disable that to allow PHP to send emails. I am sure that we can make it "log on" to the mail server, but right now we decided not to.

Here is my php.ini settings:
SMTP is set to 172.17.1.13 (Internal Email server IP Address, not addressable from the internet)
sendmail_from is set to php at thompsonhealth.org (an alias that I created for my account)
sendmail_path is blank.

I can create an email message with those settings just by doing:
mail("keith.richardson at thompsonhealth.org","this is a test subject","This is a test message");

and it will send an email to myself.

maybe it is a problem with your email address not being on the exchange server, so it denys email messages sending through it from you? I would believe that this is some setting in exchange that is blocking you.

I'm having what might be called a long-running "feud" with a client. 
Their computer tech claims the problem is in my code...I claim the 
problem is in their mail server. Here's the scenario.

A PHP form sends out two emails upon completion: one to the client and a 
confirmation copy to the person who filled out the form. If I use my own 
email address in place of my client's address, I always receive the 
emails that come from the form. If I substitute my client's address as 
the recipient, the client never receives the email.

I suspect that the problem lies in the configuration of the client's 
mail server, namely MS Exchange Server, that has a number of things shut 
down (or perhaps, filtered is the right term) so that spammers don't use 
their mail server. (Yes, this happened to them...some spammer figured 
out that they could use their mail server to send out a zillion emails.)

Below is a copy of the message headers. What I think is happening is 
that whatever they've configured in Exchange Server prevents a message 
with these headers from getting through.

Any help with this is greatly appreciated.

If you need to run a mysql connection from a different machine than the localhost, you can add the ips and/or hostnames to the usernames to connect to mysql. You can say that user test/test can only connect from localhost, or from any host, or from your host, and then give them permissions that way. I have noticed that if you give access to some hosts, it maybe will say its connecting from another server, say the IP, the hostname, the hostname with a subdomain off of it, so to find out why you arent connecting, when you die() after the connect, use  die(mysql_error()) - and it will display the proper error. I tried to connect from our intranet server to my win2k desktop that is running mysql, and mysql_error() puts out Access denied for user: 'root at 172.17.1.11' (Using password: YES) - so you know that you have to allow that user access from the host 172.17.1.11 - now if it was a machine with a FQDN, the domain name would probabally show up there.

Using the type thats in $_FILES is generally a bad idea, since its set 
by the browser, and different browsers set different types for the same 
file. I usually use the *nix program file program to determine the 
filetype, then you know that it will always return the same typ for the 
same type of files.

Something like
file -ib <filename>
gives the type on the last line.

Just my idea. :)

There are definite issues with using the provided mime type as it is 
provided by the browser.  Realistically however you can probably get 
away with it for most situations.

Once the script is running it may be an idea to put in some code to use 
mime_content_type or file -ib to get a more accurate mime type.

There is indeed an error in the construction of your if statement.  Your 
test will NEVER return FALSE.

A better routine would be:

if ($_FILES['frontimage']['name'] != '')
{
	$imageType = $_FILES['frontimage']['type'];

	// Check MIME Type
	if ( 
!in_array(strtolower($imageType),array('image/png','image/jpeg','image/gif')) 
)
	{
        	$errorMessage['frontimage'] = 'Please upload images with the 
extension .jpg or .jpeg or .gif or .png only.';
	$errors = 1;
	echo($imageType);
	exit();
	}
}

The critical line is:

!in_array(strtolower($imageType),array('image/png','image/jpeg','image/gif'))

Conceptually this makes a lot of sense, if the imagetype is not in the 
array of 'good' types, throw an error.

The code will also be a lot faster because it eliminates several calls 
to strtolower, and all the double-quotes are replaced with single-quotes.

Granted, it can be bad, but I've seen some pretty bad quoting on other
lists :)

you're are replying.

Certainly valid... good quoting and email forming is critical.  And, as
clew takes shape and moves in to replace this system, messages *must* be
well formed.

We've been needing to get some posting guidelines and do's/don't's for
the NYPHP lists.  If anyone has any written up, I'll be happy to add
them to nyphp.org

Are you affecting all rows in the table?  Is a WHERE clause specified?
Otherwise, maybe the cli and server versions are incompatible...

We went through this exercise...actually...a somewhat modified version. 
Whoever fills out the form always gets their confirmation. I then 
configured it to send it to client's home email account...and that works 
too. I haven't tried the Yahoo/Hotmail idea...perhaps that's the one 
that will finally convince them of the source of the problem.

I wonder if the issue is that the mail is hosted in one place and the 
mail in another. Normally this isn't an issue if things are configured 
correctly but if it's not configured correctly.....

I keep talking to the client's tech to find out if there is some sort of 
"white list" perhaps, that would let these emails in. Of course...I just 
get the telephone equivalent of a blank stare (i.e., silence on the phone).

Some other lists send out a monthly "rules reminder" that addresses, not 
only etiquette, but also subscribing/unsubscribing to the list. Might be 
something we'd want to consider.

Sorry, that was poor diction on my part.

I meant to say "for example."  I used a file whose extension was clearly .jpg
I used pathinfo() to make sure it was, yet my if statement seems to be coming out false, resulting in my error message being used.  It should not be that way.

Eric,
I'm not well-versed in UNIX.  How do I invoke a command-line program in PHP?  Is there something like a system() call in some other languages?

Using the type thats in $_FILES is generally a bad idea, since its
set 
by the browser, and different browsers set different types for the
same 
file. I usually use the *nix program file program to determine the 
filetype, then you know that it will always return the same typ for
the 
same type of files.

Something like
file -ib <filename>
gives the type on the last line.

Just my idea. :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHundamentals: virtual host addendum?
Message-ID: <BC2AD7EA.15C5F%stephen@musgrave.org>


yes, this is a great idea.  thanks to all who contribute to these articles.
in the rush to get the know the language, these finer details are all too
often glazed over.

[guilty.]

i develop on MAC OS X and thought i would offer some additional pointers on
the VIRTUAL HOSTING topic that may be added to the topic by whomever
maintains it.

http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_virtualhosting.php?expiredate=10/10/2003

i would appreciate a peer review on this since i am not totally confident
that my installation is typical (especially with regard to the location of
the Sites directory).  there might also be some tips to improve the language
so as to be more helpful.

to set up a virtual host on MAC OS X

1.  Setting up the directories for the virtual host

1a.  Create a directory within your 'Sites' directory that will hold all the
files for your project.  I typically append .dev to the domain name.  So if
I were working on a project for project.com, i would name the directory
'project.dev'.

1b.  Within the project.dev directory, create your document root directory
(htdocs, www or public_html).

2.  Setting up a machine alias in Net Info Manager

2a.  Open Net Info Manager (located in Applications/Utilities).

2b.  In the middle column, select the 'machines' directory (/machines) and
then select 'localhost'.  Click on the 'duplicate' icon on the task bar.
(Be sure that the you have unlocked the application before trying to
duplicate or else the icon will be dim and you won't be able to duplicate.)

2c.  Select the 'localhost copy' machine.  The details (ip_address, name,
servers) will show up in the panel below the list.  double click on the
value for name (localhost copy).  Rename it to 'project.dev' or whatever you
would like.  This is the string you will enter for the URL in your browser
to reach the virtual host.  Close Net Info Manager

3.  Edit the Apache httpd.conf file (/etc/httpd/httpd.conf).

3a.  Using vi (or other editor), edit the httpd.conf file.  It is likely you
will have to use the sudo command:  sudo vi httpd.conf  (Make a backup
first! -- sudo cp httpd.conf httpd.conf.bak)

3b.  Scroll until you see:
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
 DocumentRoot /Users/username/Sites
 ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>

3c.  Copy and paste this virtual host definition for localhost.  Change the
values to look like so:
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
 DocumentRoot /Users/username/Sites/project.dev/htdocs
 ServerName project.dev
 ErrorLog /Users/stephenm/Sites/project.dev/error_log
</VirtualHost>

4d.  Save the file.

5.  Restart Apache

5a.  Open 'System Preferences'.
5b.  Click on 'Sharing'.
5c.  Under the 'Services' tab, click 'Personal Web Sharing'.
5d.  Click on the 'Stop' button.  When it shows as 'Start', click it again.
When it shows as 'Stop' you know that the server has restarted normally and
there weren't any compilation errors entered in the httpd.conf file.
5e.  Alternately, you can use the command 'apachectl graceful'.

6.  Testing

6a.  Create an 'index.html' file the document root fold of the virtual host
(Sites/project.dev/htdocs)
6b.  Enter 'http://project.dev' into the location of your browser.
6c.  You should see file you just created.

Even better, use the mime-magic extension:

This is the best list that I know of:

http://webdesign-l.com/policies/

I may be able to get permission to "share" them (or that parts that
apply to us) with NYPHP if we decide we like them.

Dan,
Thanks for those tips as well.  Since you are the secon person to mention file -ib, I'll have to look into that as well as mime_content_type.

> In one case, $imageType was equal to "image/jpeg" but
it still fell into my error area.

the if statement, but that would apply to && conditions, right?

>>>There is indeed an error in the construction of your if statement.

Oh shoot, I think I see why now... if $imageType was "image/jpeg," the other two conditions would always be true, and the || would always be true.  Doh!

$_FILES["frontimage"]["type"];

I have violated programming 101. *bangs head at wall...metaphorically*

I have to see if my host compiled its PHP processor with this option turned on.

I'm trying to write small programs without a lot of extensions (i.e. PEAR), because some hosts don't install them.

If someone wants to "take the lead" on reviewing the technical details 
(I have zero experience with the Mac setup), we could then add an 
"addendum."

Now that's good policy!  If you could Adam that'd be great...let me
know.  We can compile the pertinent information into our own policy and
I see no reason to credit them as a source, and anyone else who

yes i think its incompatability because when running local w/ 4.0.17-max the
affected rows will row when using the same client and then when connecting
to 3.23 on the server i get 0 rows reported ... it was just wierd to have
php report the same.

Are you affecting all rows in the table?  Is a WHERE clause specified?
Otherwise, maybe the cli and server versions are incompatible...

Jeff,

An addendum for Mac user is a great idea, however there are also a few 
things which could be improved in the current howto.

Maybe time for 'Virtual Hosting Setup 2.0 - Windows 98/XP & Linux with 
Apache'?

Specifically some links to appropriate Apache documentation might be an 
idea, also some of those rules could be rewritten to be more friendly to 
IP address changes.

I am sure that the setup for Mac OS X is the same as *Nix - since I have added hosts on my Mac OS X machine using the /etc/hosts, which is the same place as my linux box on the net.. so the only difference is where you want to stick the hosts files in.

Jeff,

An addendum for Mac user is a great idea, however there are also a few 
things which could be improved in the current howto.

Maybe time for 'Virtual Hosting Setup 2.0 - Windows 98/XP & Linux with 
Apache'?

Specifically some links to appropriate Apache documentation might be an 
idea, also some of those rules could be rewritten to be more friendly to 
IP address changes.

I'll throw together a quick beta version of the steps so people can

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL usage up 30%
Message-ID: <000d01c3dae0$a321b2d0$bf8d3818@oberon1>

"MySQL usage has increased by more than 30% in the last year"

It is interesting to note -- but the article doesn't give any 
detail (I guess they want you to buy the report).

The article doesn't say how big the sample was for the survey 
was -- did it go from 100 to 133 installations or from 100,000 to
133,000.

Still, 30% is 30%.

Yes, sure is, I attached my function below:

function file_type($src){
	$exec = '/usr/bin/file -ib '.$src;
	exec($exec, $return);
	if( is_array($return) && isset($return[0]) ){
		return trim($return[0]);
	}else{
		return false;
	}
}

make sure to change the path to your file program, but I think this is a 
somewhat standard place.

see the difference between system() and exec() and you'll see why I'm 
using exec().

I've built a cobntest registration system for a client.  Now we need a

general idea of randomly number generating in PHP, but I was wondering if
any of you have any insight into makiong a truly random user picker ,or if
just using an ORDER BY RAND() will do just fine.

I'm sorry, but does anybody have an example on how I would call this function from PHP?
I saw a system() command, but its return is a string containing the output of that command, so does that mean I have to parse the output to find out if it is a type I'm looking for?

Thanks,

Yes, sure is, I attached my function below:

function file_type($src){
	$exec = '/usr/bin/file -ib '.$src;
	exec($exec, $return);
	if( is_array($return) && isset($return[0]) ){

	}
}

make sure to change the path to your file program, but I think this
is a 
somewhat standard place.

see the difference between system() and exec() and you'll see why I'm 
using exec().

Hi,
My host is running PHP 4.3.2, which according to the php docs, should have mime_content_type().

When I try to use it, PHP says the function doesn't exist.

Does PHP have this by default or does it have to be compiled to get the feature?

Thanks,

PHP needs to have the mime-magic extension for this function to be 
available, obviously your host does not.

Dan's right
"You must compile PHP with the configure switch --with-mime-magic to get
support for mime-type functions. The extension needs a copy of the
simplified magic file that is distributed with the Apache httpd. "

One with pop3 and the other two with imap.

I'd really like to know what other tools / solutions other people are using.

Ideally I could keep on using Outlook Express, but am willing to consider other emails clients (like Thunderbird).

Thanx,
Ophir

I switched to thunderbird at the 0.3 release (now 0.4) and really like the 
built-in filtering.  Without switching to another email client, your best bet 
is doing something server-side.  If you are not running your own mail server 
(or can get admin access to it) then I'd suggest taking a look at 
thunderbird.

Of course the default answer from linuxland would be SpamAssassin, but I have 
never researched what it would take to get going in the Windows environment.

Of course this message is sent through kmail (KDE) from a development box...  
And I really miss thunderbird right now!

Ophir:

I filter my mail on my shell accounts using procmail and SpamAssassin.

If that wasn't available, there are two options:

Mozilla's integrated mail client or their standalone Thunderbird program 
have Bayesian filtering.  I believe Netscape has similar functionality 
in the 7.1 release.

A friend of mine uses SpamPal with their Netscape mailer.

For the client side I have a combination of cloudmark spamnet and a bayesian
based processor with ms outlook 03.  Most of my spam is caught by cloudmark,
and the bayesian pluigin catches everything else, which once a week, I flip
though (basically just a glance over as it does an incredible job) and
'block' all the ones that got by cloudmark, which adds them to the cloudmark
db.

I probably get about 300 - 600 spam messages a week using appx. 25 accounts
(most of my spam comes from one domain though).  With these two tools I get
about 3 - 10 per week.

Cloudmark: <http://www.cloudmark.com>
SpamBayes: <http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/>

Cloudmark Stats
---------------
Emails Processed 46,544 
Spam Caught 19,061 
Spam I've blocked 2,460 

And spambayes has no stats for me.

Serverside solutions tend to worry me as I can't scan them in my client.  I
like the fact that I can double check, although the draw of those emails
never making it here is pretty tempting.

It's probably not a cost-effective solution, but I found that the new spam
filters built into Outlook 2003 are about 80% - 90% effective... about the
same (or maybe a little better) than SpamAssassin.  They have it set up to
just flag emails (it puts ***SPAM*** in the subject line of detected emails)
and I can often see unflagged spam that Outlook 2003 caught, and not often
any that are the other way 'round (flagged by SA and ignored by Outlook).

That's an easy one! I just invoke the CAN SPAM Act! It works like a 
charm! ;)

But on a serious note, this problem is really getting out of hand. With 
Outlook Express (and Outlook) I was using Spamkiller which does a fairly 
decent job of filtering the mail. (I wrote a mini-review of it which you 
can see at http://ezdatasolutions.com/About/index.html ...software 
reviews are at the bottom of the page). There are other programs out 
there that are similar to Spamkiller.

I use OL2003's junk mail filters too and have them put everything in the
Junk E-mail folder automatically - works better than any system I've
seen, including server side.  The only problem, however, is that if you
use OL2003 against Exchange 2003 in online mode, the filtering is
unavailable.  Good ol' Microsoft... always thinking.

To be fair, however, Exchange 2003 will soon have the email filtering
built in, which I'm excited about.

	For those who are considering a server based approach with  the need
to filter for a group or company, you may want to consider Mailcorral
http://bsmdevelopment.com

	This is a GPL based wrapper for Spamassassin which handles
de-fanging and anti-spam tasks.  The great feature of it is that mail is
"corralled" and a report of all spam received is sent once a day to each
recipient for review. Mail that has been falsely accused of being spam or
defanged to the point of uselessness can be easily called out of the corral
in its orginal form.

	Although a bit complicated to setup (and a couple of gotchas), I
think it was worth it as it is flexible, fast and a network drop-in for
those with an exisiting mailserver (like exchange). The setup and running of
the system is well documented.

	The developer seems to be on hiatus right now, but I haven't found a
product that can match it in terms of price and capability.  

	I have been running this system for about a year and have recently
activated the bayes filter of spamassassin on a global basis (which seems to
be working well).  There is only one bug that I have found for which there
is a simple work-around.

D'oh!  I'm only using OL2003 at home, so it's checking POP mailboxes.  At
work I've finally got Office XP (after 3 years running Office 97!  Whee!),
which doesn't have the spam filtering, but then, I don't use the address
externally anywhere except here, so I get almost no spam (knock on wood).

I dont like the client side approaches, mostly since I'm not always use 
the same client, sometimes I use webmail, wap or something else to check 
my mail and then the problem will still be there.

So, my advice is to go for something serverside if possible, if you dont 
have admin access to all of your accounts, just forward everything to a 
server you have access to and then install the spamfilters on that machine.

I use a combination of bogofilter and ordb(www.ordb.org) on my qmail 
server. It does a pretty good job most of the time, right after an 
update of bogofilter(look at sourceforge) I might see a sudden increase 
of spam, but it goes away after about a week. But always it takes to 
larger part of whats coming. Ordb is used to disallow mail transfers 
from mailservers which have been marked as open relays, works for some 
spam, but not all. However, the nice thing is that it kills the 
connection before the mail is transferred, so you do not have to waste 
your bandwidth on that mail.

The drawback is that at least bogofilter is a bit of a pain to setup 
systemwide, but on one user it works ok. Ordb however goes systemwide 
easily.

Well, my 2 cents. :)

procmail and spamassassin running in daemon mode.

SA seems to have some trouble with that damn filter-foiling gibberish. I'm
teaching it but it takes time.

Client-side is a buzzkiller if you have to download the spew in order to
filter it, don't you think?

I find that browsing through your quarantine/spam folder looking for false
positives is amusing for the first 30 seconds or so, seeing all those cute
subject lines, then it gets boring and you delete en masse without
examining every subject/sender.

I actually started switching email addresses, but that quickly becomes
ineffective.

Always use mailinator.com or other similar services, I no longer trust
*any* privacy policy as those seem to be highly open to interpetation
depending on mood.

I finally set up a whitelist (source code listed on my site) that I
wrote in PHP and set up on my server with qmail. dotforward files. That
limits my email to a trickle and basically allows my work address to
only be mailed from work machines..  

I have actually had multiple spammers go in and complete the captcha I
wrote! Then resend the damn mail. I quickly remove them.

I had excellent luck with popfile (popfile on sourceforge) but lost my
database and wanted to write my own thing.

Hope that helps a bit.
Cheers

In case you don't have the resources to do this yourself, I highly 
recommend switching to a mailhost that will do it for you -- the 
constant updating and tweaking required to eliminate the UCE without 
causing false positives is something I'd rather leave to an expert.

I use Tuffmail, http://tuffmail.com/  -- they have an impressive array 
of serverside controls and filters, and a fairly slick web interface to 
control it all. I wrote to them to find out if they were considering 
implementing spf (http://spf.pobox.com/) and they were like, "did it 
five days ago." Love that.

Tim and Dan,
Thanks for clarifying that.

That's why I'm trying to write stuff the hard way, since I don't have my own server and can't get certain extensions installed. :/

PHP needs to have the mime-magic extension for this function to be 
available, obviously your host does not.

Dan's right
"You must compile PHP with the configure switch
--with-mime-magic to get
support for mime-type functions. The extension needs a copy of the
simplified magic file that is distributed with the Apache httpd.

documentation....
yea, I need to do more of that as well :)

currently no, the whitelist was a project that I did out of sheer fury.

if you poke around on there and look at the honeymail project, It is
plugin-based and can do reverse checking on the mail and I think I
posted to code to auto-spamcop it.

I probably could hack around in there a bit though. I am waiting for the
go-ahead from work to opensource an ncurses-based mysql
processviewer/graphing program. They are looking into various legal
things that I need to add (disclaimer / limit of liability if it freaks
out and totals some database worth millions.)

I actually had to pull some code on that site that ended up in some work
projects.

oh yea, does anyone on this list know if there are any battle-bot
competitions here in New York city? I want to build a beetle-weight (3
lbs) as it has been a while since I have done any physical engineering
and am kind of wanting to solder together something. Beetle weights are
cheap to make and fight ($500-$800 with very good motors and rc
controller). I think robotcombat.com has some info on some things, but I
have not seen any listings for scheduled battles here in NY.

I have not worked with lunarpages.com, because I have my own servers at 
Server Beach ($99/month). Yes, it's more than the hosted programs, but I 
get my own boxen, and they let me manage them the way I want.

Having your own box means PHP gets built the way you need it, and your 
disk layouts can be done the way you want it done.  I'd strongly suggest 
going this route unless cost is the biggest factor.

No disclaimer needed, I'm just a happy customer.

I don't really need the dedicated space or control, and going from 9.95 a
month to 99 a month is a huge leap when you don't really need it.  Thanks
anyway.

I am on lunarpages and they are quite nice.

They give what they advertise, I run a postnuke site on them.
They include a ready setup click-and-its-done php-nuke in the script folder 
but nothing prevents you from setting up your own.

The database tools are set up and very easy to use

And the price is nice, you can also add features on a piecemeal basis rather 
than jump right up to the more expensive package.

If you can afford it, getting your own server is well worth the cash and 
highly recommended but if not lunarpages is a very good deal.

// Generate random number from random.org

$winner = $db->GetRow('SELECT'

							. ' AND

							. ' ORDER BY

							. ' LIMIT ' .
($random_user_number - 1) . ', 1');

// Make sure there's no current winner
$db->Execute('UPDATE ' . TABLE_MEMBERS
				. ' SET'
					. ' contest_rocbox_current = 0'
				, ' WHERE 1');

// Update the winner to make sure they can only win once
$db->Execute('UPDATE ' . TABLE_MEMBERS
				. ' SET'
					. ' contest_selected = 1,'
					. ' contest_date = NOW(),'
					. ' contest_current = 1'
				. ' WHERE member_id = ' .
$winner['member_id']);

If all you want is vanilla hosting they are not for you, but if you are 
interested in being able to manage your own server it is a great 
(cheaper) alternative to a dedicated box.

The price is right, support is top notch, and I couldn't be happier with 
them.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] passing optional arguments by reference
Message-ID: <20040116163421.GA10841@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

I'm want the parameters for a function to be passed by reference.  
Normally, that's accomplished by placing a & in front of the variable. 
Trick is, the argument in question needs to be optional.  Placing a & in 
front of an optional parameter creates a parse error.

CODE:
    function &execute($stmt, &$data = array()) {
    }

ERROR:
    Parse error: parse error, unexpected '=', expecting ')'

Removing the "= array()" makes it parse fine.

So, is there a way to do this, please?

Thanks,

--Dan

AFAIK, no.

There is a workaround though.  If you create an array containing a 
reference, then pass that array normally, your function will work on a 
copy of the array, which contains a copy of the reference, which will 
still reference the same object.

If that didn't make any sense:

$myobj =& new stdClass ();

print_r ($myobj);

$myarr = array ();
$myarr['myobj'] =& $myobj;

function myfunc ($input = array ())
{
	if ( isset ($input['myobj']) )
	{
		$input['myobj']->test = TRUE;
	}
}

myfunc ($myarr);

print_r ($myobj);

Hope this helps,

Dan

Yes.  The second parameter must be optional.

Can it be done with some combination of func_num_args and func_get_args?

function &execute($stmt) {

   if (func_num_args () > 1) {
     $args = func_get_args ();
     if (!is_array ($args[1]))
       $args[1] = array ()
   }
   // The rest of the code...
}

This should avoid the wrong number of parameter errors I think and still 
allow give you the flexibility of passing the second parameter by reference.

Maybe.  But it's not worth the overhead in this case.

Dan's workaround of creating the reference ahead of time works.

Why not just skip the = array() part and do:


function &execute($stmt, &$data = '' ) {

	if( is_array($data) ){
		//then....
	}

}

Or, did I perhaps misunderstand it?

It makes sense that you can't have a optional pass-by-reference argument:
what is supposed to happen in this code?:

----
function &execute($stmt, &$data = '') {
   global $dbh;
   $data = $dbh->query($stmt);
   if (PEAR::isError($data)) {
       return false;
   } else {
      return true;
   }
}

// ... instantiate DB connection in $dbh ...

$retval = execute('SELECT * FROM foo');
----


If the second argument is optional and not provided, there's nothing to
attach $data to inside the function and the value is tossed away. It seems
reasonable that when a function says it expects a reference to a variable,
that reference must be present for the function to work properly.

Depending on what your needs are and a what your budget is, I recommend a
partered company of mine. Whe have all our server in the same datacenter as
Google, on the same pipes. The prices and service are unparalelled. Simpli
Hosting offers shared hosting as low as $5 bucks a month and dedicated
servers as low as $99. You won't find this quality of service, and this
quality of  a datacenter in to many places. The sales department can be
reached on aim with the screen name 'simpli sales' or on the web at
simpli.biz. you'll be speaking with Erica she's one of the hottest PHP
programmers I know and so easy to work with.

Does anybody with any experience with the Pear DB_DataObject package have
any opinions about it? I have just begun to RTFM and it almost reminds me
of Java EJB container-managed entity beans -- that is, complicated. One
wonders if the great conveniences are worth the, well, inconvenience of
learning it and setting it all up. OTOH it looks like once you really get
rolling you might save yourself a ton of grunt coding.

Though I have not worked with this library extensively, I've been 
interested in it for a while and almost used it in a recent project.

Here's what I like:
- automatically generated PHP objects to represent each table in your 
database
- these objects inherit a bunch of useful methods from the base class 
(e.g. update, edit, delete, fetch, etc.)

Here's what bothered me:
- Joins of 2 or more tables require awkward config files and don't seem 
very mature
(this may be more a problem of the "Data Object" concept than of 
DB_DataObject's actual implementation)
- One reason to use these is to avoid hard-coded SQL, but you'd 
inevitably have to hard-code SQL in these objects for complex queries.

I'm interested to here what others say...

Ditto from here.  If I was to build a phpMyAdmin clone it would be great 
with this library. But of course, this assumes you are only interested 
in working with one table at a time!

Seemed like a great idea at first, but the more I worked with it, the 
more it reminded me of HTML templating systems - powerful, but 
complicated and time-consuming to learn, and sometimes restrictive 
enough to cost more effort down the road.

Nope.

> package have any opinions about it?=20

Yup.

I deeply dislike any frontend code that attempts to automatically build
SQL statements for you, and/or wraps objects around tables.  I
understand the purpose, which is to abstract database access into easily
managable pieces, but it's the wrong approach.  This is why stored
procedures were invented.

So you use MySQL 4.x and don't have stored procs?  Still, I see
DataObject, and libs similar to it, as detrimental - for several
reasons:

-- you loose any benefit of the DB that you're actually using.  Code
specifically for your database - it's its own world.
-- the overhead quickly becomes enourmous
-- why does application level code need to wrap database access?  SQL is
it's own language - love it.

But then again, this is coming from someone who thinks database
abstraction (in app code, like PHP) is a Bad Thing to begin with.

I expected as much from the likes of Hans (-: ...especially when you
consider that PEAR::DB is already a wrapper. Now comes DataObject to wrap
the wrapper. Chinese dolls, anyone?

Anyone interested?  Oracle will be doing a developer's installfest and
PHP will be covered.  They'd like someone from NYPHP to answer questions
about PHP, etc.  It'll be a relaxed environment, basically sitting
around the table, and I doubt the questions will be very technical.

If you're interested, let me know ASAP offlist:  hans not junk at nyphp.com

It's certainly cool, but nothing too complicated.  The only thing that 
would be particularly impressive would be if they were starting with an 
existing pdf and adding annotation to 'fill' it.

If you start with an image, or dynamically build the entire pdf, then 
you can do this kind of thing with ClibPDF <http://www.fastio.com/> or 
EzPdf <http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf/>.

Anyone ever try EZ Publish .

http://ez.no/

I'm looking into a collaborative framework for a community site with a 
strong user data model.
So far, I think OpenACS(openacs,org) is the best, but I want a PHP 
solution.
If nothing cuts it, I'll start my own project.

I once tried to use EZ publish. I had some problems
setting up the site. Finally finished set up, then I
found it's super slow. EZ everthing is OO design,
probably that is the reason of being slow. Later I
switch to PHPNUKE, developed few sites with ease. I
will not switch to EZ.

Hello!

I am installing it now.  I installed it before and it was not so
easy, but now, it is really smooth.  I did not use the automatic
install because I already have easyPHP on my Computer and I was
not sure if it was going to install Apache and PHP etc again on
the Computer so I just chose the tar.gz package.

It now has an interface which acts as a wizard and will install
8 or 10 differen "styles" of EZ publish.

Put it in "www" folder and aim at,
http://localhost/ezpublish-3.3-2/pre_check.php

Really smooth install.  Interesting Install.

Mmm..well, you're right, but thats probably caused by the &before $data, 
if you skip that and then go with

execute($stmt, &$data);

when you call the function, should give the same result?

I've used Lunarpages for a PHP/MySQL applicaion demo. Their service and support have been satisfactory. You will probably have to use a different connect on their server than you do on your local machine.

  Anybody have experience with the webhost lunarpages.com?

  The packages they offer sound very reasonable.  I have been increasingly unhappy with my current provider, but don't want to go through the time/expense/downtime of a switch to another host only to find I'm not happy with the new provider.

  TIA,

  Jim

Message-ID: <001901c3dcb1$4458ac90$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

im just curious if anyone here uses the phpmyadmin interface and package as
a CMS admin tool itself (either by graphically customizing it or such) ...

im working on tweeking some items (like a popup date) and such + renaming
links, etc ... for an easy way out it is working pretty smoothly for the
guys who have to update things ...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] pmadb (phpmyadmin + foreign keys) help
Message-ID: <002901c3dccb$fdafbb10$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

greetings ...

ive recently finally gotten around to playing with the foreign key support
in phpmyadmin - the pmadb tables (very impressive stuff) - took a while to
get used to but once you have the knack of it its extremely helpful ...

my question for anyone that knows it well or uses it is if you can create
"display field" transformations or use multiple fields ... for example, i
have a game linked to a scoresheet table and have no way of being able to
select it without being more descriptive, ie:

<option>Jan 1 2002 (@ 7PM) Blackhawks vs. Red Wings</option>

instead of:

<option>[one single field]</option>
(date,time,home_team,away_team)

any ideas?  the pdf support is pretty sweet as well.

Looking here: <http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php>

It appears this syntax is supported in PHP5.

Evening all,

Any of you know anyone who works with the Enom API? < <http://www.enom.com/>
http://www.enom.com/>

Enom is a pretty large registrar. I've created a class for their api, and
have been working on it for a few months now. Unfortunately, the only
resource I've found is their pdf, which isn't exactly accurate and their
support, which doesn't cover quite enough.

I've been considering starting a forum, but I've no idea of the demand, as
my queries come up pretty short.

Regardless, enjoy the rest of your weekend!

Mark

Mark,

I found your post interesting and forwarded it to our dev list here at
deviantART.com. Our CTO (Chris Bolt) responded with this:

-------------
He's joining the same table 4 times (r, t, a, b) just to get the 
entire result as one row, when he could just join it once and get four 
rows back, and add a few lines of PHP to 'flatten' the rows and get the 
exact same end result. And his query would be:

  SELECT
   p.profile_id,
   p.account_id,
   p.profile_title,
   p.profile_default,
   d.*,
   ds.state_title,
   dc.country_title
  FROM
   TABLE_ACCOUNT_PROFILES p
    LEFT JOIN
     TABLE_ACCOUNT_PROFILE_DETAILS d
     ON p.profile_id = d.profile_id
      LEFT JOIN
      TABLE_STATES ds
      ON d.state_id = ds.state_id
       LEFT JOIN
       TABLE_COUNTRIES dc
       ON d.country_id = dc.country_id
  WHERE p.account_id = 1
  AND p.profile_default = 1

Also, he had a typo in the query he pasted below. In each of the joins 
(r, t, a, b) he left the profile_type_id = 1, when they should be 1, 4, 
3 and 2 respectively.
--------------

I thought you mind find it useful.

I agree, and had originally tried it that way, but I'm trying to figure out
which end would like it more - the php loop or the mysql query.  While the
query is long, it's easier to read what fields are available (for the
designer at least), and it allows the designer to do what he wants with the
layout rather than using one specific design for 4 sections (within a loop).
I'm going to run a timer later today to see which one seems to be happier.

I suppose the idea is - is helping the designer out in this case going to
hurt the processing of this page?  Anyone know what I should be monitoring
besides query and page load times?

Thanks for passing it along.

I developed and currently use a set of scripts that do fairly everything with enom.(domreg, modification, renewal etc.) If you have a question with it, I may have a comment.

Sezer

Evening all,

Any of you know anyone who works with the Enom API? < <http://www.enom.com/>
http://www.enom.com/>

Enom is a pretty large registrar. I've created a class for their api, and
have been working on it for a few months now. Unfortunately, the only
resource I've found is their pdf, which isn't exactly accurate and their
support, which doesn't cover quite enough.

I've been considering starting a forum, but I've no idea of the demand, as
my queries come up pretty short.

Regardless, enjoy the rest of your weekend!

Mark

Unfortunately, I won't swear that my "excellent summary" is what's
actually happening to SimpleXML. There's been a lot of changes since
my message and also some things that I didn't say.

<shameless:plug>

I think right here is a good place to mention that I'll be giving a
short talk at LinuxWorld on Wednesday at 2 pm on "A Sneak Preview of
XML in PHP 5" at the O'Reilly Booth.

More of a general overview than detailed list, but David and myself
can answer questions during the "PHP Cookbook" book signing that will
follow the talk.

</shameless:plug>

But back to SimpleXML. :)

Right now, I would say the changes boil down to:

1) The xquery() method is now named xpath().

2) You can no longer directly validate SimpleXML objects with XML
   Schema.

3) You used to be able to register namespaces to use as
   pseudo-properties and as XPath prefixes with the register_ns()
   method. This has been removed. You now use children() and
   attributes() methods and pass the namespace name. For XPath, you
   pass an additional array of prefix->namespace pairs.

4) The to_xml() and to_xml_file() methods as now one method named
   asXML(). Passing 0 parameters returns the data, passing 1 writes it
   to a file. asXML() now correctly only returns the data from the
   current node downward instead of the whole file.

5) SimpleXML now returns iterators instead of arrays, so you should
   now be able to cycle through results using foreach regardless of
   the number of elements returned. (i.e. even one element works.)

6) SimpleXML behaves in a far more consistent manner, should be less
   buggy, etc, etc.

kinda funny, alot of the work/discussion/thoughts/etc really remind me of
when JDOM (www.jdom.org) first started ... and the fact that its on the same
type of path right now ...

i still want to know if/why/how SimpleXML will be entirely plug-in based (so
that it is available for PHP4) or if its so internal to the Zend core, there
were different answers.  my first impression was an extension library.

SimpleXML is an extension, but it only works with PHP 5 because it
relies upon many low-level features that are only available in Zend
Engine 2, such as property and method overloading and
iterators.

(There are additional reasons, such as SimpleXML expecting to work in
conjunction with PHP 5's base libxml2 extension, but the ones listed
first are the most fundamental.)

Maybe next week. :)

For now, iterators are ways to loop through results that aren't arrays
(retrieved rows from a database, files in a directory, nodes in an XML
document), in a foreach as if the results were placed in an array.

Well it still is an excellent summary.

Pulling together somewhat disparate posts on a 
mailing list can be rather labor intensive undertaking.
 
But with 'clew' it will be considerably easier in that
more than one person can work on it.
(i.e. your summary of SimpleXML is an (excellent) 
example of the kind of summarization which will 
be facilitated by 'clew')

Anyway, thanks for making the subject matter 
more accessible.

Is there anyway to trap fatal errors before they get to the browser?

Not that I know of.  A Fatal error is usually something that should halt 
execution, hence the 'Fatal' part.

I suggest you rethink your code to prevent the error occurring in the 
first place.  In general it is good coding practice to avoid creating 
code which generates errors of any kind, and especially Fatal errors.

Your can disable error reports with error_reporting(), set 0

AFAIK, this is still correct for Iterators written in PHP; however,
most of the Iterator power comes from SPL, which is not mentioned
here.

It is SPL that I still need to dive into and check out. I will
probably do that next week, unless I'm playing with the new mysqli
extension. :)

Hello List,

I was wondering if anyone had any good tutorials or examples for 
designing HTML interfaces/forms for data entry into a MySQl database. 
In the past my databases have been quite simple so I could have text 
boxes and pull down menus for data entry. The database I am working on 
now has some more "advanced" features such as allowing a user to add 
more than one value per field and also allowing the user to update 
controlled vocabulary in look up tables. For instance there is a field 
called "musician" but often I there can be more than one musician. My 
DB schema is fine and normalized, and my programming logic is fine too. 
But I am a bit over my head in making a easy user interface for these 
things.

If any one has an samples or tutorials it would be great.

Matt

I came across a post:
http://news.php.net/article.php?group=php.internals&article=6997
by Sterling Hughes 

Here is a snippet from that post cut-out (which carries the 
usual caveat of being "out of context").

"... 
Much of the current code in SimpleXML is due to immaturities in either
Zend or the LibXML interface at the time I was writing SimpleXML.  I
wanted 
to have cool things to show at conferences, plus other people wanted to
see 
what was possible with simplexml, so features started to creep in.
xsearch() 
and schema validation were the first added, then came other methods like 
hasChildren() and getChildren() (when a simple xpath query /child::node()
can 
tell you this)

Most of simplexml's methods are either redundant, or redundant based 
upon redundancy (hasChildren(), getChildren(), attributes(), count()).  
Each  of these methods are actually a very simple, very optimized xpath 
expression..."

When I read this I sort of translated it in my mind to read: "Due to
popular demand I allowed non-orthogonal features 
to creep into SimpleXML causing bloat and making it -- well

Of course there is nothing wrong with letting an api grow and 
even take on a 'life of its own' -- while its on the 'drawing board',  
because it is in an experimental stage (to see what works).

When preparing an api as a release candidate it is often prudent to use a
'George Forman-esque' grilling approach (to produce leaner and 
meaner results).

The leaner the api the less the need to inject "Klein" solution 
to reduce the discomfort during later surgery.

I think many of those features actually make SimpleXML *simpler* -- to the
non-xpath initiate, is $document->children() simpler or is
$document->xpath('/child::node()') simpler?

Xpath is swell, everyone using XML a lot should certainly learn Xpath, but
it's overkill for simple (there's that word again !:) operations. The
SimpleXML methods that handle common cases are useful just like having a
multiplication operator is useful -- sure, you could accomplish the same
thing with the addition operator, but it's a pain.

PEAR::HTML_Quickform is one really great way to get started with more 
complex forms, and also generates validation rules (both client-side and 
server-side); and best of all the package comes with documentation and 
some great examples, including your multiple-musician scenario.  I would 
suggest taking a look there.  There's also a much more advanced 
controller mechanism for multiple-part forms, but luckily I haven't had 
to get into that.

One (old) trick is to give all of the musician form items the same name 
in an array nomenclature, that way you could iterate over the 
$musician[] array for each value. That should make it easy to deal with 
getting "n" musicians from the form.

If there is enough demand then I guess I just found the topic for my 
next tutorial...  ;^)

I think it's a question whether/how SimpleXML should provide
introspection capabilities. If you know the document's schema, there's
no need for either because you can do $document->foo instead which is
simpler than either choice.

If you do want to maneuver through an arbitrary document, I think DOM
or SimpleXML/XPath is the way to go.

There is  a html drop down menu option (called multiple I think) which 
allows you to select more than one item in the drop down. Then you 
stuff it into an array, put it into the form you want for insertion and 
proceed as usual.

although the name 'dadabik' is a little strange, you might 
go to their site for some ideas

http://www.dadabik.org/

according to a blurb on the site:
  DaDaBIK is a free PHP application that allows you to 
easily create a highly customizable Web form interface for a 
MySQL database in order to search, insert, update and delete 
records; all you need do is specify a few configuration 
parameters.

hope that helps,

This is unbelievable.  Don't trust "bug" reports from people with email =
addresses like linux4ever at yahoo.com.  From the fork() man page:

The child process has its own copy of the parent's descriptors.
These descriptors reference the same underlying objects, so
that, for instance, file pointers in file objects are shared
between the child and the parent, so that an lseek(2) on a
descriptor in the child process can affect a subsequent read(2)
or write(2) by the parent.  This descriptor copying is also
used by the shell to establish standard input and output for
newly created processes as well as to set up pipes.

I know not everyone on the list can 
make it to our booth at LinuxWorld.

So, I thought the readers of this list 
might like to hear something about 
how things went the first day.

Firstly, if I had had my thinking cap on, 
I would have kept a written journal.
As it is, I will have to give the scraps 
of things which I can remember 'off the cuff'.

I arrived later that I had intended -- 
about noon.

The booth is located in the .org 
pavilion on a fairly well-trafficked 
row. Our booth is between the 'Bastille 
Linux' booth(#4) and NYLUG's booth (#12).
(if you really interested here's a link 
to a map:
http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/linuxworldny/V40/floorplan/floorplan.cvn?map
=10 )

Our booth is not to far from the O'Reilly 
boot (#357) and that seemed at first to be 
where most of the foot-traffic was flowing 
from -- but later I noticed that the flow 
changed direction and strength randomly.

We ran out of some of the handouts and 
ran low on others -- there is a lot of 
interest.

Whoops this post rambled longer than I 
intended, sorry. If there is something 
that you want to know about at the expo 
contact me off list and I will try and 
act as you 'eyes and ears' at the show -- 
that is of course with restrictions caused 
by the limited time I will have at my disposal.

As a (mostly lurking) recent subsbcriber to this list I just wanted to

I was the guy who mentioned that we use postgresql instead of mysql, and 
that I have written (among many other apps) an ldap-based web 
authentication system using php.  I second Tim's recommendation that 
anyone who can should definitely try to make it by the nyphp booth.

"Microsoft applies for a patent on xml format"

Almost all the moves Microsoft makes
could be qualified as 'disturbing' -- 
Is this news -- no this it is the old 
'dog bites man' -- the article says 
something like "Microsoft is going to 
make a move to extract fees from other companies..."

Hello there guys from 'down under' -- c'mon 
why do you thing Microsoft copyrights everything?

The whole copyright law (at least in the U.S.)
is getting warped. It used to be you protected an 
author's intellectual property for a set amount of 
time (17 years I think it was) (and another amount of 
time connected to the death of the author) with the 
possibility of one extension. After that it the work 
was supposed to be place in the public domain and 
everyone could use it freely.

Now corporations (which never die) effectively can create 
copyrights which may be able to (for all real purposes) stay 
effect in perpetuity -- and never reach the public domain.

Anyway these marketing moves (attempts to extract fees from 
companies) by Microsoft are going to 'blow up' in their face.

Witness the announcement that there was no longer going to 
be any support for older windows (Windows 98 etc.) That 
'marketing move' was a blatant attempt to move customers 
to the XP licensing model and ensure that Microsoft 
would be able to 'extract their fee' -- that went over 
like a 'lead balloon'. Microsoft had to do a quick 180 
degree turn, because of the customer uproar against that 
move.

Also at Linux World the Microsoft booth has a slogan 
of (as I recall) "get all the facts" . It is as if to 
say the open source community is knowingly withholding vital 
information which could affect your decision as to 
whether to go with 'closed source' or 'open source'.

Well I'll leave that alone...

Tim Gales made me realize recently how unreliable the sources of some of
this information are (he asked for verification of a vulnerability on this
list, and the claim was totally false).

It doesn't take too terribly long to verify the validitity, or lack
thereof, of what is mentioned on Security Focus relating to PHP. Maybe
NYPHP could host a Snopes-like site for this type of thing. :-)

I've been looking for a similar solution for getting file information which

incredible solution:

I'll be delivering a short hands-on "what is it?" seminar on 
[CompTIA] Security+/i-Net+ using Knoppix, and there's been 
an idea about security as it applies to AMP in the back of 
my mind.  This looks like a time to at least mention it.

I was thinking that it would be a really cool and helpful 
project for interested NYPHP members to set up what amounts 
to a 'honeypot' -- with a different twist -- for 
proving/testing/evaluating/hacking/messing-with/bashing an 
AMP platform/apps./utilities/whatever.

For example, a "you-can't-mess-this-box-up" platform could 
be set up using first of all, one O/S and then later 
including other flavors -- Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, etc.

There are an untold myriad of learning/best-practice 
scenarios that can result with an ongoing project like this. 
  And I believe NYPHP has the horsepower to pull it off.

just a thought...

in the "real world" is nessus pretty much a legit testing method based on
php developers experience?  for example go here:

http://cgi.nessus.org/plugins/search.html

and type "php" ... what pops up seems to be php sigs for examining some more
common php apps, what id like to see a bit of a more compact type of nessus
which can take those same sigs + sql injections + some other nasties and put
into a free tool (maybe developed in php) ...

I think it's just a much better nmap (or nmapfe for the

Well, nessus is open source (I couldn't tell if you were suggesting
otherwise), and it's basically just a tool that has a nice plugin
architecture. So, most of its actual usefulness comes from the plugins and
not so much the tool.

Since anyone can write a plugin, I imagine that there are some good
plugins and a lot of bad ones. I can't imagine automating Web application
security with a lot of success, and most of those PHP plugins appear to
test for specific known vulnerabilities in popular PHP packages such as
the Nukes and phpBB (all of which are favorites on Security Focus).

A snopes-like site would be great.
I would add that not only security issues but "myths" about PHP itself 
would need to be addressed.

I had a similar problem a couple weeks ago, and had to balance between 
apache and php configurations to make it work.  The php.ini parameters 
were max_execution_time and max_input_time, which for my problem both 
had to be tweaked...

> i can post php.ini and httpd.conf if you want.

php.ini might help.  I'm a lurker so I hope this is ok - and if not, 
someone hit me with a cluestick and I will suddenly make sense again.

Very interesting. My own experience is that the Linux desktop is not 
quite ready for prime time...at least in terms of replacing the Office 
suite. However, for my kids to get email and surf the web...it's 
absolutely fine.

As I'm sure I've expressed before, I've been using linux as my primary
desktop for a couple of years and would say I'm 95% satisfied with it.

It's true that the "Office" functions are somewhat lacking and/or
problematic, so I do keep a W2k machine here that I connect to with VNC
(no extra monitors).

One of the stranger problems I end up having is that Mozilla works better
than IE, so when I'm doing "tricky" front-end stuff, I have to
modify/rewrite code to support the ailing browser.

I've been using linux exclusively on the desktop for at least 5 or 6 
years, and I've even forced my wife and children to accompany me on this 
bizarre journey.  For the most part, problems have been minimal (friends 
emailing jokes in Powerpoint(?!), lousy printer drivers, total lack of 
email virus infections).  I even got Internet Explorer running via Wine, 
so prototyping front-ends was not an issue and I got to experience the 
joy and wonder of a completely crippled application.

The thing that forced me to install a 'doze partition was Macromedia. 
As I got more and more involved in the front-end of application design, 
the more I needed to know how to create Flash and Director animation. So 
I do have to boot into XP, and hate it the entire time I am there - my 
cheapo AC'97 audio stinks up the house in Windows, but the ALSA driver 
sounds wonderful - but for the most part XP has pretty much caught up to 
Linux.  As soon as I can get decent virtual-desktop support, I will be 
happy.

I do so much work in MS Word (and the documents need to be shareable 
with clients) that, though I tried using OpenOffice...it just didn't fit 
the bill.

Sorry to not have any PHP related content in this response, but this may
help those that are stranded between *NIX and Windows for developing.

In windows XP they have a 'power toy' that gives you four virtual
desktops.  I think its called Microsoft virtual desktop manager(MSVDM). 
Its not as smooth as in *NIX but hey it lets me run an X server on
desktop 4 and the rest for other applications.  Although I am mainly on
a FreeBSD workstation and not so much Windows anymore.

Also you can get UNIX services for windows (I have yet to install it)
which I believe includes an X server for XP Pro (wont install on home). 
As well as the ability to run shell scripts natively(wrong term?) in XP
ala /bin/sh?  At one point you could get them to send you the CD for
just shipping and handling (not sure if its still going on) which is how
I got mine.

I would provide links if I had any, but since I would have to Google
them out I'll let those interested track it down.

Happy Coding

greetings, basic question ...

when oo-ing your code is there anyway to override the strval() function if
its being performed on your object?  in java its likened to having a known
function (toString()) but if someone decided to debug an object in php can
they do something similar to the same so u can see ur variable sets?

strval($myObject)

"x -> foo, y-> bar"

In PHP 5, there's a __toString() method. Also, have you tried doing
foreach on the object?

This works in PHP 4 and PHP 5:

class foo {
   var $a = 1;
   var $b = 'php';
}

$foo = new foo;
foreach ($foo as $k => $v) {
    print "$k: $v\n";
}

a: 1
b: php

I don't remember how PHP 5 modifies this to account for private and
protected variables, but it should be easy to check. :) Also, if
you're storing variables and arrays in the properties, you'll need to
do a print_r() on them or otherwise check their type and handle them
accordingly.

There's also the PHP 5 introspection functions, but I won't be getting
around to reading up on that until next month, so you're on your own
here. Meanwhile you could check out the January 2004 issue of Linux
Magazine (I picked up a free copy at LinuxWorld Expo) or check out:

Didn't even know it existed (I used to have these "toys" with Win 98).

Now...just to make sure I *still* take a swipe at WinXP...is it fair to 
complain that this is not part of the standard install? ;)

Well the 'power toys' only work in the English language --
so they don't fit in the world-wide distribution 
scheme.

Another thing is that if Microsoft were to put the 
power toy in the standard install, they would have to 
support it.

If you have ever had to support software you've 
written for windows, the phrase 'dll hell' 
will probably be emotionally charged with 
unpleasant memories.

Trying to explain to customers that they have 
altered the dynamic linking path for an 
executable can be a major time-waster.

Along these lines, I think (or rather recall 
dimly) that many PHP installation instructions 
suggest you put your php dll's in the 'system32' 
(or the equivalent) folder.

If you follow that advice, it can make setting up 
a (windows) test environment to compare PHP 4 and 
PHP 5 a real battle.

I spent too many years dealing with DLL Hell starting with Win 3.0 and 
it's one of the reasons why I've turned against MS. While on the one 
hand I think they have accomplished a great thing - I've built apps that 
tie MS Access into Word and Excel (and have done the same with most 
every flavor of Visual Basic beginning with 3.0) - I've also spent 
extraordinary amounts of time making sure that there were no DLL version 
issues, etc.

So yes, you're absolutely correct...if the virtual desktop was part of 
the standard install they'd then have to support it. Maybe if they 
weren't always trying to conquer the world, they'd have time to add (and 
support) things like this in their standard installation.

Overall, I view Microsoft as the software equivalent of AOL. In the same 
way that AOL made it possible for my parents generation to use email and 
browse the net, Microsoft has brought general software application use 
to the masses. But in both cases, this popularization comes with a 
price...measured, of course, in "software headache units."

It's actually a good idea that it is NOT part of the standard install. I 
found this 'toy' some time ago and tried it out. I lasted for not quite 
one evening, as the jerkiness and performance woes forced me to remove 
the offending executable... Every time I switched desktops I had to save 
all open documents for fear of losing anything important!

Well Microsoft operating systems tend not to 'lock up' 
the way they used to after David Cutler was employed to 
work on NT.

See:
http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/docs/Windows-NT_is_VMS_re-implemented.htm
l

and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cutler

I always would recommend to junior programmers working on 'VMS' 
projects to check the historical timelines of VMS and 
Unix before continuing to complain that they wanted to work on 
'newer' operating systems like Unix.
(in point of fact VMS is newer and for my money fixed things
which could be characterized as 'occasionally problematic' in
Unix)

Once a week I light a candle for the WMS on the Itanium chip 
project at HP and hope everyone will come to their senses.

You are making my case for me.

I am sorry that my posts require effort to 
understand ( I don't spend the time to 
put them in proper shape)

But take a look again (you followed the 
first link right?) at the part about
"The "real operating system features" you speak of are at the UI and
API level.  They are not the reasons we consider NT to be a
reimplementation of VMS at the internal level."

And look again at the part about 
"Windows API mentality"

Possible - yes
Easy - no

If I understand you correctly you want to copy a database from one 
server to another using php.

It is going to be much more efficient to use the shell commands than 
trying to go through the mysql extension for php, because it is 
restricted to executing only one sql command at a time, so each query 
would have to be executed separately.

Not to mention you would need to devise some system to read data from 
your source database and convert it into SQL to execute against the 
second database.

I am not sure exactly what the purpose of your script is, but you might 
be able to get some good pointers from checking out the source of 
phpMyAdmin.

were. The conversation seemed more animated and interesting.

im actually trying to work in a "Sync" button into phpMyAdmin, the purpose
is that im using 1 db for local dev w/ code as such for virtual setups +
dont want to mirror the same grant tables:

if ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] == "mysite") {
  mysql_connect("localhost","localuser","localpass");
  mysql_select_db("my_db");
 } else {
  mysql_connect("remoteserver","remoteuser","remotepass");
  mysql_select_db("my_db");
 }

You could look into phpmyadmin's export funcions, have it generate the
exported sql, and then run it's own import functions of that sql onto your
production server.  You would just need to allow access fro myour local
server to your production server, byut phpMyAdmin does have al lthe
functionality you would need.

Their sql generation functions (export) are pretty nice and well thought
out.  If you'd like to separate it from the innards of phpMyadmin, I highly
recommend using them.   And the import functions basically ignores all the
comments and loops through statement by statement split by semicolons.

Good luck!'

built-in phpMyAdmin export and import functions.

This approach will be an order of magnitude slower than the mysqldump 
method, though you can probably gain a lot of speed by using the mysql 
extended insert syntax when populating the tables.

Depending on the amount of data you are dealing with it might be best 
from a memory usage point of view to break the procedure up, generate 
and execute the structure SQL, then the data sql for each table 
separately, rather than trying to read it all into memory in one hit.

mark -

great idea, thank you!  hopefully i can do it in a way that would allow a
patch.

Thanks for pointing us to this package.
We'll shortly have one...possibly two PHundamentals articles dealing 
with packages for installing AMP on Windows.

I was there for a short time today and I think it may have been more

Jeff, for a hack like myself, i really enjoyed it. It a breeze to install
and run, and it works! Which is a boon in itself. The only issue i found
with it was that alot of the scripts I'd download and try to run would fail,
due to the bundle being more upto date then the scripts.

:)!~

yury,

firepages' phpdev bundles don't appear to be kept uptodate 
anymore (witness the 4.23 php, apache 1.3.26, etc references).

I believe the reason that your scripts failed is that they 
were probably written with register_globals=On and phpdev423 
installed with the default php.ini value where it was Off

XAMPP, on the other hand, is slightly modified to be "wide 
open" with register_globals=On so that many of the older 
scripts that depend on this condition will run.

Jeff Siegel is going to post the XAMPP PHundamentals article 
pretty soon, I believe.  I think you'll like that packaging

hope that helps,
John

Greetings all,
I'm coming into PHP from a Delphi-centric background and I'm trying to see
if there's an existing package for doing parent/child collections like
Delphi's TCollection ? I'm sure I can build one but it would be nice to see
what's out there.

Any input would be great!

Have you tried Textmaker?
I have tried several MS office replacements in the past and this is the
first one I truly like.
I tried OpenOffice, EasyOffice and now Textmaker. Waiting for their
spreadsheet program. They have it in beta now.

Once a year the company that makes textmaker has a crazy special due to
some holiday party in their town and the program is less than $12. :-)

Well, I teach a PHP/MySQL introductory course among other 
things such as Linux, but Colorado is a long way to come for 
tutoring :)  I'd been away from coding for a couple of years 
and am now starting to dive back in.  and... the only way to 
learn it is to code/debug/test/code/debug/test/code...

My students think I'm nuts when I tell them I hope their 
programs don't work the first time 'cause they'll learn so 
much more debugging them :)

I tend to try to seperate my php and xhtml as much as i can, but when I do
have to use php within my html (for loops for instance), I try to put ONLY
php code and vars in php tags and I exit php for ALL html.  
 
for instance i try to:
 
<table id="items>
<tr>
    <td><a href="index.php?page=<?= $_GET['page'] ?>&sort=id">ID</a></td>
    <td><a href="index.php?page=<?= $_GET['page']
?>&sort=title">Title</a></td>
</tr>
<?php foreach($items as $item) { ?>
    <tr>
        <td><?= $item['item_id'] ?></td>
        <td><b><?= $item['item_title'] ?></b></td>
    </tr>
<?php } ?>
</table>
 
 
instead of:
 
<table id="items>
<tr>
    <td><?= '<a href="index.php?page=' . $_GET['page'] . '&sort=id">ID</a>'
?></td>
    <td><?= '<a href="index.php?page=' . $_GET['page'] .
'&sort=title">Title</a>' ?></td>
</tr>
<?php
    $output = '';
    foreach($items as $item) {
        $output .= '<tr>' . "\n";
        $output .= '<td>' . $item['item_id'] . '</td>' . "\n";
        $output .= '<td><b>' . $item['item_title'] . '</b></td>' . "\n";
        $output .= '</tr>' . "\n";
    }
    echo $output;
?>
</table>
 
My primary reasons for keeping it seperate are, for one for readability,
especially in editors with  good color coding like DW which color both the
html and the php pretty well, and also so when a designer looks at the code,
usually using DWMX, they can see all thier html right away and can work
around the php stuff a bit easier without worrying that some html might be
ocming from my stuff.
 
So my question: Is going 'in and out' of php as such expensive?  Does it
take more memory or added processing?
 
It seems like a minor issue for something as small as a basic table loop,
but when putting all the elements of a full site together, every ms counts.
 
Thanks!
 
Mark

My old job (software company) used to fly new customers out to their home
office in Aspen for product training, and offered ski tickets or a trip on
the CO river.  I've always found that to be absolutely incredible as far as
customer service is concerned.

Excuse the OT...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] google ad sense + php question ...
Message-ID: <005401c3e1ed$973b4ad0$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

im having a problem w/ad sense.

im running a hockey league website + trying to get more either a) local
based ads or b) equipment related ads.  everything i run right now turns out
to be ads for "[a far away city] hockey tickets" which kinda defeats the
purpose.

so im thinking about including and include which tends to relate to more
fake text based on the real related content ... something like this:

ob_start();
 include("../ads.php");
 $ads = ob_get_contents();
 ob_end_clean();

so id think that google would use the text only based on what appears for
ads.php vs. what a user's page is actually included in.  would doing
something like this kill my server or is there a better way to accomplish
such a feat? or would this just not work.

a year and 2 summers doing applications development on their 
central reservations system (AT&T Unix, C, Informix...)

tough job but someone had to do it :)  www.steamboat.com

I've tried two different AMP packages: XAMPP (http://apachefriends.org) 
and EasyPHP (http://easyphp.org). Both are quite nice.

Those scripts must be real antiques. ;)

yes, it's nice, but I worked on their older system, and 
believe it or not ported their AT&T Unix running on old 3B2 
hardware to a ComPAQ Proliant with ... drum roll... Novell 
Unixware 1.0 just after they released it.... gawd what a 
trip, but we got it all working!

Steamboat bought new systems a few years ago and I see their 
now using .net (aspx extension)

I compare the commercial/FOSS booths to television/Internet:  with the 
first, you get talked at; and the second, talked to.

I second that one!  Too bad I discovered you folks so recently, as my

I took a closer look at those links...I found this comment listed under 
the "facts" to be interesting: "Windows-NT 5.0 was released as 
Windows-2000 and is probably the most stable OS ever released by 
Microsoft"...I agree.

"who  does pro bono php tutoring"

Every member of NYPHP I have met is 
willing to share what they know -- 
so, in effect, everyone at NYPHP 
does (pro bono) tutoring.

To take advantage of the resources 
at NYPHP you should sign up on the 
'dev' list so you can stay informed 
about the projects we're doing.

And, you should come to the meetings.

If you are on the 'dev' list you will 
find out more about the "Tea Party".

Briefly "Tea Party" is (or rather will 
be) a 'learn by doing' project.

The idea is that instead of 20 guys 
learning similar things in different 
directions and having 20 unrelated 
modules, we will investigate the 
same kinds of material but create 
a unified working system.

Like John Lacey said elsewhere on the 
list: "the the only way to 
learn it (PHP) is to code/debug/test/code/debug/test/code..."

Mitch,

Didn't you say you couldn't find a 
statistical extension for PHP?

Anyway, if someone needs one I found 
something at http://ftp.stat.ucla.edu/Software/5/

If anyone wants to use something like this, you 
should test it ( I would like to know how the 
tests go, as I am mildly interested in this).

the function:
void cdfnor(int *which,double *p,double *q,double *x,double *mean,
            double *sd,int *status,double *bound)

can calculate SD from P,Q,X and MEAN

that is to say you can figure out the standard deviation
given the normal(integral of) density(P), the range(Q), 
the (upper) limit of the normal-density, 
and the arithmetic mean (MEAN)

(how else would you get it -- right?)

It would seem the authors (of the extension) assume 
you have more than a passing acquaintance with 
cumulative normal distributions.

Wow Tim, thanks for the pointer.  I will be taking a close look at this, 
as I was about to head down the same path...  And I will have some great 
performance metrics as I am also writing an automated job that will use 
SD on about 4,500 items - this should be a good test case.

And to hazard a guess to an earlier question ("Why isn't there a PEAR 
module for statistical functions?"), perhaps an extension written in c 
is just a tad faster? ;)

Again thanks for finding this for me.  To quote the Monty Python-esque 
paper research character in the Guinness adds, "Excellent!"

Since this is how PHP was originally designed to be used, my guess is no.

I've always assumed that PHP was optimizing those somehow, but I don't 
really have any proof...

 From what I understand, the whole page needs to be parsed into the 
equivalent of php statements. If I'm correct, this:

<td><a href="index.php?page=<?= $_GET['page'] ?>&sort=id">ID</a></td>

needs to be interpreted into something like this:

echo('<td><a href="index.php?page=');
echo($_GET['page']);
echo('&sort=id">ID</a></td>');

so there isn't really any "going in and out" of php.

im under this impression as well ... its a scripting language so the whole
entire page becomes a script in which case it doesn't really matter how you
code it.  jsp is the same way as i beleive asp is.  i recently has to point
that out to someone who had multiple mysql_connect code throughout each
dynamic element of a page.  i explained to him that you only need to open
one connection + reuse throughout the page, a good example of no in and out.
as per the zend engine's real functions behind the scenes im still learning
more.

Ok, would...

echo "<td><a href=\"index.php?page=$_GET['page']&sort=id\">ID</a>";

...and...

echo '<td><a href="index.php?page=' . $_GET['page'] . '&sort=id">ID</a>';

...be interpreted the same?
Are any of the above interpreted faster, or are they all seen as the exact
same thing by php?



Thanks for the input

I see...

I recall when I was using CF (4.0), that it was reccommended only to put CF
specific code in the tags as everythign else is ignored by the CF parser,
but everything within would be preocessed.

So you COULD surround an entire page with <CFOutput> tags, but that would
require EVERYTHING to be parsed by CF, while just putting your vars in it
would save quite a bit of processing time.  So 'getting out of' CF was
essential to keeping load times down.  Of course, since MX that may be
different now as well. (wish I could site a source, but it's been a couple
years)

Good to know!

Mark

This is probably the best read I have found on optimization:

http://phplens.com/lens/php-book/optimizing-debugging-php.php

If you read the bottom about "useless optimizations":

c. 'var='.$var is faster than "var=$var"
This used to be true in PHP 4.2 and earlier. This was fixed in PHP 4.3.

This is a tricky generalization. I had a fine time at the NYPHP booth (of
course) but also a surprisingly pleasant time at the IBM mega-booth. I went
over to voice my tiny opinion that although I love my Thinkpad, it would be
nice if I could get a Thinkpad-aware version of Linux to run on it natively
(with support for sleep/hibernation, display switching, firewire, etc.) The
random IBM booth guy I approached with my question pointed me to a specific
person to talk to who I spent about 15 informative minutes with. (Short
answer: they have a distribution they use internally for 25,000 employees
which consists of nice packaging for already externally available tools. No,
I can't have it but as soon as some large company calls up IBM and says
"We'd like 100k Thinkpads with Linux on them, please," that configuration
will probably become a consumer option."

That said, the guy in a penguin suit at the CA booth and the woman at the HP
booth wearing a bridal veil who began her spiel with "I'm going to marry one
of you guys [in the audience]" were both, each in their own way, very
creepy.

So I think it really depends on the questions you ask and who you're talking
to. J. Random Developer is on the radar of the folks working a small or
non-profit booth. CA doesn't care about one guy who might be interested in
buying one copy of something they make. That's the way the world works.

I guess it is about what you are interested in. If you need to buy
software for your company then yes you probably your would be more
interested in the business section. Wondering around the place I
wondered what all those people seating through all the boring
presentation did. I guess they probably are not much interested in
linux's open source roots.

Out of curiousity I walked over to Oracle side and asked to see a demo
of one of their "Big and expensive applications". They were more then
happy to direct me to the project manager of one of their "Big and
expensive applications", who gave me a demo and who I got a chance to
ask a bunch of questions on what he does at oracle to how he considers
people for hiring.  They didn't seem to mind at all that I was taking
their time because not that much people where around by end of the
day anyway. 

Anyway the companies come there to sell and the techies are just part of
it there is something for everyone.

I'm currently using Paypal to collect funds on one of my sites.  The number
of monthly transactions is small, eight to ten per month.  The dollar amount
is small which has made the Paypal interface the one of choice.
Unfortunately Paypal has started to change their policies and more
importantly their user friendliness which is making me consider alternative
services.

Anyone know of other credit card services that are suited for such a low
volume site?

Thanks,

i think the fact that paypal is ebays payment of choice it makes it hard to "sell" the work of signing up for another service, im in the same boat, small transactions/micropayments in an easy fashion, i had c2it for a while but i think they went under.

not sure what ur total monthly in is, but another option might be a merchant account ...

I believe this bug has been fixed.  That said, I prefer the 
double quote syntax
anyway, for readability, if escaping out of PHP mode doesn't 
make sense is particular cases.

that's interesting... I use single quote syntax because I

Hi Hans,

I'd like to volunteer to be involved with ongoing security 
issues from a distance, like testing code, or contributing 
to short (PHundamentals?) articles.  But we need at least 
one local NYPHP member with more than a smattering of
knowledge and experience in this area (and that's not me at 
the moment).  Since my main interest is in teaching people 
who are newcomers to AMP and other OSS stuff, it is 
critically important they start off with good coding 
techniques (I teach PEAR Coding Standards) and especially 
the security concerns and repercussions of what they're 
doing.  It's easy to say "Never trust user input", but that 
doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot unless you show people 
the HOW of it and they code it up for themselves.

... steps off learning soap box...

I think NYPHP could provide an extremely valuable service to 
the AMP community at large with an ongoing security focus on 
both basic and advanced best practices.  In that regard, I'm 
looking forward to Chris' Security book.

Let me know how I can help.
thanks,
John

We *definitely* need some security-related articles for PHundamentals.
If you (or anyone else) needed a "jumping off" point...Mike Southwell is 
wrapping up an article on php.ini so, I would think, a brief discussion 
of register globals may be a good topic for a short article.

Rather than recreate the wheel, if it's alredy been done, does anyone know of an open source program that does approximaately the following:

Allows users to add and edit 
    -items for comparison (vw, bmw, mercedes, etc) 
    -comparison points (doors, horsepower, cupholders, etc)
    -specific comparison info (4 doors, 420hp, 2 cupholders, etc)

Allow choice of what items to compare

Probably store it all in a database.

Sorry, I missed most of this thread. This is about contributing to a
phundamentals article on a security-related topic? If so, I'd be happy to
help. I'm a big fan of these phundamentals.

I hope to be at tomorrow's meeting, so we can speak in person, if it would
help.

As for references to my book, I may do quite the opposite and reference
phundamentals in my writings. :-) I can recommend plenty of security
topics that I think people would be interested in. This is why I mentioned
the possibility of rethinking our URL organization (and I have a message
from Hans flagged for a reply; I think it was related to this suggestion).
I'd be happy to do the work (there's not much to it).

Chris

I was wondering if anyone knows where I could find the code for
the function search feature they were beta testing on PHP.NET for
a while.  Just typing a partial function name would bring down
a DHTML generated box with possible function names selections based on the
partial string typed in the text field.
 
It looked very very promising, I really wanted to utilize this feature in
our
internal website but the encrypted data source they used seemed more
complexity that I wanted to deal with, at the time.  Might even be
registered
with sourceforge?

All of the source, as well as all history of the source, is available via

This is a call to anyone who has Quicktime ver. 6.4 or better. Please go 
to the following URL - http://www.ekproductions.com/Music_Staff/index.html
and click on Jose's picture. It will open a pop-up window that will 
playing a streaming quicktime file. Please let me know if it plays 
correctly or if you have any problems. Of course, it plays fine for me 
and I've tried it on three different browsers but it doesn't play 
correctly on my client's computer.

TIA for your help,

Jeff Siegel

umm nope...
just sits and shows your logo forever

why not just use sorensen and make it a flv (flash video)
instead of trying to stream it out

it has to be small enough for that

Nope.

Mac OSX 10.3.2 with QuickTime 6.5 -- there's a lot of connecting, 
reconnecting -- it finally buffers then plays the copyright scroll 
before.... stopping.

The progress nub continues but the video doesn't play.

I've got some heavy-ish network load right now, but still... doesn't 
seem right.

Jeff, I get something, but I'm sure it's not what you want.  It loads a 
new window, loads the clip, after about 20 seconds or so I get an image 
of a few people out on a dance floor.  The image stays static 
throughout the entire clip and there is no sound.  Runs for about 20-30 
seconds.

Mac OS X and Quicktime 6.5

No joy :(

I get 'Negotiating requested data' and then nothing happens, for over 60 
seconds.

Win XP, Firebird 0.7 and Explorer 6.

It is supposed to open a new window. I'm not sure why everyone (except 
me) is having that problem. Though it's streaming I still cleaned out my 
cache.

Let me know how this one works. There's no fancy javascript here.

Same as before, 'Negotiating requested data' and loads and loads and 
loads...

Reminds me of the famous quote from Curly of the Three Stooges: "I'm 
thinkin', but nuthin's happenin'!"

Get the band image, then scrolling text (that stops halfway on-halfway 
off the screen) and no sound.  Clip runs like that for 15-20 seconds or 
so.

Thanks again to everyone who tried the links.

Since the last link I posted - 
http://www.ekproductions.com/stream_test3.html - has no javascript on 
the page (so we can eliminate that as a variable...the javascript was 
creating the necessary code on-the-fly), it's a bit of a puzzle why it 
works for one or two people but doesn't work for the majority.

To be continued.....

Jeff

Yes,

Functions.js is encrypted.
Would be very useful if they are kind enough to give us the source code of
the same.

Of course, you would have to put {} around the array:

  echo "<td><a href=\"index.php?page={$_GET['page']}&sort=id\">ID</a>";

Thanks for the info so far...
I've been trying to find "manual_en_contents.txt" under phpweb module
without any success.  It's suppose to be in the phpweb/manual/en/, but
that doesn't exists under the CVS tree.

I just want to see how it's structured.
Anyone know? thxs.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] sessions and application security
Message-ID: <401695E2.5010105@next-online.net>

All,
I'm back for more information.  I need to port a financial application.  
So it's important to make the session management as strong as possible.
One of the guys on the team advocates designing the application so it 
doesn't use sessions, basically passing a token in the URL that tells 
the server who the person is and where they are in the application.  I'm 
leaning toward database session management.
Who's right?  or are we both right/wrong?

The application when it's deployed will have two or three web servers 
handling the traffic, with a separate Oracle server.  We will have 
multiple servers for two reasons, first handling the load, and second to 
provide some failover.  So whatever mechanism we implement will need to 
scale.  We definitely don't want to make it easy for people to hijack 
the session.  And I'd like to make it so it takes Sterling more than 90 
seconds to get the keys to the kingdom.  The application will be running 
with SSL.

I don't have control over the client environment, so I can't force users 
to use a particular browser, or browser settings.  Can detect what they 
do have though (obviously).

One thought is to use both a token in the url and database sessions, 
where the token in the url is a checksum of the database session, and 
possibly vice versa. That way I can check both.  If I have a checksum in 
both, then I can compare the checksum.  Hmm.

Thoughts, suggestions, or even better what is the "best" way to do this?
Chris

This one seems to be really catching on.  We are getting a ton of these
emails this morning. We allow ZIP files through and have to, so we have some
exposure with this virus.  People here are aware of this issue, but you
never know if everyone will think "virus" when that juicy ZIP file is
staring them in the face from their inbox. 

Here is something Watchguard sent me on this virus.

McAfee has released a DAT for it for those of us using windows & McAfee. 

I'm getting lots at the College I work at.

This one seems to be really catching on.  We are getting a ton of these
emails this morning. We allow ZIP files through and have to, so we have some
exposure with this virus.  People here are aware of this issue, but you
never know if everyone will think "virus" when that juicy ZIP file is
staring them in the face from their inbox. 

Here is something Watchguard sent me on this virus.

> About the Virus
> 
> 
> A new virus, MyDoom (also called Novarg by some vendors, Mimail.R by

> received 19,500 copies of the virus from over 3,400 email addresses in a

> Distinguishing Characteristics
> 
> 
> A MyDoom e-mail spoofs its sender so that it appears to come from one of

> *	.cmd
> *	.bat

What is this guy's definition of a session? It sounds to me like he simply
advocates passing session data back and forth across the public Internet
rather than keeping it on the server. Which sounds more secure? :-)

I hate that word, scale. I think you just mean that the session mechanism
must function correctly in a clustered environment, right?

Keeping session data in a database is a convenient way to achieve this,
although there are other solutions as well. For example, msession is an
extension that was designed specifically to share session data among a
cluster of servers. I've never used it, but it might work well for you
(assuming the database solution doesn't).

Someone at a NYPHP had a pretty creative solution that basically achieved
server affinity at the application level. Maybe they'll speak up and
provide the details, but I remember it had something to do with setting a
cookie that indicated which server had the user's session. As I recall,
this worked well for this developer, and he had some decent traffic to
handle.

> We definitely don't want to make it easy for people to hijack the

I wrote an article recently on this that was intended to help get people
started thinking about session security. You can get it for free from:

http://www.phpmag.net/ssl/phppdf/

It's the free sample at the bottom, and the article is, "The Truth about
Sessions."

> Thoughts, suggestions, or even better what is the "best" way to do
> this?

What is best for one person isn't necessarily best for another. The
architect of any Web application is likely to be the most qualified person
to be deciding on the best session solution. All you need is a little
background information along with some suggestions and example solutions,
and you're set.

Just don't let anyone who suggests passing session data back and forth
across the Internet for every transaction be making decisions about
session security. :-)

Hope that helps.

Chris

I've set Outlook to filter messages with a size of between 29 and 31
kb... works like a charm so far.

But yeah, this one was hitting pretty hard.  The NYPHP lists are getting
slammed, but thankfully they are closed to non members :)

The spew I am getting a lot of today is bounced messages that I never
sent. Purportedly from people like sam at dmintzweb.com (no such user)
addressed to random people I never heard of, they bounce to me because I
am the catch-all for the domain's mail. And they have
presumably evil attachments. Another fun day in the trenches (-:

Hi Folks:

I deleted the in and out thread, but something came up, so I'm starting a 
new one...

The discussion on in and out wound up touching on using variables inside 
strings.  The consensus was that the speed differential between using 
variables inside and outside of strings was fixed.

Well, there's a current thread on internals at php.net, aka php-dev, in which
Andrei says that using variables outside of quotes is faster:

I've been getting quite a few bounces to never owned addresses to my

It seems I've also received the zip, although I've been filtering as well
and killed it right away.  I'm a bit concerned that it wasn't caught as
pc-cillin did about 9 updates yesterday.

It's snowing in brooklyn.. Err.. well it was a minute ago.

Something I've been wanting to do since I'd first delved into php is a
browser toolbar (like google, and now msn) for searching the php manual.
Unfortunately, I'm just barely starting with my C/C++ learning endeavor.
Has anyone ever seen or written one?

I know about "show columns from myTable", "describe myTable",etc. I wonder
if anyone knows an elegant way to get ~just~ the column names and no more
(metadata). The lazy way I'm doing it now is with PEAR's
DB_Common::getCol() (which, for all I know, is fetching and discarding the
extra stuff under the hood (no I haven't peeked)).

$this->attribs = $db->getCol("show columns from person");

One thing that occurs to me (which certainly wasn't implied in the 
original question,
so I'm asking about this as a totally separate issue that was just 
"jogged" into the
forefront of my mind by this highly illuminative post) is the following:

If the entire transaction (both authentication and all content served) 
was done via https,
then it really wouldn't be a security problem to use this model you 
scoff at (session data
in the url), right?

I'm not asking because I have any intention of doing this (our 
authentication code is
backed by a database -- what travels over the internet is a cookie 
holding a randomly
generated session key), rather I'm asking the question to simplyfurther my
understanding.    I'm just wondering if I'm missing something in my 
analysis --
the way I see it, if the entire conversation is encrypted via https, 
then it's not a real problem
security-wise except for the one niggling issue of a public access 
machine being
used to access the system (someone could conceivaly sit down later and 
prise anything
that was in the url out of the browser history).

     thanks for your time,

I agree 100% on this one.

An excellent opportunity for you would be using ADODB's database-based 
sessions (http://php.weblogs.com/adodb-sessions).  Using this system, 
ADODB also performs a crc32 check on the data and only hits the database 
when the session data is changed. Combine this with the ability of ADODB 
to cache query results and you have a pretty fast setup (not to mention 
database independence).

Another option would be to use pound (http://www.apsis.ch/pound):

"The Pound program is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end 
for Web server(s). Pound was developed to enable distributing the load 
among several Web-servers and to allow for a convenient SSL wrapper for 
those Web servers that do not offer it natively. Pound is distributed 
under the GPL - no warranty, it's free to use, copy and give away."

I LOVE pound.  I learned to use it while dealing with Plone and Zope 
sites, and now use it as a load-balancer with session awareness for PHP 
stuff too ;^)

Nope, unfortunately your session data will be in the URL, which goes 
over in cleartext (think about HTTP_REFERER and such).

how about: mysql_list_fields

from http://www.php.net/function.mysql-list-fields

Description
resource mysql_list_fields ( string database_name, string table_name [,
resource link_identifier])

mysql_list_fields() retrieves information about the given table name.
Arguments are the database and the table name. A result pointer is
returned which can be used with mysql_field_flags(), mysql_field_len(),
mysql_field_name(), and mysql_field_type(). 

is that what you were after?

good point!   i completely missed that one.

just to be pedantic (well, and to understand more completely
what's happening), if a person were to take this approach
and make sure there were no links anywhere within the authenticated
content to an outside page (only links to other authenticated
pages and a "logout" page which would obviously remove
the session information from the (next) url), then this would
take care of that concern wouldn't it?

or maybe there's a more insidious problem of some headers of an
https session being sent cleartext (if this is the case I certainly
wasn't aware of it previously)

You might try something like:

I beleive you *used* to be able to do this (before SHOW), the C API does
have a function for this (just the column names), and so does PHP ...

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-list-fields.php

Which uses the C API im sure but its labeled as a deprecated method, so I
wouldn't put it anywhere important.

Scoff seems a bit harsh. :-) I was just trying to clarify what I thought
was being suggested. Also, passing session data around on the Internet
would include cookies and POST data also, not only URL variables.

To answer your question, it would still be a security risk. Let me try to
think of a crazy analogy to clarify this...

Say you have a 5 year old daughter. You let her walk across the street,
but in order to make sure it's safe, you only let her do this when there
is no visible traffic in either direction. If there is no traffic, then
she's perfectly safe, right?

Well, perhaps she will be safe. But, why let her cross the street in the
first place? This is an especially poor choice if there is no reason. Who
knows what else can happen, and maybe you're not as good as you predict at
sensing the absense of traffic. Why take an unnecessary risk? It makes no
sense.

The same goes for Web security in many ways. If we focus on preventing
only the risks that we're aware of, being careless otherwise, we're sure
to fail. There is no reason to be passing session data back and forth over
the Internet for every transaction, unless:

1. The data can safely be considered public
2. You have plenty of extra bandwidth but need to save processing and
storage resources

That's about the only scenario I can think of where this would be an
acceptable decision, although there may be others.

SSL certainly doesn't solve everything, otherwise Web application security
wouldn't be much of a topic to talk about. :-) I can think of a dozen
different types of attacks that can be successful despite SSL off the top
of my head. For example:

1. Perhaps you think it is best to store all session data in cookies. You
use SSL, and you even set the secure attribute in the cookies, so that
they're not mistakenly sent over an insecure connection. This seems pretty
safe, but unfortunately you find that some of your users use IE (seems
likely), and then you learn that everyone's session data is being
compromised by way of browser vulnerabilities (see
http://www.peacefire.org/security/iecookies/ and
http://shiflett.org/articles/passport-hacking-revisited - unfortunately
the original source of the IE 5.5 and 6.0 vulnerability is now a 404).

2. So, you decide to change your approach, and you store all session data
safely in a database, and you only put a session identifier in a cookie.
You use SSL for everything again, so that you're protected. Oops! People
are still having their cookies compromised, so attackers are using the
stolen session identifiers to impersonate users on your site. Well, all
SSL does for you is require the attackers to type an extra 's'. That
didn't really help.

3. You decide that cookies must be the problem (and the fact that
unknowing users don't realize the serious security hazards of using IE).
You change your session mechanism to only pass the session identifier in
the URL, and because you're using SSL, this should be safe. Oh no! Foiled
again! You learn later that attackers are now using session fixation
attacks to cause unknowing users to pass a session identifier of the
attacker's choosing. So, while the attacker can't snoop the session
identifier, it doesn't matter, because the attacker is the one who chose
it.

I could go on, but the point is that there is no simple solution to every
potential risk. SSL is great, and it solves some fundamental problems, but
it's a very small piece of the puzzle.

Hope that helps.

Chris

I see your point, grab a row and look at the field names not the values.
But suppose the table is empty?

This ain't a big problem, I was just curious, Thanks everyone.

This is not the case. SSL lies between TCP and HTTP, so that everything at
the HTTP level is protected. If that makes no sense, just know that the
entire HTTP request and corresponding respnse is protected with SSL.

Hope that helps.

I use this javascript bookmark (sometimes called a "bookmarklet") in my browser
toolbar:

    javascript:void(f=prompt('PHP Function:',''));if(f)location.href='http://www.php.net/'+escape(f)

Or if you want to pop a new window, you can do something like:

    javascript:void(f=prompt('PHP Function:',''));if(f)void(open('http://www.php.net/'+escape(f),'php function','width=600,height=400,scrollbars=1,resizable=1'));

For the new window one, if you want a more functional window, play with the
parameters on the end. See:

    http://devedge.netscape.com/library/manuals/2000/javascript/1.3/reference/window.html#1202731

To use them, just create a bookmark and drop the whole string
("javsacript:....") in as the URL.  I think it should work in IE and Mozilla,
although I only use Mozilla.

HTH,
Andrew

I like to only pose only my opinion on this subject.

I agree it is imposible to have 100% secure HTTP session mechanism
because the server application does not control the client side.

I think ssl should be used to increase security as a starting point.
Then use session cookie with secure attribute to carry the session id.

The session id should not be used solely for actions that have lasting
side effects such as POST that causes money to be transfered. In that
case each POST like that should have additional token that can be used
only once, and that token should have a expiration time just in case.

As far as using tokens in URL I dont think its a good idea because of
the potential risks and lack of benefits. Like someone said url's can be
placed in Referer header or loged in server logs. And in general they
will make application more complex. I had an idea recently of having url
variables calculated by javascript which a token taken from hidden tag
in html. This mechanism was supposed to help prevent csrf where a user
can only create an url if the user has already received an html page
from a session.  Even if an attacker got a users session id from a
cookie he would still not be able to request an html page without
already having a valid html page. Now this may work but it still assumes
too much. Attacker can still combine a xss with csrf or steal the url
token and session id to get around this, in addition it would make
application logic more complex.

So my conclusion is to get a good mix of ssl , session cookie and hidden
tokens in POST to get a pretty good level of security and make sure it
all works correctly.

As last resort educate users not to do stupid stuff like click on links
from email and entering passwords thereafter. That seems to be a popular
attack lately.

Unfortunately, things aren't going to work out for me to allow me to

I'm sure we'll be in touch via email.

I'm a token passer myself.  Burn an extra few CPU cycles and keep

I think this is really the key.  Backend security considerations can
only be so good - the heart of it lies in the browser.  For anyone who
uses online banking (Citibank for instance) a great deal of their
security is client side.  JavaScript, browser detection, timeouts, etc.

Security really breaks down into two parts: transit and endpoints.  SSL
generally should suffice for transit, and a strong backend architecture
and system admins can handle the server endpoint.  That leaves the
browser, which from what I've seen and heard, is where the real problems
are.

Good ideas, but even so, if someone can get that key on the browser,
he's in.  Again, it's the browser - but perhaps rotating session keys
can help - which could at least detect if a hijack was *attempted* and
then shutdown the session.

Only solution I've ever seen devised for this is a moving-target encryption.
Public key handshake (within SSL) leads to an ever-changing series of
private keys devised by your own proprietary method. Every transaction
(every page) has a new key. The numerical application is left as an exercise
to the reader. ;)

No, it's not pretty. Yes, it makes Sterling and other beasts like it break
out in cold sweat.

Otherwise, yeah, get it off HTTP and on to your own protocol. That solves
the problem most handily.

I had kicked around some sequencing sessions, modeled after TCP's
SYN/ACK sequence numbers - but using the SSL keys... now
that's-a-good-idea.  I'm even thinking...  depending on your platform,
you could reach down the network stack and just grab the real TCP
SYN/ACK numbers.  But probably not doable in pure PHP :)

This was actually a unique public key *after* SSL negotiation, so you have
the SSL-secure layer to the browser, then the webapp secures the
"key-tunnel" via PGP, Blowfish, or whatever, and each transaction was
additionally secured via moving-target.

The great advantage? There are no export laws against encryption strength of
financial data. Write once, run everywhere.

PEAR DB's DB_common::tableInfo() method has the ability to return metadata 
about a table or query result object.

The method and it's related docblock and documentation have been 
overhauled in the new release: 1.6.0RC2.  The documentation has yet to be 
compiled on the web servers, but should be soon.

The way I look up stuff is putting the following in my document location 
bar:  "php.net/function_name"  That will take you directly to the 
function's section in the manual in your native language.  Can't get 
simpler than that -- well at least it seems that way to me.

This was mentioned on this list in the past few days by the person trying

I think the question from a few days ago was about that weird client-side
trick that supposedly pre-filled a form somewhere as you were typing. How
to do the "php.net/function_name" stuff is a much easier question, in my
opinion. :-)

By the way, when are you going to give NYPHP a presentation on all of the
cool stuff you're doing with PEAR:DB? :-)

The point is that there is a fixed overhead on every double-quoted 
string, being the time it takes to parse it and determine if it contains 
any variables.

I would guess that the procedure would then be something like:

1. split string into chunks (variable identifiers and sequences of 
characters)
3. replace variable chunks with the value of variables
4. put chunks back together

This is compared to the single quotes where you don't have to decide 
what is a variable and what is just character data.  Assuming the model 
above, it should be faster to use single-quotes, because you can 
eliminate step 1.

My guess would be that the 'fix' simply made step 1 more efficient.

All of this is purely my guess as to what is going on behind the scenes, 
I haven't actually looked at the source.  The remark in that thread:

'If you use a compiler cache like apc, this performance hit will be
totally removed as the optimizer compiles both representations into the
same format.'

Is probably fairly accurate, and would be great in a perfect world where 
everyone used caches...but in the real world it still appears that the 
single quotes method is faster.

I've been searching for a good list of potential security hazards via HTTP /
browsers.  Something like a good reference list to base web application
security decisions on (Chris, you always tend to be a fountain of knowledge
on the subject).  Any books / sites you could recommend?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] lost functionality after upgrading to PHP 4.3.4
Message-ID: <200401281915.i0SJF7a18059@neo.datatechie.com>

Hello-

 

I am fairly new to this list so please bear with me.

 

I recently installed "Gallery" which was dl'd from Sourceforge. The install
gave me some problems and would not work correctly. After submitting a
question to the forum - it was ascertained that the version of PHP on my
server was a little old so I upgraded to 4.3.4 (I believe I was running
4.0.? or 4.1.?)


Ever since I upgraded - I have been unable to use some of the functionality
some web pages that contain php code. For instance:

http://myip.datatechie.com <http://myip.datatechie.com/> 

and

http://www.datatechie.com/tools.htm (the speed test link) (login as
guest/guest)

 

Can anyone offer any assistance or guidance as to what might have been
altered in the PHP.INI file that might have turned off this functionality? I
could have sworn I saved the old PHP.INI but now I cannot find it.

 

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I also have the output of the
<$phpinfo.php> file if it would help; I can send it to a private email
address.

 

Here are the specs on the system:

RHL 7.3

Apache/1.3.27

mod_ssl/2.8.12

OpenSSL/0.9.6b

DAV/1.0.3

PHP/4.3.4

mod_perl/1.26

Starting with PHP 4.2, the register_globals php.ini configuration
directive is set to Off. My assumption is that "Gallery" needs this to
be set to On to work correctly.

See http://us2.php.net/release_4_2_0.php for more details. Note that
it is easier to write insecure scripts when this is enabled, so
reenable this at your own risk.

FWIW, I wrote some a while back that search for the selected word:

I know they work in Mozilla, but don't recall whether IE can handle them.

A cursory glance shows that they should work fine in IE. M$ has yet to
deviate *too* far from DOM...

I stress *yet*.

Just for the record re Gallery 1.4.1, AFAIK it does not require
register_globals to be on. I'm running it with register_globals off and
it seems to be fine.

My initial guess -- without ever having looked at the program or knowing 
anything about it, so take this with a pound of salt -- was that the new 
php.ini file didn't have the needed extension uncommented (or it wasn't 
compiled in, if that's the route use for the platform you're on).

FWIW, Gallery 1.3.1 is the first version of Gallery to work with
register_globals Off. That came out in the middle of 2002, but if
you're upgrading a really old version of PHP, you might also have a
really old version of Gallery. :)

FB-

 

Setting the register_globals = On did not help with this situation or the
other one but your idea of using:

$_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"];

Worked like a charm.

 

I am still unable to properly use this tool:

http://www.datatechie.com/tools/speedtest/meter.php

 

and it was working before the upgrade.

 

Any other suggestions that might help?

Hiya guys,

I read through the similarly-subjected thread felix started back in mid-December (thanks for asking the questions felix and for brainstorming on the list - I really got my thinking focused reading that thread). I definitely do NOT need anything that comprehensive.

For one, all I really need to do is get a user id defined, get them logged in and logged out, track whether or not they've given me certain information before I let them access specific pages (yes, I need your DOB, SSN, first born child and if that was a male, his blood type; if your first-born was a female well, i'll let ya' slide by unchecked...bias gal that I am)

Really, I am NOT doing any major security here. I just don't want to have to reinvent the wheel. If there is a class for the taking that I can use to create and manage users, please point me to it.  If it will also let me manage myself as an admin of the mySQL database (i.e., not let anyone else gain admin access to the web pages or the database), great. 

This is not my box. I will have some pages hosted on GoDaddy and they control the actual mySQL admin but I meant, I'll want to do some stats gathering on the users accessing the pages and will design some admin type pages for myself to generate those reports....and probably some simple stuff like deleting a user / user's data. Adding users manually is not going to happen; users will not be given options to change their data except through forms that already know how to do it.

TIA for any URLs or pointers - and, we accept all gifts! (but we'z broke so even small fees are prohibitive)

Take a look at PEAR::Auth 
(http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.authentication.php).  It will 
even spit out a plain-jane login screen for you.  All you have to do is 
add the accounts to a MySQL table, and you are good to go.

As for getting the dirty on them before showing the goods, you could 
always set their status in the same database table, and look that up 
when they login to see what status they have.

Feel free to come with questions, I have working examples just begging 
for Cut-N-Paste!

Thanks Mitch. I did see the reference to PEAR::Auth in the Dec
thread and I did check it out (re-read it over just now to refresh
my memory) but to be honest, believe it or not, this is still a bit
of overkill for my needs.

Here's the scoop. I want to to track the user's "place" in a 
sequenced set of pages and I don't want to let them skip 
ahead in the sequence without completing the preceding
"units" but I didn't really want to bother with a whole login
screen. 

In fact, I'd like to give users the option of not giving me any
kind of ID info at all. Of course, if they do decline to tell
me who they are, I will only track their current session and
when they go away, they lose their "place" and will have to
start from scratch next time. Their loss (their choice).

But for the non-paranoid, all I ask for is a name and
email address and in that case, will create a "permanent"
record for them in the mySQL table so they can come
back a day or week or month later (provided I'm still
able to keep the stuff online months later ;-)) and pick up
where they left off.

Other than checking "have you completed unit 3" before
letting them go onto "unit 4", I'll store some Q&A stuff
for my own person info, feedback type questions on the
stuff in each unit. This is the "data" I'll want to collect later
and view in some kind of report which I'll create for 
myself as "admin." 

Really, it's pretty basic. I'm being lazy, aren't I? I mean,
I *could* just cut n' paste from PEAR::Auth, couldn't I?
Is there anything ready-made out there that just tracks
a user session without all the log in / log off screens and
authentication stuff? I don't care if they aren't who they
say they are--if they say they are Roger Rabbit, I will
show them the pages where Roger Rabbit left off. :-)

Ok, but only for you ;^)

First is the form where they plug in whether they are Roger Rabbit or 
not.  On the next page:

// begin php code
$_SESSION['who'] = $_POST['name'];
$_SESSION['what'] = 'step two';
$_SESSION....

That should do it for you.  Then, on the third page:

if($_SESSION['what']!='step two') {
	// ok, they didn't submit the form, did they?
	include('form_two.php');
} else {
	// got form_two, move along
	include('form_three.php');
}

I mean, that's almost as easy as it gets...  The only thing making this 
easier would be using GET for your forms, and just doing everything out 
in the open in the URL!  I mean, I'm feeding two kids and changing a 
diaper while writing this.

I still think the true 'lazy' method would be to use 
PEAR::HTML_QuickForm to generate your forms (and client-side javascript 
validation), PHP4's built-in session support, and PEAR::DB for database 
access.  That's obviously IMNSHO, though ;^P

Awww, gee, shucks <bats eyelashes then remembers>
but umm, I think now you've gotten too simple. This is
tracking my session? it seems to be just a form validation,
which is nice, but I want to fake "saving state" in the stateless
environment we call the web browser. Can't PHP create a
an instance of a "session" that contains the user's state?
(what page they are on, what forms they have / haven't 
completed, what default StyleSheet they prefer, etc.)

The specific properties of the state object don't really
matter (as I will edit to suit my needs) but I guess I'm
looking for a class that already has the methods built for
me to set and retrieve property values, catch and handle
"errors" (you didn't read unit 3 yet, sorry, no unit 4 until
you finish your vegetables)  Is there something like that
out there?

Well, we've got the baby down for the night here so I can give this
my full attention so long as the cats stop walking on the keyboard
or pushing my hands off of it with their heads.  yeah, that's my 
excuse for the typos!

I planned on looking through the rest of PEAR :-) I'm getting there...but
that kind of reading is for 6am before the house wakes up, including the
darn cats.

Thanks!

If you are really after a class, then http://www.phpclasses.org/ may 
have what you are looking for.  What I was trying to point out was that 
once someone submitted 'form1', you could set it as a $_SESSION 
variable.  You could even just set $_SESSION['form_1']=TRUE and be done 
with it - PHP4 tracks that for you (no muss, no fuss, no messy 
applicator brush!)...  Please see 
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php for more details.

In short, you can set $_SESSION['foo'] in one script, and then reference 
it in another - as long as that session is taking place (typically in a 
cookie or in the URL).  So just set your variables for each form in 
$_SESSION, and as long as that user is at your site you will see where 
they have been, what they've done, etc.  The server takes care of all 
the rest.  No security whatsoever, but you wanted easy.

And as for the cats, I once had a small tower that could be turned off 
by my cat as she rubbed up against the case; but our Swiss cat is only 
interested in stealing my seat.

I am not sure, but you may be confusing communication protocol state 
with application state. 

For example http is a stateless protocol. Cookies can be 
used to  create communication protocol state. Php's session 
support can make use of the client's protocol state to 
preserve application data over a series of http request/response 
interactions. That is to say, yes 'an instance of a "session" contains 
the user's (communication) state'-- but not "what default StyleSheet 
they prefer" (that is application data or application state).

After thinking about the above, re-read what Mitch 
writes:
"What I was trying to point out was that 
once someone submitted 'form1', you could set it as a $_SESSION 
variable.  You could even just set $_SESSION['form_1']=TRUE and be done

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php for more details."

In other words, $_SESSION['form_1']=TRUE is equivalent to 
saying task_1 is done, now the user is ready to move to 
task_2 the next (applcation) state.

Hope this sheds some light on the situation.

Cool. I'll bookmark it and judging from the uhh, documentation, use
it for sparking ideas! :) You know, I really won't learn if I don't just
write something, now will I? I was just being lazy today. But I got
a lot done for a lazy and sarcastic day!

Now *this* has me thinking! Thanks, Mitch! I may just avoid
writing a class of my own yet! :)  Gonna have to plan this one out
on paper, though :(

*chuckle* I wish all they wanted was my chair!! There are 4 cats here,
3 of which simply won't be anywhere but where I am--and it's a big
house. Keeping them from sitting on the desk next to my laptop is a
fruitless effort since the friends with whom I'm staying have trained the
cats to do just this (in the study upstairs where there are 3 other
networked computers and laptops and the firewall box -- all of which
make great, warm and vibrating "beds" for the smaller female cats but
the big boys insist on my mammoth Dell Inspiron as the best bet. And
if my Wacom pen "disappears" one more time, I'm going to get
serious--and I *do* still have my claws!

Though I must admit, the little butterfly animation in one banner ad on a
page I visited was thoroughly amusing for *me* to watch the little fluffy
female trying to "catch" it, like that ...what was it called? Nikkei cat?
The
screensaver kitten that sat at the bottom of your screen until your mouse
cursor moved and then it chased after it?... This one sits about as high as
my screen so this animated butterfly was right at her eye level...apparently
she's never figured out that what's on the screen is not real...kinda like
the
little Nikkei cat :) My friends tell me she's just brain-damaged from too
much pot smoke blown into her face as a kitten (they did not do this abuse
to her; previous owners from whom they rescued her) but I think she's
just neurotic and easily amused....and much too eager to help me type
right now. I have a shot of her asleep with the Wacom pen, the little
thief!!
I took it back and she didn't even notice--so there. I've gotta find a chain
for this Wacom pen or something. Why on earth do they all want it? Just
because it's mine? It's a stupid piece of hard plastic and it doesn't even
make noise. I don't get it. Gotta be a cat I guess.

Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125DC1B89C@intamail1.inta>

Can I get confirmation on the details of reference passing when using a for
loop as opposed to a foreach loop?

It's clearly documented that foreach proxies the array being iterated. Does
that behavior hold true when the array is passed in as a class member, ie
foreach($foo->array as $bar)? 
I can't imagine it would act differently but I'm getting conflicted output
in my own code.

So just to make sure I'm crystal clear on this..

In a for loop (assume $i is the iterator and $array the array) one might
assign to a local variable $foo = $array[$i]. At least I assume, based on
doc and experience, that this is by-value. The by-ref operation would be
$foo =& $array[$i], yes/no?

With a foreach - foreach ($array as $foo) -  we are talking about
*precisely* the same operation under differing syntax, yes/no?

and in both cases, $foo = 'bar' DOES NOT DO $array[$i] = 'bar', yes/no?

and foreach(&$array as $foo) should be right out - it's only one value - the
reference of $array, yes/no?

I won't argue - this should be intuitive, but as I said, I'm getting
conflicting output and I am not that good at writing up these questions!! :)

Thanks, sorry if it's confusing!!

I believe it should work the same way, also operating on a copy of the array.

I just dummied up a test and it works this way for me:

class foo {
  var $bar = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
}

$f = new foo;

foreach($f->bar as $b) {
  print "$b\n";
  $b++;
}

foreach($f->bar as $b) {
  print "$b\n";
}

By value.

Pretty much. In a for loop, you can modify the array inside the loop
and the changes will effect the loop. Inside an foreach, you're always
iterating through a copy of the array as it was when you entered the
iterator.

For instance, if you append new elements to $array, and you're looping
until $i < count($array), the loop will take this into account. If you
do that with a foreach, you won't iterate over the appended elements.

> and in both cases, $foo = 'bar' DOES NOT DO $array[$i] = 'bar', yes/no?

I would think not.

> and foreach(&$array as $foo) should be right out - it's only one value - the

I've never tried this, but I'm willing to bet it won't give you a
by-reference iteration.

I try to simplify my code bit by bit until I reach the simplest case
possible that still reproduces the unexpected behavior. Then at least
you can post something understandable to a list for help when you
can't make heads nor tails of it. :)

If you want to perform an operation on every member of an array using 
foreach, you can do:

foreach ( array_keys($array) as $key ) {
	$array[$key] =& myfunction($array[$key]);
}

As always there are any number of ways to skin a cat, if you just wanted 
to increment every member of an array you could do:

foreach ( $array as $key => $val ) {
	$array[$key]++;
}

which is equivalent to:

foreach ( array_keys($array) as $key ) {
	$array[$key]++;
}

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Custom Form Fields
Message-ID: <401A7613.4060104@prusak.com>

Hi All,

I've been tasked with a project that I think is applicable to almost 
every web based application:
Giving the user the ability to add custom fields to their data / forms.
After doing some thinking, I realized that the "engine" for such a 
feature could be totally generic and work for almost any web site.
I looked on freshmeat, sourceforge and phpclasses but didn't see 
anything really geared toward this functionality.

For example:
Your client is a large car rental service and they wanted an intranet 
app that allows them to keep inventory of all their cars.
Users enter make, model, color, year, A/C, miles, location, etc.
After it's launched, the Dallas office wants to add a field for ground 
clearance (in inches) and four wheel drive (checkbox).
The Miami office wants fields for Hitch (checkbox) and Engine Size 
(pulldown).
You get the picture.

What have you done or would you do when faced with this requirement ?
Is this something you are in need of as well ?
Comments / Suggestions ?

I'm considering starting an open source project for this. I got an OK 
from my boss if it means other people will help out :).
Are there other developers here who would be interested in joining a 
project like this ?

Thanx,
Ophir











You just finished coding your app and now the client wants to add some 
more data fields.

While this might not be the entire answer, this may be of some help.  I've

I've been tossing about a similar idea, although since the majority of my
clients are designers, it's really important for me to allow the client full
control over the html of the forms.  I posted an example of a prototype for
allowing that recently.

http://www.enobrev.com/form/

I think such a system should be built that would allow anywhere from full
form generation to simply data handling, while giving the designer full
control of display.

I've given clients solutions in the past involving a sepereate table with a
whole mishmosh of dependencies.  It would be great to come up wth a good
generic solution.

Has anyone seen this:

http://www.dadabik.org/

"DaDaBIK is a free PHP application that allows you to easily create a highly customizable Web form interface for a MySQL database in order to search, insert, update and delete records; all you need do is specify a few configuration parameters."

Just found it in my last ditch effort to find an existing script to allow a community to make product comparison charts, a la Consumer Reports.

Looks good, think I'll give it a try.

I haven't seen anything geared directly towards this, but it can 
definitely be done.

The approach I like to take when building my applications is to try and 
design all my database related code to be able to work with any number 
of columns:

function load ($id)
{
	$sql = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id=' $db->qstr ($id);
	$rs = $db->SelectLimit ($sql,1);
	if ( !is_object ($rs) )
	{
		return FALSE;
	}
	
	return $rs->FetchRow ();
}

That is a fairly basic example, but you see that you can simply add an 
extra field in the database and it will automatically be added.

Another approach to this problem from a database perspective is to add a 
table to hold these extra pieces of data, with columns id, att and val. 
  That gets a little more complicated in the load and save routines, but 
is very good when you have extra data which is only applicable to a 
small subset of your objects.

As for the forms, I did write an app a while ago which could generate 
multipage forms from definitions stored in a database, which would allow 
them to be edited through a web interface, that approach worked very 
well for me, might even be able to dig up a copy if anyone is interested...

The biggest issue with Dan's is when you want to add Option or Radio groups.

I'm in the middle of a flex-form nightmare where my responsibility is to
create the script doing the text transformation from data collection via
form, and outputting it to a pub-ready verbiage.

This is SO not fun, because every time a unique set of options is required,
we get table bloat. I have to note the actual values (list of values) and
map them to literal values.

It can be done, but be mindful of this step along the way...

I'll second that one.  I use it on many different sites, some of which 
have complex requirements.  Using HTML_QuickForm will definitely make 
your life easier.

Also, having an object interface to forms is what really makes this 
package helpful, as you are free to dynamically manipulate your form 
elements before rendering.

Additional benefits are automated validation rules generation (even 
client-side javascript) and the ability to run functions on submitted 
data before the actual process starts.

All,
What are strategies you've implemented to eliminate the "this page has

I've seen lots of sites that use sessions, where clicking the back 
button "breaks" the application by displaying the expired message.  I've 
seen a couple pages where clicking the back button doesn't break the 
application.
Hints, suggestions, thoughts?

I've just recently become infatuated with the Mambo CMS 
(www.mamboserver.com).  Their management interface has an impressive way 
of dealing with these errors.  If you get the chance, try it out. 
Should be great inspiration :)

Very basic way of solving is to use GET instead of POST, which is good for

textareas.

Just a thank you to Mitch for speaking well of HTML_QuickForm because I am
about to adopt it on a project and it's nice to get a little validation
(for my decision as well as my form input).

I'm a huge fan of HTML_QuickForm. It may not be applicable to your application, but HTML_QuickForm_Controller is an excellent way to create tabbed forms and wizard interfaces. I rarely miss a chance to give it props!

Oh hell yeah, I'm gonna be taking a long look at HTML_QuickForm_Controller
as soon as I get nice and comfortable with HTML_QuickForm.

It's too bad the PEAR documentation/tutorials in general aren't a little
better -- said he, looking the proverbial gift-horse in the mouth -- but
I'll take it anyway thank you very much.

You can try:

1. Intermediate processing page that uses a protocol-level redirect, so
that POST data is only ever sent to this intermeiate page.
2. Cache-Control: private
3. Someone else's suggestions. :-)

Personally I have a strong aversion to using 'processing' pages, but 
that's just me....

I tend to use some cache control headers:

Expires:?Fri,?30?Jan?2004?17:39:20?GMT
Cache-Control:?private,?no-store,?no-cache,?no-transform,?must-revalidate
Cache-Control:?max-age=1,?s-maxage=1,?pre-check=1,?post-check=1
Pragma:?no-cache

I actually have a function to generate the appropriate headers...if 
anyone is interested I can mail it off-list.  It can also generate 
appropriate headers for objects which should be cached by proxies and 
browsers (very useful for php generated images, etc).

Other than than I also use a per-form token to ensure that a given form 
cannot be submitted twice.

This solution seems to work fairly well, the headers ensure that use of 
the back and forward buttons still take you to a current version of the 
page, whilst the tokens prevent forms from being submitted twice (ie 
when a user submits a form, moves on, then uses the back button to 
return to the submission page).

By combining this with a decent url rewriting system I can keep my urls 
short and readable and everything Just Works.

www.phpkitchen.com has some tutorials and the HTML_QuickForm is simple and effective. Without it, you might not freeze the form after successful validation and other not-so-obvious aspects of QuickForm.

The samples in the PEAR docs are excellent for the controller and you can get up an running happily and quickly with them. Hint: refering to the pages as page1, page2, etc is NOT optional. You'll see what I mean and where I mean it ;)

I was recently tasked to fix this exact issue.
In a nutshell, our solution was simply to change "post" to "get" in most 
of our forms.

First of all, you need to check where this makes sense.

For all the forms where submitting the form would not make any changes 
to the data (only use db selects) this was fine. For example, in all of 
our search and report pages.

For all the forms where submitting the form could possibly change data, 
we chose not to change it to get, and leave the "this page has expired" 
error message. For example, if the user is inserting a new record into 
the database.

We of course had to make some other changes, both to the backend and the 
forms themselves,
The backend was quite simple, mostly changing $_POST to $_REQUEST.

For the forms themselves, it was not enough to change POST to GET.
It seems that for GET requests, the browser (at least IE 6) truncates 
anything after the ? in the action variable.
For example, if you have this:
<form action="form_test.php?other=blah" method=GET>
When u submit the form, the other=blah won't be there.
I whipped up a working example for this at 
http://www.stationplay.com/dev/form_test.php where you can see this in 
action.

Our solution was to pass in hidden variables, so it ended up being this:
<form action="form_test.php" method=GET><input type=hidden name="other" 
value="blah">

Hope that helps,
Ophir

to me this sounds alot like having custom product attributes like what is
shown in osCommerce stuff.  if i had that task you could just rip into that
part of the app - or even just use it.  i think the basics are there (db
part) ... you just would have to reverse it into a label rather than an
option ...

Where possible, I use GET instead of POST. Depending on the nature of 
the data that has to go into the URL, you could just send it out "in the 
clear" such as "dealer_search_results.php?Categories=2&State=Maine" 
while making sure, in your "receiving" code, that no one has mucked with 
the data by putting in inappropriate values.

However, I've become a big fan of taking the stuff like above, creating 
an array and encoding it (using base64encode and serialization) and 
appending it to the URL like below.

/small_ad.php?code=YToyOntzOjY6Ik15TWFrZSI7czozOiJBTUMiO3M6NjoiQWRUeXBlIjtzOjM6ImNhciI7fQ==

On the receiving end, when I unserialize and decode, if there is a 
problem, I know the user mucked with the URL so I just redirect them to 
some generic page.

I've seen this approach before by people who just want to eliminate
caching altogether. That's not always best, and this question actually
highlights one reason why. Using no-store is pretty absolute, although
different browsers interpret this in different ways (see
http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2003-March/002828.html). In general,
it is better to understand the various directives for Cache-Control and
use the ones most appropriate for your situation.

This can ensure that a form is not submitted twice (as well as help to
protect against CSRF and similar attacks), but it doesn't help the "page
has expired" problem that was originally asked. The most common approach
is to use an intermediate page for processing, so that the POST request
does not exist in the browser's history mechanism.

Hope that helps.

Roy Fielding would be so proud. If you read the HTTP RFC, you see
that you're not supposed to alter any content as a result of a GET
request. See section 9.1.1 of RFC 2616:

Of course, nobody actually pays attention to that portion of the
spec. I would guess, however, that's why many browsers throw up a
"contents may have changed" page when you try to go back to a POSTed
page, since the assumption is that you've altered something as to make
the original form potentially incorrect.

I've encountered this same problem with no real way to handle it...
Question though:
>The most common approach is to use an intermediate page for processing, so

Does this mean that the intermediate page processes and generates an output
file(or something) to redirect the user to?

It makes sense to me, but would there be a better way than generating a
temporary results page?

protect against CSRF and similar attacks), but it doesn't help the "page
has expired" problem that was originally asked. The most common approach
is to use an intermediate page for processing, so that the POST request
does not exist in the browser's history mechanism.

Hope that helps.

This is what he was referring to during my talk, if you remember. :-)

Of course, things in the specification that are left to the developers of
the actual Web clients (Apache, Mozilla, etc.) are more likely to be
adhered to than the things which are left to the Web application
developers. Unfortunately, we can't assume that a GET request is safe.

Rasmus mentioned (with a hint of pride, actually) that he is largely
responsible for this problem, and register_globals is a fundamental
factor. Because PHP developers don't have to even know what the request
method is, they are likely to not pay any attention when deciding whether
to take some important action. This is yet another reason why disabling
register_globals is a good idea.

How do you think I know about this? :)

I would actually have to say Rasmus is probably right.

The intermediate "page" generates no output and has:

header('Location: http://newurl/');

Yes, I think the better solution is to find the Cache-Control directives
that are best for your situation. In most every case, you can eliminate
whatever behavior you dislike this way. However, using an intermediate
page is more common, because it is easier to implement, and it is more
reliable (it doesn't rely as much on browser interpretation).

Hope that helps.

This means you need to transfer any form data via the
redirected link, essentially turning a POST into a GET. no?

No, you just do whatever you need to do with the form data on the
intermediate page. This approach is much more difficult if you don't have
a very good separation of presentation and logic, so it may not be a good
choice for you.

The idea is to do whatever you need to do with the data, and then you
redirect to a "dumb" page that handles the presentation. Redirects require
a separate HTTP transaction, so you should not make a habit of it, but
they can be good for things like this.

Hope that helps.

You can find the source for my header-generation functions at:

http://php.phpwerx.net/

The combination of different headers above should give the desired 
effect on the majority of browsers for web-application type situations, 
that is when you wish to always see a 'fresh' copy of a page.

Fair enough, I do see what you mean in terms of the browser history. 
Here again it really depends on the type of application you are 
building, as to whether or not you want to allow the users to go 'back' 
to a previous page.

If this is desirable then the processing page approach has advantages, 
however if you are speaking in terms of a 'web application', you are 
just as well off avoiding the extra request cycle and using a 
token-based (or similar) system.

As usual the best solution is dependent on the exact problem you are 
trying to solve.

Would the main database design change? In your example, could the

I just finished installing dadabik, so if you have questions I can

Its a good resource but they only present php with mysql and ignore the
rest. Their excuse because that is what they know. So I still think one
should at least take a look at other language cms like plone or
bricolage for example.

Absolutely!  Having worked with Zope/Plone for years I gotta say 
everyone should at least look at it.  Totally different animal with 
complex requirements (and installation in a production environment is 
almost not possible) - but man, when it is going it is incredible...

I'm happy to answer any questions about Zope/Plone for those interested.
