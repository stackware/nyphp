It is definitely time to be using Responsive Grid (as there are just too
many platforms and device screen sizes to go custom on all of them) and then
theoretically one would not need browser detection. But if you still have a
separate mobile version of a desktop site?

 

I looked at all the options (WURFL, special php class libraries, etc). They
were all too heavy and much too specific. Those old tools were for a time
when tangible code breaking platform capabilities differences and browser
differences were still important.

 

Today - at least here in North America - with html5/webkit standards support
virtually omnipresent, I find detecting generally for desktop vs tablet vs
mobile is really all one needs to know.  

 

So for a couple of years now I have been using a really small  javascript
browser detection script to detect for mobile by checking on a trifecta of: 

a) mobile OS in the user agent string

b) orientation

c) touch

 

In actual use it looks quite much like the snippet below. I've made many
versions of it including with cookies to save the user preference. This
particular one below allows to route iPad users directly to the desktop
site. You can customize it by adding more or less entries into the mobile OS
regular expression and/or change up the logic a little.  

 

var agent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();

// If the screen orientation is defined we are in a modern mobile OS

var mobileOS = typeof orientation != 'undefined' ? true : false;

// If touch events are defined we are in a modern touch screen OS

var touchOS = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement) ? true : false;

// If is mobile user agent

var isanymobile =
(/iphone|ipad|ipod|android|blackberry|symbianos|symbian|sonyericsson|samsung
|webos|wap|motor|nokia|mini|windows\sce|palm/i.test(agent));  

var isiPad = /ipad/i.test(agent);

function check_mobile() {

                if (mobileOS && touchOS && isanymobile && !isiPad) {

                                window.location = 'http://m.anysite.com/';

                }

}

check_mobile(); 

 

This post on a Samsung Galaxy Tab forum has a really good example of this
type of mobile detection script in use too:
http://www.thegalaxytabforum.com/index.php?/topic/621-detecting-android-tabl
ets-with-javascript/

 

There is also special website called: http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ that
gives the basic overview of how this type of mobile OS detection works.  

 

This concept has been discussed in detail too on stackoverflow.com

Hi all, how do you solve the problem of the browser detection?

 

The PHP built in function get_browser() doesn't seams to work very well,
it's slow and inaccurate, it also need a huge browscap.ini file to be loaded
and updated, and looks like isn't maintained really well.

 

The most accurate library I've found uses the user-agent-string.info API,
which isn't very fast, and it doesn't tell the device type, such as iPhone,
iPad, Android, etc.

 

Not satisfacted by the available solutions I've decided to create a library
that with dependency injection loads other parser, so it's flexible and
accurate. The library, Sail\Useragent, is open source and available on
packagist:

I have a stack of outdated PHP, Flash and other computer books (before

they said no thanks would not take them even for free as they cannot sell
them. Is there a way to recycle old out dated PHP computer books?

Hi!

Recycle as in not throw in the trash recycling? My first choice is always 
Freecycle (pack it in a bag and leave it outside the front door for easy 
pickup). If that fails I try Craigslist (although that appears to be more and 
more pointless) and that fails it is the waste paper bucket for curbside 
collection - yes, sad, but better there than in a landfill.
Most book stores won't take anything that is older than three years.

Goodwill does, I think. They give you a tax form as well.

Send me the list, BTW, my library has had some turnover.  :)

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv-eaOf20xbP3hN73Ox-O_PGW_O3g047yKj6juFVwHSRXw@mail.gmail.com>

There is a server which supports SOAP, that ends in .asmx such as
http://example.com/foo.asmx. I'm getting these kind of PHP error messages:

PHP Fatal error:  SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from '
http://example.com:8090/foo.asmx' : Premature end of data in tag html line 3
 in /home/www/html/foo.php on line 5
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught SoapFault exception: [WSDL] SOAP-ERROR: Parsing
WSDL: Couldn't load from 'http://example.com:8090/foo.asmx' : Premature end
of data in tag html line 3

Could this possibly mean that the server is not serving WSDL? I've seen
mention of non-WSDL, but I'm not aware of what needs to be done differently
for the SOAP requests. Thanks!

Thats probably becaus ethats not the URL to the WSDL, can you go to that
url in a browser, generally you can and then there is a link that will
bring you to the WSDL.

That is a non-WCF ASP.NET service. It should be foo.asmx?wsdl for the wsdl.
you can use fiddler or Charles to inspect the SOAP packets if you continue
to have troubles

Thanks, Justin. That was the problem! I added '?wsdl' and the SOAP errors
are gone.

Hey Peter, because email clients don't allow javascript I had to implement
the browser detection in PHP. Perhaps looks like your detection is done on
the useragent string, so I believe your client solution is equivalent to
any server solution.

Anyway thanks for sharing this.

You could also use something like Modernizr to detect features.
http://modernizr.com/

Ive been looking at a lot of responsive frameworks recently and came 
across PureCSS which doesn't use any JavaScript.

Email clients also don't send user-agent strings, do they?

Or I guess maybe they do for images, if they happen to be set to load
images from external sites. Is that what you're doing? Can you actually
tell if someone loads an image in Outlook versus Internet Explorer? Just
curious.

yes, browser, apps, spider, mailer... you'll be surprise of how many user
agents exist, here there are listed just a few:
http://useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php

browser detection is unreliable to identify one specific user agent in the
access_log, but makes sense when you have big data, because in that case
the noise is so small respect the data that you can obtain pretty much
"accurate" analytics.

I am having a debate in our office over whether to continue with CentOS
distro for use with our VM based servers (XEN) or switch to Ubuntu.  I have
kept the belief that RedHat is better for servers while Ubuntu is preferred
on the desktop.  I even have an Ubuntu desktop PC.  Just wondered what all

Easier to find stuff that works on RH/CentOS than Ubuntu. 95% of US Linux
deployments, give or take, are Red Hat.

Ubuntu has a place, just not in the data center. Yet, anyway. They seem to
be working on that.

What runs on your servers? Do you find yourself using a lot of third party
RPMS or custom compiled tarballs? Is the software you care about more up to
date on ubuntu?

Ubuntu has an install without X. Its been a while since I ran Xen VMs.. Its
pretty much what is easier to manage for you.

Generally speaking though, I use Ubuntu on the desktop and Redhat/Centos on
the server.

I see a lot of Ubuntu Server deployments for LAMP stack (probably more now
then RH/CentOS/).

As already asked, it's what you plan to run on the server that is more
important.  How to plan to install it (e.g. via source, or by package
management)?
RH/CentOS is very behind in many LAMP products and the associated
dependencies via package management, while Ubuntu is much more up to date.

Then you have to consider the skills. If you generally have RH skills in
house, then moving may serve little purpose from the admin side, however
there are only minor differences for experienced resources.

+1 for Ubuntu with LAMP stacks. I made the switch from Centos to Ubuntu
without any regrets on my servers.

totally off topic, but food for thought - This is cool. But what the heck
do they define Unix as? I really doubt many websites use Unix. Is Plan9
Unix? is OSX Unix?

I prefer a distribution that is as stripped down as possible, so that I add
only the things that need to be there. Any distro that installs an X server
by default is out.

But really, choice of distro is a personal preference, like choice of text
editor. They all do the same thing, but in subtly different ways. Go with
what the sysadmins will be happiest working on.

Hey Greg, work in several datacenters. The only odd one used a lot of SLES
vs Red Hat. They used 95% SLES and the rest RH.

That's just the Linux portions of datacenters; not including Unix or
gameboys.

I have to agree with others here: go with CentOS. I've tried Ubuntu on
the server and, while it wasn't horrible, it was a bit more work than I
would have had with a RedHat installation.  Software tended to be a

Probably one or more of the BSD's. I know a lot of people who use
FreeBSD as their server OS of choice. Super secure and stable. Will
often run for *years* without a single problem.

That's strange because of the three companies I currently work for, at
three different data centers (including Rackspace and AWS), they're
running Ubuntu.

I had an old 4.3 box that ran untouched for 6 years before the drives

Yep, it seems to usually be the hardware that takes the server down
before an update kills it. Rock solid stuff.

Hi, since you're more familiar and probably faster with Ubuntu go with it,
if a necessity comes up you'll change it later.

I personally prefer CentOS.

Whatever Distros you chose use Chef, so on your local you'll be able to use
Vagrant to create a development environment with the same configuration as
in production.

I'm always in favor of CentOS.  Nothing particularly against Ubuntu/Debian,
but I just don't have any reason to switch to the newest trendy thing.
 Sort of like moving from svn to git :)

Here are some docs - mostly for CentOS but a lot of things could be applied
to any system, cloud, etc:

http://framewire.org/stacks

Of course, all system setup disclaimers apply :)

If I needed a non-Linux OS it would probably be NetBSD. However, I'm
partial to RH based systems as that's where I make my living. If things
move to Ubuntu or FreeBSD, I'll head that way...

We recently switched out front-end server away from CentOS to Ubuntu
LTS. We had a requirement for some packages that refused to build on
CentOS because its packages are too old.

I've been a bit frustrated with CentOS being far behind on package
versions, but I'm still using it.  CentOS has to wait for the RH Enterprise
release to come out first and then go about patching everything which can
take them a while.  So it's always going to be behind -- but I always trust
it to be stable.

The Remi yum repository is good for getting more recent LAMP packages:
http://rpms.famillecollet.com/

I'm using Ubuntu LTS for a NodeJS project that needed more recent software.

Basically, if you wanna play with "new" stuff like Node, MongoDB,
Gearman, etc you can't use CentOS (or you build your own packages and
manage all their dependencies yourself).

To answer your question about Unix and Linux there are two good diagrams,
first at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_like  There is a similar diagram
on the Linux page about the *nix family that shows the same thing.
The second is the Linux family tree which is very interesting of the 3
flavors http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distributions and what versions
have spawned from others.

For those that come from a Unix background as myself, Linux, OS X are new
developments, there are plenty of large organizations that run Unix systems.

I first ran Linux using the SLS distro - installing Linux on a 486DX
machine with 8Mb RAM via 30 rawritten floppies was a good lesson in
patience :-)

Did you miss the news that Google App Engine supports PHP now? Because I
did.

https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/php/
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/php/gettingstarted/introduction

Anyone tried this yet? Or have positive or negative reviews of App Engine
based on experience using Java or Python?

The scenario I'm thinking of involves customers running zero-management
apps using their own Google accounts, so there's no hosting for them (or
me!) to worry about.

I did and I'm very anxious to try it.  The native cloud file support as
streams is potentially incredible, among many other things they may be
delivering.  An optimized PHP binary for a cloud environment?  I'm in...

This is also cool:

Haven't used the others, but I'm excited...  just waiting for them to
approve my beta request.

Yes, and the next generation PHP "frameworks" that will make that happen...

Out of curiosity, are there examples?  I compile PHP 5.4 regularly against
recent releases of CentOS without issue - xml/gd/etc all work fine.

Well, then.  That's one more vote for Ubuntu/Debian in my book. :)

Git (and distributed version control in general) is _so_ much better
than SVN.  Using Git for the past 2.5 years has improved my quality of
life.  I just started working at a company that's still using SVN
(Hi, Jesse!).  It's deadening my soul.

The ability to commit, branch, stash, et al, locally amazing.  Plus the
ability to have local hooks and the things you can do on the server with
hooks is mind blowing.  Here are two tools I use with Git:

You must be aware that you can use git locally to interface with SVN?

See brief tutorial:
http://viget.com/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion
Manual: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn

Side note, I found this https://github.com/sushdm/git_svn_externals for
dealing with svn:externals, if you need to fetch those externals in order
to use/build the software.  But you should manage any changes/patches to
externals in their own proper tree.

Sorry, I see it as hype... after all, all source control is distributed :)

Hmm, and how is this different from svn?  Inherit in source/version control
is the word "control" - why do I need X number of developers sporting their
own pseudo-repository that ends having to get merged back centrally anyway?

For open source projects, sure, github.com is the next generation
freshmeat/sourceforge.

But otherwise, for a general web development shop's projects, git is
nothing more than extra commands to run, more conflicts, more complexity,
and dealing with bugs that have been sorted out years ago (line endings and
content types! git, seriously?)

What baffles me, however, is that folks will also pay a public repository
(github) to keep their code private... guess it's that nice glossy user
interface :)

The sadness of going back to SVN inspired me to make this package:

I think this proves my point :)

Sorry, but the emperor has no clothes,

I'll chime in here... working on the same repo mr convissor is.
For some reason or another the subversion repo in question triggers a fault
in git-svn.... after hours and hours of crunching. I'll admit being way too
lazy to follow up with a proper bug report.

that said.. the bug doesn't get triggered if just checking out a
portion/small branch of the entire repo. so maybe some usage of the
available inter-repo tools is available.

OT flame? Ok I jump in. 

+1 for git... I mistakenly did a push -force deleting days of commits... I called a colleague and asked to push back his latest commit, that saved the day. Having multiple copy is like having lot of backups, so awesome. How could you do that in SVN?

Git is the FTP killer, now you deploy with it.

Github is not an hype, all communities use it, so you're or you're out! All the company I've worked use it, why? Answer above, + pull requests, teams, issues tracker...

I agree with Hans.

I've never wanted to be one of those people who over the years refused to
adapt to something new. But the reality is that it has to really be an
improvement, not just new to justify the change.

And actually, this brings up a great topic for mailing list discussion, and
future meetings...

There's always new technology on the web and some of it certainly could be
considered wonderful, and some simply hype... of course, this pattern in
technology (or anything really) is nothing new.

What if we compiled a list, added the pros/cons of each, and debated it out
panel style at a meeting?

I'll happily seed the list: )

git / github
LESS/etc (compiled CSS)
AJAX
jQuery
Bootstrap (CSS frameworks)
noSQL
Cloud servers
RoR
nodeJS
Cloud development (online code editors/etc)

What am I forgetting? Oh right...

Responsive design :)

I'll add one thing to the git/svn talk. I began working on a legacy code
base that was stored in SVN without the trunk/branches/tags setup. I'm a
git guy, but generally I'm happy with working with anything besides CVS or
VSS.

However, I had to switch tasks a lot, so branching was something I missed.
I ended up using git-svn to keep a git copy of the SVN repo locally so I
could have local branches without affecting the work style of the rest of
the team. It worked out really well and I ended up giving a lunch and learn
so my coworkers could learn how to "make the code look like a throw up
Christmas tree during code reviews" (the red white and green SVN diff
outputs).

Perhaps in August I could talk 30 minutes to an hour on making git and SVN
work together.

Do you mean the RPM format, or the libraries being distributed by a
particular distro?

Using the rpm command is like using dpkg -- no one does it anymore.

is the right choice at this time especially since we are migrating to VMs
on Xen server which is enough change already.

Well, MVC was described by the Gang of Four in 1994 before the CLR was
written, and you could do MVC with Smarty templates since the .NET 1.1 days
(to lazy to google exact dates but I was using smarty before .NET 2.0 was
released).

That being said, I've never used any PHP frameworks besides Smarty. I've
done MVCish coding with Smarty in two ways. 1) I've used a PHP data access
layer using PearDB or MDB2 or sometthing similar as a Data access layer and
2). I've used a SOA architecture in which I used the PHP soap driver to
call services written in .NET. The advantage of that was the .NET services
were WCF, which meant I could have SOAP, and JSON bindings from the same
service by editing some XML. That allowed me to call the same service from
PHP as well as javascript so I could load a page on the server, and reload
its contents with an ajax call.

Sorry for the double post, but tangentially related, someone write a View
Engine for ASP.NET MVC that uses smarty templates called Sharpy.
http://sharpy.codeplex.com/ I never tried it, but if you are heavily
invested in Smarty but want to try ASP.NET MVC its somethingg to keep in
minds.

I would say MVC already took over the world for web applications (Rails, Codeigniter, Django, etc) and now people are moving beyond it to other patterns. A lot is happening on the front-end via javascript with frameworks like Backbone and Angular which is more MVVM.

You should give Mercurial a try: same features as git but simpler
commands.

To be fair, svn is crap at managing branches while git/mercurial have
branching as their core.

Yes, it gives you the ability to select the features you want for your 
application. Remember, Red Hat/CentOS are providing basics and 
stability. You should want to compile PHP, Apache, and whatever else you 
need for you app so you maintain control of the application's space.

That control comes with a cost though, you need to patch your custom 
tools when there's a security update. By having control you can provide 
a level of stability for your app, if you are using something outside 
the standard packages.

Hope that makes sense, haven't had morning coffee yet...

Trust me, I'm one who looks askance at the trendy, the hyped and the
unnecessary.  Case in point: I don't have a mobile phone.

Because each of those developers can work locally.  Gradually making
small commits that make changes easy to follow.  They can use "stash" to
create save points that store uncommitted mods and bring the checkout to
a clean state.  Editing commits to clarify or fix things.  Creating and
destroying light-weight local branches at will if that makes things
easier.  Specific commits can be easily "cherry-pick"'ed between
branches.  The "reflog" command can be called to find history of
internal repository handling and that information used to fix major
botches.  Then, when you're content with the mods, you push them up.

Hans, have you used Git for a project?  It sounds like you haven't.  Or
you're trolling me.  :)

More conflicts?  Not really.  Line endings?  There are settings for
that.  I've seen problems with that in SVN too.  Haven't run into
problems with it in Git.

Huh?  That's a bash script that I have to call manually on my local
repository after I update, checkout or commit from/to SVN.

Compare that to my git hooks of the same ilk that automatically get
added to all my repositories from my templates upon clone or init that
then get automatically run whenever I take an action that modifies the
local repo.

It's night and day.

Hans, have you checked in the mirror? :)

Uhh...no visuals...please!   :)

It sounds like Git is built for large, multi-branch projects like the 
Linux kernel. For which it was built.

One idea might be to put up a PHundamental for those of us about to 
propose *any* version control with teams we support.  I'm on other teams 
that use Git and my skills are lacking; seeing the larger picture might 
help things click.

The Google I/O videos have a good one on running PHP and ends with an
example showing how easy it was to get Drupal running in GAE.

Ive been playing with using Go rather than Java/Python on GAE. There are many
constraints but the integration with many of the Google APIs is nice. If
your app can work inside the constraints then the scaling and management
of your app is essentially automatically taken care of.

Hi Hans:

> Out of curiosity, are there examples?

The grep package on a dev server I need to use is at 2.5.1 (after
running yum update).  The version on my Ubuntu 12.04 box is 2.10.

I always compile PHP by hand. There are definitely extensions that are not
turned on by default that I may need turned on depending on the project or
feature i'm implementing. I guess that's off topic though.

This reminded me, I don't know about Ubuntu, but Debian has switched to
architecture independent libraries in the latest version. Which is nifty
and all, but it means that some of the libs you need to compile PHP are not
in /usr/lib, but in /usr/lib/i386-gnu-linux (or whatever).

I assume this change will make its way downstream (sidestream?) to Ubuntu,
so something to watch out for if you like to compile your own php.

Usually in Ubuntu, those extensions are in separate packages that merely
need to be installed to enable them.

> When that becomes an issue for me, I usually install the srpm, edit the
spec file to configure the PHP compile to include what I want, and build my
own RPMs. While centos/RHEL and fedora have pretty complex spec files, but
its pretty easy to zero on on where the config settings are. Also, its
pretty easy to upgrade a SRPM to a newer minor version of PHP, and apply
all the vendor specific patches.
