                        Drupal makes me hAPI: open
                   source social publishing architecture

Drupal is open source social publishing software that empowers individuals,
teams, and communities to easily publish, manage and organize a wide
variety of content on a website as well as build more complex web
applications.  Tens of thousands of people and organizations have used
Drupal to power scores of different types of web sites, including community
web portals, corporate web sites, social networking sites, personal web
sites or blogs, and much more.

Drupal's roots extend deep into the Linux and Open Source communities.
Drupal had its &quot;coming out&quot; at the 2005 FOSDEM conference in Brussels and
early iterations were mainly developed on Linux.

This talk will cover the Drupal framework with an emphasis on architecture
and programming patterns while touching on a number of other topics such as
performance tuning and hosting integration as well as considering the
underlying reasons for Drupal's wide-ranging success, all served up with a
healthy smathering of awesome sauce.

The presentation will also include a short real world case study of a
Drupal SaaS implementation &quot;the BeerCloud&quot; (an Android and iPhone
application which uses Drupal as a backend)
