<PRE>I am not sure how flexible you are making this (can users do inner/outer 
joins, group by, etc.) but the way you set up the system seems a bit 
over complicated.  Based on what you said, there seems to be 2 rather 
simple options:
1) create a view with the parameters the user specifies.  I am not sure 
what db you are using, but if this option is available it is rather 
helpful and simple.
2) construct the query in php and save the query in the db with a name 
or something valid the user remembers.  If you allow users to name the 
query they construct, then you can save it to a table like this:
table: user_query
    query_id: 1
    name: 'Customer Report'
    query: 'select customer_id, customer_name from customer'
This will also allow for some nasty queries, joins, etc., where the 
hierarchical thing might get a bit on the insane side with a large 
complex query.
