<PRE>Yeah, this is going to be saved in the database to have on hand for 
later, part of a saved query setup.  And although the &quot;buttload of 
fields&quot; idea occurred to me, the idea here is that I have to design this 
to work even for tables that don't even exist yet.  Once a table or 
relational set of tables is offered for querying, the admin has to mark 
which columns are available, and then the user should be able to pick 
any of those columns to display in the query *and* define filters based 
on any combination of those available columns.

The more I think about this the more it seems like I'm on the right 
track with the recursive parent/child structure, but one thing that's 
giving me pause is that a parent record has no criteria of its own, and 
a child record has no boolean-type of its own; meaning I wind up with 
basically two types of records in this one table.  Still, normalizing 
beyond this point and trying to put those two types of records in two 
different tables seems just insanely and unnecessarily complicated. 
Um... right?
