Hans,

While I agree with your general message, I have a reservation about the
&quot;storage is expensive&quot; specific example.  Having been around since before
Boole and Babbage, I can't even recall in the &quot;old days&quot; when developers
were slavish about &quot;storage is expensive&quot;.  We sought opportunities to
reduce storage, when that was practical, but only in very specialized
applications did we go out of our way to conserve disk storage.  The primary
issue was data consistency and software maintainability.  Lack of
normalization created situations which encouraged users to create
inconsistent data.  For example, consider a pre-relational system in
healthcare that recognized two 'pseudo-entities', physicians and patients
(pseudo in the sense we now recognize these as roles as opposed to
fundamental entities).  Each pseudo-entity had its own basic record to
contain address, telephone number and other attributes.  That worked as long
as the physician never became a patient.  However, a change to a
physician/patient's record created an inconsistency in the changed
attribute, e.g., the address.

The second issue was software maintenance.  There were situations where one
record's structure might be modified while the other was not.

I believe it was a natural progression from normalization of databases to
object-oriented design, because the latter encouraged all interactions with
the database to be performed in a single module.  I know of at least one
situation in healthcare where that limitation in the existing systems nearly
killed a patient.

But your principle point is that database design (and object design by
extension in my opinion) is still an art form.  Both database and object
design should look upon the 'rules' as significant guidelines.  Understand
when to bypass these rules, and document those reasons (conditions may
change in the future and others will probably have to clean up the
situation).

I liked your example of normalizing the string 'John', which underlines the
absurdity of over-normalization.  For me, appropriate normalization begins
with the recognition of the fundamental entities in a system and a
distinction between real world-modeled entities (e.g., a Person) as opposed
to system-internal entities (e.g., a web page).  If I come to a branch in
the road at which normalization or de-normalization both offer advantages, I
am most likely to take the normalization branch, make a mental note and if I
later discover that creates a significant performance issue that can't be
otherwise corrected, I would de-normalize that area of the system
intentionally (documenting my reasons and the implementation).

It would be interesting to see if others have approached normalization
guidelines differently.  I won't claim the above is the only way to do
database design - it is still an art form after all.

Phil
