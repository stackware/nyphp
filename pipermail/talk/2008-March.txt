Just curious.

Why not use an autoincrement ?

I'm probably missing something...???

Back to your question;
I think I remember reading something about last_insert_id() being 
different between mysql versions.

I just increased from 1 to 2 shm segments (30M each). But the apc memory
usage graph still indicates only 30M.

Why isn?t apc taking advantage of the 2nd shm?

Is APC using the first 30M to start with?  If it's not needed, perhaps it
won't allocate it, ie, the number of segments is the limit.

I fought this battle awhile back building machine images for EC2
servers. If memory serves, in the end I just had to boost the shm_size
because shm_segments is deprecated (or just broken and
soon-to-be-deprecated). I recall being a little annoyed at the
discussions about this issue in bug trackers which mostly ended with
someone sniping, "why would you want to use multiple segments?"

Good luck,
Austin

My apc memory usage is near 100%, so I assumed it would role into the 2nd
shm. Deprecated, eh. Well that explains things. Sure, increasing the
shm_size param would be trivial, but I thought max shm size was defined by
the OS and couldn't be set arbitrarily.

Not to be snippy, but Mr. Google is your friend.

I searched for "mysql" and "php.ini" and this is the first result with
lots of useful information:
http://us.php.net/mysql

What you'll be modifying in php.ini is dependent on your operating
system, but usually you'll be looking for the line that looks
something like this:

; extension=mysql.so

It may be a DLL file if you're using Windows. Remove the semi-colon.
Restart apache. That's usually all you need to do.

Nice to see that as that appears to be the most common date format used in the 
world. Nevertheless, it also does not adhere to the ISO standards for date and 
time. In regards to date, the Canadian notation of year/month/day is what 
comes closest. I do agree that the US notation doesn't make any sense, but 
what can one expect from people who intentionally make themselves suffer from 
inches and fluid ounces or the worst of them all AWG (instead of cross-section).

But isn't there already a way to format a date any way one likes to?

Hi all,

I am trying to implement a user-input scrubbing function, more specifically, normalize linebreaks from windows/mac to unix. I can just do preg_replace but I saw this piece of code somewhere and don't understand it enough to even know what to google. 

supposedly converts Windows CRLF  to Unix LF:
$str =~ s/\r\n/\n/g;

What does =~ do? I can RTFM if you point me to it :)

I have no idea what the significance of these lines is. The @ is usually used 
to suppress error message output (IMHO a bad idea), but the statement (or lack 
thereof) doesn't do anything.

When you run the query in the MySQL query editor, how many rows does MySQL return?
I always burn extra cycles and read the query results in a loop and increase a 
counter. All the MySQL functions that return a count do that for the last 
query run under the current connection, which may or may not be the last query 
that your code ran.
I am not that familiar with all the SQL keywords, but it strikes me that 
SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS returns already the count that you are looking for, which 
is one result row. So counting that result later on will always be 1.
I rather have some of the SQL epxerts chime in here as I quickly move into an 
area that I have no clue about.

As mentioned above, I run a plain simple select query and increase a counter 
while looping through the results returned. May not be as elegant and 
efficient, but works reliably. I just don't gtee away from thinking that 
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM tr_test_record WHERE $access = tr_access 
doesn't return what you expect it should (as far as I understand it thsi 
already counts the rows that would be returned when running the query without 
SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS). Plug that into the query browser and see what happens. 
My uneducated guss is that you basically count how many row counts (not 
rows!!!) there were in the last query, which should always be 1. But then 
again, you say it works on Windoze....

on windows a new line is really 2 characters, carriage return and line  
feed. In unix it's 2-in-1. The idea is to convert them you need to  
replace the carriage return and line feed with a newline character.

if you don't know what \r or \n are you should most definitely do some  
rtfmming :)

Good luck :)

That is perl code which searches $str for "\r\n" and replaces it with '\n".
The same code in php would be   preg_replace('/\r\n/',"\n",$str);

That is perl code, and will not work in php.  The php equivalent is:

$str = preg_replace('/\r\n/',"\n",$str);

It means replace all carriage returns followed by a linefeed with just
a linefeed.

That's not any PHP that I have ever seen (especially if you didn't 
mistakenly leave out the quotes). You might be looking at a bit of Perl 
code there.

The desired magic was parsing, not formatting, British dates.

Unfortunately, date_create_from_format() isn't a replacement for
strtotime(), because it assumes you know exactly what format the date
is in. The best thing about strtotime() is that you can throw anything
at it (um, except for a British date) and it will work.

Or the MySQL date, 2008-03-02. Again, the month-day order throws
non-US, non-engineers off.

I didn't have that much patience. ;-)

I wonder why you're trying to count the rows in the database in order
to set up a simple auto-increment?
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/example-auto-increment.html

If for some reason your table can't include an AUTO INCREMENT field,
perhaps you could just "SELECT id FROM table ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1"
to get the highest id number, and then add one to it.

Perl sed function.

There's no need to use a regex function unless you have a regex pattern 
to match.  If you just need to remove the carriage returns, this will be 
two or three times faster:

$str = str_replace("\r", "", $str);

While this is indeed faster than using preg, it suffers from a slightly 
different version of the same bug in the original version.  On Mac, a 
newline is \r, so this will remove all newlines from a mac-formatted 
string...not what you want.  The original version is only marginally 
better in that it leaves the mac newlines unconverted.

A simple and efficient way to convert both windows and mac newlines to 
the unix style is:

$str = str_replace(array("\r\n","\r"),"\n",$str);

This will first replace all windows newline sequences with the unix 
version, then any mac-style carriage returns.

Before the flames begin, let me assure the Mac users out there that I 
meant to say *old* Mac newlines are simply \r.  OSX uses unix-style \n 
newlines.

I don't think that it has to do with being and engineer or not. Not meaning it 
personal, but writing month/day/year is just suboptimal. I really wonder where

We've been putting the month first since at least the Declaration of

And if you need to go that route, read up on MySQL's "FOR UPDATE" syntax.

All,

We have last week's SEO presentation from David online, including some code
we didn't get a chance to dive into much during the talk:

Message-ID: <a304e2d60803032343x1e65c448i46f1df16b4e4f9c1@mail.gmail.com>

 I am in need of help. I have created a chart PHP portlet and I am able to
deploy. The problem is that the PNG image file
displays as binary. I know that the file is created and is there and I can
open it with my browser and it displays the Pie chart

My php code:
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title>Libchart pie chart demonstration</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-15" />
</head>
<body>
<img alt="Pie chart" src="<%=renderRequest.getContextPath()%>/demo3.png" />
</body>
</html>

I read in some articles that you need to use the jsp code <%=
renderRequest.getContextPath()%>
but is not working. I also try it without the JSP code and I get the same
result.

This is what is displayed

I do not get all of the the javascript stuff after "Pie chart" above if I do
not use the JSP code.


Any ideas of what is wrong with my PHP displaying of the PNG file.

An Apache a rewrite rule in the form of:

/country/(..)\.html

returns the two characters enclosed between the parenthesis as $1.
If there a PHP function with the same functionality?

I want to use PHP to return the digits in a string like:

stuff [mailid=1234] more stuff.

	Thanks

Urb,

The function you are looking for is preg_match

http://php.net/preg_match

Also, don't start a new thread by responding to an existing thread and 
deleting the text, create a new email.

Why are you using JSP (Java servlet pages) alongside PHP?

Either way, your problem is probably related to not sending headers
along with the image. If you're generating the chart, make sure it's
sending mime-type (Content-type) headers before sending the binary PNG
data. Otherwise the browser doesn't know what it's receiving and it
will garble it.

It's been a couple of years since I've written Java applications, but
the relevant PHP function is here:
http://us3.php.net/header
Take a look at Example #1.

Brian,

I actually set the 'Content-Type' to 'image/png' and 'image/x-png' while
testing and realized that
the '<IMG>' tag took care of the content type weather it was set to
test/html or image/png.

Why am I using PHP and Java.  Liferay is a Java Portal and it is very good,
I do not know of
something like it written in PHP.  Liferay allows you to create portlets
using the
QUERCUS tecnology, which converts PHP code to Java byte code.

I have created a couple of portlets and they work.  My problem at this
moment is that the portlet
I have develop works to the point that the pie chart file is created as a
PNG but I am having problem
displaying it as a graph and it displays as binary.  The php file works if I
run it from my apache server
but it displays binary if I run it from within the Liferay portal.

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

         preg_match only returns the entire match. To my knowledge you can
not have a portion, enclosed in parenthesis, of the regular expression
enclosed.

If I understand your question correctly, this should be what you are after.

I was wondering if anyone else has done this and if they have the code

I want to be able to parse wiki style links such as

[[page|title]]
[[page]]

Any suggestions ??

I can't say right off the top of my head, but if all else fails there
are several open source PHP-based wiki's - you could always take look
at their code and see what's involved.

Something like this might be a start:

$str = preg_replace(
   array(
     '/\[\[([^|\]]+)\]\]/U',
     '/\[\[([^|\]]+)|([^\]]+)\]\]/U',
   ),
   array(
     '<a href="$1">$1</a>',
     '<a href="$1">$2</a>',
   ),
   $str
);

Disclaimer: I haven't tried running this code.

One thing I try is to explode on "|", then I count the results.  Two 
results means a page/title split, one result means only the page.

Cut/paste Word text TO the top text-box, click Convert, and cut/paste

Is there a downside to using utf-8?

If you use 8859-1 you're practically making the application
English-only, or at least limiting the ability of people to express
themselves. ??????

How do you detect bad email errors? Pear mail provides errors messages, but
most deal with things like bad formatting, sendmail problems, etc. What is
the best way to detect failed delivery or bouncers. Detect them by parsing
messages in a bounce folder? Start with Pear Mail_Mbox? Anything easier?
Anyone have a favorite open source script?

If you examine the manual and the code in phplist

No, but there are issues with some string functions.  In php4/5
functions like substr() operate on bytes, and may break UTF-8 strings
that contain multibyte characters.  I'd search your code for things
like "substr" and "pos", and make sure they are not operating on
userdata in an unsafe way.

And yeah, John Campbell's point about multibyte strings is nicely
illustrated by my example, which was five characters long but required
15 urlencoded bytes in the url.

This hasn't been a big deal in my applications, but you may want to
make sure you're using a version of php with the mbstring functions
enabled in case you need them. And where is php 6, anyway?

Doesn't the multibyte string extension overload these functions?

They don't overload by default, but that is an option.  I don't have
any experience using it that way, but it feels like a bad idea.
Frankly, I rarely find the need to use the multibyte functions (or any
string functions for that matter) on user data.

Agreed. It is rare that the multibyte functions are necessary. The
problem area is when you want to iterate over each character and
evaluate them independently. But in 99% of those scenarios you are
just searching for an ASCII character and ASCII characters cannot
appear within a UTF-8 sequence [1] and therefore the standard bytewise
iteration is ok (e.g. strchr is ok if the needle is a single ASCII
character).

Some example issues with multibyte encodings are chopping a string to
a fixed length or doing a case insensitive string comparison. If you
want to display a summary of some search results (e.g. where the
string is chopped off with an ellipsis at the end) you cannot just use
substr because the last character may be incomplete. In that case you
would need to use mb_substr($str, $start, $length, 'UTF-8').

Mike

[1] ASCII characters can appear within multibyte sequences of
encodings other than UTF-8. For example the backslash (\) can appear
within a certain Japanese encoding (I don't recall which, I think it
was SHIFT-JIS).

Same thing goes for strlen(). It won't break, but it reports bytes, so
be aware any validation you're doing using strlen may break. Check out
mb_strlen() for an alternative.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] displaying error messages from PHP 5.2.4
Message-ID: <BAY112-W242DC817E2F88A943250C1D4120@phx.gbl>


Could anyone explain to me how my php.ini file needs to be configured so that can see PHP errors and warnings during script execution?

Right now, if access a PHP script with a syntax error, all I see is a blank page in the browser.

Here's the error section of my php.ini file:

error_reporting  =  E_ALL

; Print out errors (as a part of the output).  For production web sites,
; you're strongly encouraged to turn this feature off, and use error logging
; instead (see below).  Keeping display_errors enabled on a production web site
; may reveal security information to end users, such as file paths on your Web
; server, your database schema or other information.
display_errors = On

; Even when display_errors is on, errors that occur during PHP's startup
; sequence are not displayed.  It's strongly recommended to keep
; display_startup_errors off, except for when debugging.
display_startup_errors = On

; Log errors into a log file (server-specific log, stderr, or error_log (below))
; As stated above, you're strongly advised to use error logging in place of
; error displaying on production web sites.
log_errors = On

; Set maximum length of log_errors. In error_log information about the source is
; added. The default is 1024 and 0 allows to not apply any maximum length at all.
log_errors_max_len = 1024

; Do not log repeated messages. Repeated errors must occur in same file on same
; line until ignore_repeated_source is set true.
ignore_repeated_errors = Off

; Ignore source of message when ignoring repeated messages. When this setting
; is On you will not log errors with repeated messages from different files or
; source lines.
ignore_repeated_source = Off

; If this parameter is set to Off, then memory leaks will not be shown (on
; stdout or in the log). This has only effect in a debug compile, and if
; error reporting includes E_WARNING in the allowed list
report_memleaks = On

;report_zend_debug = 0

; Store the last error/warning message in $php_errormsg (boolean).
track_errors = Off

; Disable the inclusion of HTML tags in error messages.
; Note: Never use this feature for production boxes.
html_errors = Off

It's too much to ask people to READ things, much less to write well any 
more.

No, really scary. This gent is going to be writing code on a website

you'll end up cleaning off of someone's PC.

/me yearns for the days where Information Engineering was actually a
practised and respected discipline! ERDs, Data Definitions, Data
Flow Diagrams... Yourdon was my hero!

Clearly defined specs, phases, payment based on the passing of the
predefined unit testing... final payment after documentation is
finished and delivered. Those days are gone forever...

Does anyone have experience with using the the "accept-charset" attribute on
FORMs?

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-accept-charset

I read this, but I am not sure what the net result is:
"The client must interpret this list as an exclusive-or list, i.e., the
server is able to accept any single character encoding per entity received."

So guess it's not solving the initial question, but might be part of the
solution...?

In theory the data sent by the client should be in one of the 
'acceptable' character sets.  In practice I am sure there are plenty of 
clients which either don't obey this directive or ignore it altogether.

I'm not sure if it might be useful as a way of hinting to modern clients 
that you would like input in utf-8 (or another character set), though I 
believe that most browsers will attempt to provide form data in the same 
character set as the containing page anyway.

Welcome to the World On Rails.

Teach developers not to think, and pretty soon they won't... but they
sure can build a lot of nightmares in a short amount of time.

Anecdotally this has always been the case, but come to think of it I
have no idea if it is required behavior or not.

I can imagine that there might be some mobile browser out there that
returns forms in iso-8859-1 even if the page was rendered utf-8.

Nevertheless, the mainstream browsers can be relied on to submit forms
using the character set with which the page is rendered.

You know you're old when *everyone* thinks that the only IE

As I understand it, all it's doing is establishing what char-sets are 
required for the form.

Not that this is a definitive or totally correct answer, but a 
char-set contain the glyphs for rendering the characters (code 
points) contain within that set.

Like Basic Latin contains the glyphs sufficient to render the code 
points for English (like your email application). If your form is in 
Hebrew, you can't expect the browser to render Hebrew glyphs in the 
form properly unless your browser has that char-set installed or 
knows that's what required.

It's just a way to get everyone in sync with rendering the same glyphs.

I just found another potential gotcha when using Unicode throughout
your application: byte order marks in uploaded text files.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark

Turns out Word puts a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of all
Unicode files. Unicode-friendly tools ignore it. PHP's fgets()
doesn't.

Detecting and stripping the BOM is an interesting exercise, because
strlen('???') == 6, but it's really only 3 bytes long... not sure if
this is a bug or what, but it's certainly an annoyance.

We're thinking about a conference before Memorial Day, but depending on
scheduling I'm not sure that can happen.  If it doesn't happen, then
certainly we'll be doing another NYPHPCon after Labor Day.

Hello,

Personally, I don't like suppressing warnings, even in this case.

I would think, somewhere previously in your code, when you could have 
set $arr['key'] to a value,
you should (maybe) set it to null (0, empty string, etc) when you create 
it, or somewhere else.

I think it is bad practice to not know if an index is set in array.

Anyways, to answer your questions, I'd vote for the first statement you 
provided.

- Ben

ie:

$arr = array( );
...code...
$arr['key'] = ($something == TRUE) ? null : $somethingElse;

or

$arr['key'] == null;

This is preferred - it's actually doing something correct.

This is a hack, which causes an error, which you're then suppressing

Marcus and I discussed a shortcut for the first example at the last Montreal
PHP Conference, but I don't think it's been implemented yet.

Actually I've been using the following function a lot too:

function _array_val($a, $k, $d = null) {
    if (array_key_exists($k, $a))
        return $a[$k];
    if (func_num_args() == 3)
        return $d;
    throw new Exception("No such array key: $k");
}
--8<-- example --8<--
$val = _array_val($arr, 'key', false);

Of course it's a little slower but it makes for clean code.

Hi,

Thanks to all those that took the time to help me. As it turns out my 
problem had nothing to do with PHP; but the way I initialised a MySQL 
interger field.

Oftentimes I like to check for a key value, and then supply a default if 
it is not there.  It can be useful to make up a routine that does this 
for you all in one step:

$rowsPerPage = arraySafe($options,'rowsperpage',25);
$orderLines = arraySafe($orders,'lines',array());

The function is:

function arraySafe($array,$key,$default='') {
  if(isset($array[$key]))
     return $array[$key];
  else
     return $default;
}

Yes, very useful pattern. Handy for grabbing input out of $_GET and
$_POST arrays.

Thanks for your help!

It seems like what I needed was a reboot of the system. The changes I made to php.ini file were applied after I rebooted, so  I'm able to see the errors displayed properly now.

You shouldn't have to reboot. Restarting (or stopping, then starting) 
apache should do the job.

I am actually using IIS in this particular installation. But I guess restarting it would do the job as well?

Though this does get tripped up by $array[$key] being NULL.  
array_key_exists() is more accurate.

Post the URL on many web sites and claim your site has adult content. If it 
makes it through the day I'd call it reliable.

Apache Bench ships with every standard Apache package. For example:

  $ ab -n 1000 -c 3 http://www.example.com/some/script.php

The above command retrieves the supplied URL 1000 times with at most 3
concurrent requests at one time. It's not very comprehensive but it's
great for sanity testing.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Form not working as expected
Message-ID: <1289907876.20080314102115@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello and Warm Greetings,

I have a form that I have been asked to modify and thought it was a
straight forward and simple MOD but it seems to have some a condition
that I didn't count on when I agreed to make the change and I need
some advice.

The situation is that the form (which is using the output buffer)has a
birthday input.

Almost forgot, this is a complex login form that has an IP Address
check in it. If the "expected" IP address is different that the one
stored in the database, it loops back and adds a test for the users
birthdate which does a different database lookup. This one form is
used to manage both conditions.

The form was originally designed to use a text box and the request was
to replace it with a drop down because his users didn't follow the
instructions for formatting most of the time, even with an example
provided. The form does a lookup to see if the birthdate matches the
one that is stored in the database. In the lookup, it compares the
value in $_POST['birthdate'] with the value in the database. The text
box works fine if you enter the correct yyyy-mm-dd format.

The replacement dropdown has three $_POST values very creatively
assigned, $_POST['year'],$_POST['month'],$_POST['day']. To compensate
for the replacement of $_POST['birthdate'] and try to make the change
transparent to the rest of the script I generated it manually in a
hidden field (I actually thought this one WAS creative until I
discovered that it didn't work as I expected, lol),

<input type="hidden"  value="<?=$_POST['year'] . "-" . $_POST['month'] . "-" . $_POST['day'];?>" name="birthdate">

The problem, as you may have already guessed is that
$_POST['birthdate'] gets no date values until AFTER the submit button
and that is too late for it to do its database compare so it fails. If
you rerun the form entry a second time the script works, no problem
but the first time through nada.

I have placed several print_r statements to see what is going on and
the very last I have just after the submit and just after the
ob_get_content and just before the return and $_POST['birthdate'] has
the correct value in it but apparently the script compare function
isn't see it for some reason. If, like I say, I run the input again,
it works fine?

I have tried replacing the $_POST['birthdate'] with a variable
$birthdate that I generate manually with the correct data and pass it
to the diff function but that breaks the script so that it doesn't work
at all no matter how many times you run it. I would really appreciate
someone who might have done something like this and solved it to give
me an idea of where I need to go with it.

Many thanks for your attention,

Try adding this to the top of your script:

if ($POST['year']) {
    $_POST['birthdate']=$_POST['year'].$_POST['month'].$_POST['day'];
}

Correction:

if ($POST['year']) {
   
$_POST['birthdate']=$_POST['year'].'-'.$_POST['month'].'-'.$_POST['day'];
}

Hello Rolan,

Thanks Rolan,

I appreciate the suggestion.

For some reason that variable is not getting updating even with your
suggestion. The print_r results just before the $ret =
ob_get_contents(); are as follows:

Array
(
    [ID] => test
    [Password] => test
    [birth_trial] => 1
    [birthdate] => --
    [year] => 1933
    [month] => 01
    [day] => 01
)

If I enter the input again, it works perfectly. Because it redirects
to another page, it clears the $_POST array so I can't check what was
in it to cause it to work?

Thanks for the idea anyway.

I'd like to be able to split multi-page PDFs into single pages on the server.

My first choice for doing this would be a command-line tool, unless
this is ridiculously easy within PHP using the PDFLib functions... but
those seem more concerned with building documents rather than tearing
them apart...

Anyone know how to do this?

My best experience with this has been using convert (imagemagick) to 
pump them out into individual images.  You have to specify the 
resolution and density, and in the end what you have is images, so that 
even if you pump them back into pdf files, the usual pdf text search 
features wouldn't work.  I hope something better is suggested in this 
thread -- I'd love to see it.

I believe the PDI functions allow you to do that.  You can "import" an existing
PDF or page from a PDF and place it into the doc you're constructing.

I kind of like that approach, actually, despite the non-textiness of
it. It give you the ability to display the pages alongside HTML
content such as annotations and message threads.

Minutes after posting this (isn't this always the way?) I found the
pdftoolkit, for which there is already a Debian package:
http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/

Example command to split a document into pages: pdftk mydoc.pdf burst

Zend_Pdf from Zend Framework can import PDFs. But I've never used it
so I have no idea if it can do what you want or if it's worth using.

Actually this should be easy to do with Zend_pdf. Loading the PDF gives 
you a PHP array of "PDF page" objects. Create another new PDF object and 
then loop through the pages of the already loaded PDF object, adding each 
page to the second object, writing the new PDF out (with appropriate 
filename), then removing the page you just added to make way for the next 
one.

I will let user upload 3 pictures to the backend database first.Then these 3 pictures will be displayed on the web page later.

My question is:
Do I have to setup rules about uploading pictures,like the size,the pixels?I want these 3 pictures to be the same format(size,pixels..) when displayed on internet.So do I need to tell user how pictures should be when they do upload or I program php to change the properties of pictures?Of course,pictures must be visable,not too big or too small, on the web page.

Thanks!

No, picture uploads work the same as any other file uploads and you cannot 
dictate image type, size, pixel depth, or such on the client side using PHP. 
PHP is server side only and by the time PHP has a chance to get hold of the 
image file it is already uploaded.
There are a few checks you can put into place, such as checking for the exif 
headers in jpegs or checking for the magic number, which tells you of what 
type the file is. I once asked about this a long time ago and examples were 
given by fellow NYPHPlers, so you want to search for that in the archives. I 
never got around to implement this, but it is not forgotten.

You can also look for file uploaders that were written using JavaScript or 
Flash, which is both client side code and may accept or reject an image file 
before uploading.

You have options, of course.

As David said in his reply -- to do this in PHP, you'll need to get the 
file onto the server before doing any checking/fixing.

Assuming you're already familiar with php file uploading, you can start 
here: http://www.php.net/gd -- gd is pretty handy.

Read the docs for gd, and decide how to proceed.  The easiest way for 
you to go is to just enforce some rules on the user. Tell the user that 
the files must be (for example) jpeg or png, 300 pixels wide by 300 
pixels tall.  Your form-processing script can inspect the files, and 
either accept them if they meet requirements, or display an error and 
tell the user to try again.

However, there's really no reason you shouldn't help the user out.  If 
you want 300x300 images, there's no reason to reject a 600-pixel-square 
image.  You can use the gd functions to scale it down on the server.

Having done this about a dozen times with different rules, I can warn 
you up front -- give yourself plenty of time to implement this -- and do 
your best to think through your requirements and how to approach 
enforcing them before you start to code.  There are lots of decisions 
you'll need to make.

Hi there:

At the moment, I'm only speculating as to the cause of my problem, but  
I operate an online store, and we have a custom-built cart (which is  
complex, and so could therefore have issues in any number of places  
that I can't explain here), but we've got a new and problematic trend.

The trend is that some of our carts are ending up with information  
missing (inventories of items, specifically)...but the thing is, it  
seems to be happening only to Safari users.  This is a store that's  
been live for almost 4 years, and we've had our share of bugs here and  
there, but generally it's been functioning properly.  This is new, and  
I just am at this point thinking it has something to do with the  
proliferation of Safari 3.x, although I haven't definitively concluded  
this yet.

I should point out that I use OS X, and so Safari is often my primary  
test browser, and I can't actually replicate any of the problems users  
are reporting to us, but it seems that every one that is reporting a  
problem is a Safari user, so there's something fishy going on somewhere.

Is anyone aware of any subtle changes in Safari 3 that could cause  
problems with maintaining sessions or cookies?

Thanks for any insight.

Cheers,

Marc

Have you tested with the "private browsing" feature turned on?

Doesn't seem a likely culprit but maybe some people have it enabled
all the time...

My first thought is that perhaps users are coming to your site with
Private Browsing turned on. Sessions and cookie would then not be
maintained across sessions. Although this should not be a problem as
long as you are creating a new session/cookie after the user logs in.
If Safari is working for you, I tend to think it would be an extra
setting that is enabled. This should be easy enough to test though.

I use Safari on both Mac and Windows and never had a problem with
shopping carts on the big etailers.

Safari has a default cookie policy of "only allow cookies for sites I
navigate to".  As far as I know, this is unique to Safari.  This boils
down to only allowing HTTP cookies to be set by the page in the
address bar.  My guess is that your session cookie ids are getting
created/regenerated on pages with 301/302 redirects or on pages inside
a frame and Safari is rejecting the cookies.

Check the preferences on our test computer and make sure your cookie
policy is set to the default.

Well, is it an Apple Safari or a Windows Safari browser? The Windows version 
is in beta since forever and doesn't seem to get much attention from Apple. 
Maybe you are looking at issues that people have with this half-baked zombie.

Well, dunno if this is going to be very helpful, but Safari tends to chew on
cookies if it crashes...

These issues appear to not be platform-specific.  Because we cater to  
designers and creative types, we have a disproportionately higher  
percentage of Mac users than, say, amazon or eBay probably do.

I've had some of our customers submit info to me, and I can see that  
the browser strings are OS X versions of Safari.

I'm looking into the private browsing thing.  It would be a convenient  
answer, since it's not a feature I use by default, and I'm not seeing  
the problems and other people are, but we'll see.

One other possibility... do you use browser user-agents as part of  
your session security?  And if so, do you have rss feeds?  I found  
that the Safari RSS reader and Mail app share cookies with Safari  
itself but use different user-agent strings.  I had to throw user- 
agents out of the session security equation because of cases like this.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] best practice for detecting ip
Message-ID: <234DCD7F-0E69-499F-A442-8461AA2A8965@beaffinitive.com>

Hey everyone,

Does someone know the best practice for detecting ip addresses with  
php/apache for use in reporting/metrics?

I'm re-evaluating our code for detecting ips and I see it's built  
towards getting a unique browser ip without regard for how easily it  
can be spoofed.  For example, we're using X-FORWARDED-FOR which I know  
can be very easily spoofed by proxy servers so it should only be done  
with trusted proxies like AOL.  Does anyone know where to find a good  
list of ips of trusted proxies (as well as maybe a list of known  
anonymous proxy servers)?

Also, is there any reason to use HTTP_CLIENT_IP?  The current code we  
have looks to use that first if it's available.  But I'm not exactly  
sure the difference between that header and REMOTE_ADDR.

Thanks a lot,
Rob

Hello everybody,

Can anybody help me figure out this error:
Fatal error: SOAP-ERROR: Encoding: External reference 'ref1' in
/var/www/www-trunk/intranet/soap.php on line 21

The only reference I found is on bugs.php.net:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=41566 which says it is fixed in CVS. I tried
the same on both 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 with the same results.

This is a showstopper for a project I'm on so any input will be appreciated.

Thanks.

Crap. Totally unrelated to this thread, but still, crap.

That sounds like a bug / vulnerability to me. Why does Mail.app need
my cookies?

Also, that implies that _any_ app using WebKit for rendering is going
to share cookies, and that should definitely not be the case. Ew.

... and that is exactly what happens, even when using Fluid.app
browsers that are supposed to be isolated from Safari. Session cookies
are not shared (thanks for that) but stored cookies are.

That means most other Mac apps that display HTML, including Dashboard
widgets and newsreaders, share cookies with Safari.

Message-ID: <001301c88a01$6ac98050$0300a8c0@X9183>

Has anybody run across this before?



I am using three different browsers to test the same PHP scripts and MySQL 
database. The application's scripts work by sharing/passing SESSIONS 
variables.



Here is the problem, in one browser (Explorer) all works as expected and the 
session variable named $_SESSION['access'] retains its integrity  However in 
the other two browsers (Firefox & Opera) the $_SESSION['access'] variable is 
corrupted - set to null



It just doesn't make any sense,  this session variable is filled in once 
after user validation and from then on it is a read only session variable, 
why works in one browser and not the others. all three browsers access the 
the same scripts and same database.



I have really racked my brains on this one - Can anybody point me in the 
right direction?



Paul

Most likely a cookies issue.

Are cookies turned on in one browser but not in another?  Configured 
differently?

Since you've said they all access the same scripts, I'll assume that
there is no instances of redirection or function calls based on
browser, then?

Can you pinpoint where it is that you are losing the session var (which page)?

Have you looked at the sites with Live Headers (FF) and Fiddler (IE)
to examine the cookies as Matt suggested?

O'Reilly has their PHP and MySQL training. I have a work sponsored

Paul,
When setting your cookies, try setting all params, including domain & path. I've come across instances similar to yours that were fixed by setting everything.

I have taken both oreilly and zend's courses (not the php one for

Hi!

Does anyone of you know more about IBM servers than I do? I bought two for 
dirt cheap. One is a 325 and it works great. And the other one is a 235 and 
acting a bit up. I bought them as study objects to learn what this server 
stuff is all about, but getting the box to work first is a plus. Feel free to 
contact me off list or not at all.

Thanks in advance,

Perfect timing, I had an idea about the training question.   :)

I'm going off the hopeful assumption that I'm not the only wanna-be
programmer that has a hard time making the leap from reading a book to
production code. One of the things I think would help is a set of 10-15
workbook type exercises that are explained elsewhere. The use of
controlled challenges should help me and hopefully others like me grow
our programming skills.

So my thought would be to coordinate. We pick a PHP book and come up
with a series of workbook type questions for each chapter of the book.
Folks can come to the NYPHP list for deeper explinations. The
"challenge" of the questions can be graduated by the book's intended
audience and by the particular chapter. Later chapters can include
material from the previous chapters, etc.

Does this sound like a reasonable idea and what would the challenges be?

Nothing. However, I wasn't aware the Wiki was restricted to Dev as Hans
didn't mention that in the note.

Attached; pDaemonize() to become a daemon process.  pFork() to fork out
external processes.  There are some other variations that work better in
different environments, but this is good for general purpose stuff.

Well, we've (finally) got a fully functional public demo of Andromeda 
out there:

http://www.andromeda-project.org/demo

It is the start of a basic accounting system, with about a dozen tables 
populated with test data.  Feel free to insert, delete, etc.

The entire app has only 5 source files, and you can view them right 
after logging in.  The largest of course is the bookkeep.dd.yaml file, 
the heart of the whole thing.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] one question about resize the image
Message-ID: <BLU126-W264450FAB62BEDE976A833E8FD0@phx.gbl>


I run php to upload/resize images now.But I have one question:
 
After people upload images, if we want to resize the image,we must maintain the original aspect ratio. This prevents the image from being "stretched" or "squashed".
 
Now people upload two images.And I need to resize these two images
1) "1.jpg" 40*50
2) "2.jpg" 10*20 
 
My thought:(size is height and width here)
"1.jpg" or "2.jpg" will be "stretched" or "squashed" if we keep them as same size.
"1.jpg" and "2.jpg" will maintain the original aspect ratio but different size
 
Is it right?
 
Thanks!
 
chad

I think there is a call to get image stats without loading it into memory.

Hi all, I am new to the list.... I hope I could get some help with a problem
getting mod_proxy working.
I've installed mod_proxy on a debian etch server and enabled it and set my
proxy directives per some how-to doc's... (new to linux) - All seems to have
worked fine until I configured the proxy settting in directives shown below.
And, When I attempt to restart apache I get this error:

Per the error msg reported above, I am not sure what this refers to and

Hi All, Any linux/Apache guru's that can help me with problem below?
I need to be able to get a mod-proxy working.

Some additional info:
The error problem reported in my last email only happens when I enter the
following config statements in my apache Vhost setting in my conf file.

ProxyPass /projects/dc http://h111.MyDomain <http://h111.mydomain/>
ProxyPassReverse /projects/dc http://h111.MyDomain <http://h111.mydomain/>

If I remove or uncomment the above statement apache restarts fine and works
fine. I can load my site and everything seems to work.

What I'm aiming to do is have my proxy service web request to other servers
via the proxy. But, I need to get pass the problem.
I'd be willing to pay someone for help with this.

Joe

Hi Joe,

Completely outside my experience, but some googling turned up this:

Comments #94 and #98 at http://ircarc.com/freenode-apache/368.html#94 
seem to indicate that using ProxyPass inside a directional container 
(like <Directory> or <Location>) causes it to expect only one parameter, 
whereas you're giving it two.  The first parameter is being 
automatically determined based on the value of <Location>.

In the httpd manual I found only one example 
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#envsettings) of 
using ProxyPass inside a <Location> container, and it indeed does use 
only one parameter.

So it seems what you'd want to do is something like this:
        <Directory /projects/dc >
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None

                ProxyPass http://h111.MyDomain
                ProxyPassReverse http://h111.MyDomain

        </Directory>

Also, whether you can even use ProxyPass inside of <Directory> is 
unknown to me, as the only examples I've seen are inside <Location> or 
nothing at all. Remember, what I'm telling you is strictly raw Internet 
research using Google.  I have no idea what I'm actually talking about here.

Is there a performance benefit and way to read just the first few lines
of a 5k-10k file? I'm dealing with 20-300 files at a time. 

Pseudo code would look something like this:

DirectoryIterator  (Thank you PHP CookBook!)
	for each file:
	open file to read
	match $title to stuff between title HTML tags
	put $title into an array based on catagory
	put filename into an array (index matches the $title array)
	close file

Go through the $title arrays in Catagory sequence
	Echo $Catagory
	sort $title array alphabetically
	echo "a href filename" $title "/a"

Hello,

Performance: Yeah, you don't have to hold the entire file in memory. Use 
fopen/fread and iterate through
with a buffer size.

And since you're searching for something specific, you can even just
go line by line using fgets() till you find what you want:

$fp = fopen( $file, r );
while( !feof($fp) ) {
  $line = fgets( $fp );
  if ( strpos( $line, '<title' ) !== FALSE ) {
    break;
  }
}
if ( !feof( $fp ) ) {
  // get title out of $line here
}

Since you're working with big files, it makes sense to build a better
limit into the while loop, to bail out if the title isn't found after
99 lines or something.

Only going to do this once?  Any chance that you'll want to
extract/manipulate data from these files later on?  Would it make
sense to batch load them into a DB and work with them via SQL somehow
so you could work with them later?  Or process in the background?

Thanks,

A ZDNet newsletter today announced, "Sun introduced immediate availability of 7X24 year round global, enterprise-class database subscriptions and services for the entire MySQL product line."

I am wondering if with Sun's emphasis on enterprise-class DB, will there be changes for the non-enterprise users?  Or will there always be open-sourced MySQL available for us non-enterprise users with our "measly" shared, web host accounts?

Hi Allen, thanks for the tips... I was able to get it working but not sure
if the way it is working is the best or right way. Basically, I removed the
virtualhost directives all together and I was able to restart apache. The
proxy seems to be working as well but I am still having some problems and
think it's now with mod-rewrite. But, it looks like I'm getting close.

Thanks,
joe

Sun is Open sourcing al of there software, following this example, I bet
that mysql will continue
being available and in the long it will be open sourced.

I think that the plain simple MySQL that we mainly use will remain available 
at no cost with a favourable license for some time. One never knows what a 
company will do, but I cannot recall anyone ver releasing a product under GPL 
and then taking it proprietary. MySQL is released with two licenses, one is 
the GPL and another one is a 'proprietary' enterprise license so that 
companies can use MySQL in ways that would violate the GPL. AFAIK MySQL and 
now Sun charge for that commercial license and of course for any professional 
support. And I think that is what the announcement aims at. Sun/MySQL try to 
place MySQL in the enterprise as a viable alternative to other (SQL) 
databases, such as MSSQL, DB/2, Oracle and such. I think that is a promising 
endeavour and a nice example where the GPL helps a company to make money by 
not applying the GPL. Quite bizarre!

While no one really knows for sure, all indications, by both Sun and MySQL
(and perhaps last night's meeting), is that MySQL will stay available, and
in fact be improved by Sun's mindshare.

In other similar news, we can't forget about PostgreSQL:

As David pointed out, any MySQL release covered by GPL will be
available forever. MySQL has been playing the dual license game for a
while... if anything, Sun will probably open things even more than
they have been. Pure speculation of course, but momentum at Sun in
recent years has been in favor of freedom.

Why not? We have for years. (ducks)

Commercial support for a database is important for "enterprise" customers -- although my experience with MySQL is that I don't ever need it.

That said,  I've been dragged in the Microsoft world lately and I must say I've been quite impressed with Microsoft's support for SQL Server...  They've been pretty good at solving problems that seem really impossible.  However,  most of the SQL Server problems I've encountered have to do with gimmicky features that cause more trouble than they're worth.

Well, it has been attempted:

http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Apps/sourceforge-forks.html

The above is somewhat biased but largely accurate in its facts.  VA Linux 
had a GPL software product and an Open Source-based business model.  (I 
have a VA Linux t-shirt which says: "Open Source: it's the difference 
between trust and anti-trust.")  The company then did a complete u-turn and 
decided to produce a proprietary product.  (To my knowledge, they never 
produced a t-shirt extolling the virtues of proprietariness and anti-trust 
lawsuits.)  They converted it to a proprietary product, however, by 
definition, the previous code remained free to use indefinitely under the 
GPL.  The community, not entirely happy with this path, maintained and 
upgraded the product, working from the GPL'ed codebase.  VA Software 
(renamed) then faced the interesting business model of selling a 
proprietary product that was competing against virtually the same product, 
GPL'ed and available for free.  It's challenging to sell meatballs when 
someone is giving away the exact same meatballs next door for free.  
Despite pouring quite a lot of money into the effort, this did not work out 
well.  And today, the open source fork remains:

http://gforge.org/

Anyway, the upshot is this...  there are a few questions to ask.

1) Is there a large community interested in the GPL version of this product?
2) Are there sufficient programmers who would work on it and keep it going 
if the primary company abandoned the product?

If the answers to both these questions are "yes", it is essentially 
impossible for a company to successfully take an open source codebase and 
privatize it, no matter how stupid their management may be.  For MySQL, I'd 
say the answers are clearly yes.  So have no fear!  MySQL, or some 
derivative of it, will remain available as long as people care about it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] best practice for detecting ip
Message-ID: <00eb01c88fc3$e93a0eb0$0605a8c0@tank>

 

Hey everyone,

Does someone know the best practice for detecting ip addresses with 
php/apache for use in reporting/metrics?

I'm re-evaluating our code for detecting ips and I see it's built 
towards getting a unique browser ip without regard for how easily it 
can be spoofed.  For example, we're using X-FORWARDED-FOR which I know 
can be very easily spoofed by proxy servers so it should only be done 
with trusted proxies like AOL.  Does anyone know where to find a good 
list of ips of trusted proxies (as well as maybe a list of known 
anonymous proxy servers)?

Also, is there any reason to use HTTP_CLIENT_IP?  The current code we 
have looks to use that first if it's available.  But I'm not exactly 
sure the difference between that header and REMOTE_ADDR.

Thanks a lot,
Rob

Hi Rob,

Yes I assuming you are partly asking this based upon the amount of form spam
and the amount of people using anonymous proxing.

Some RBLs that might be of help
 
Some of the public ones out there (not complete)
http://www.dronebl.org/
http://www.stopforumspam.com/  (which we have converted into a local RBL)
http://rbl.efnetrbl.org/
 
As of previous RBLs were designed to be for only SMTP but as the botnets
progress to web based attacks/spam they are being reused for other proposes.
 
Here is the obligatory PHP code to test RBLs and if a proxy service
 
http://www.jhurliman.org/index.php/2005/open-proxy-rbl-lookups-in-php/
http://w-shadow.com/blog/2007/11/23/detect-users-accessing-your-site-via-a-p
roxy/

There also exists apache plugins to block/redirect to other web pages if on
a specified RBLs
 
Offline I can discuss other things we are developing to help protect our
network by using RBLs
 
RBLs aren't just for SMTP anymore.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] CMS - Estimating Hours
Message-ID: <47EBE498.5010309@nopersonal.info>

Okay, I've got a very general estimating question here.

Here are the basics: The focus of the site will be selling products to
people with autistic children. I'm still waiting for an answer on how
many products there will be in the beginning, so let's just say a dozen
for now. The client wants to be able to maintain the site themselves
(i.e. add new products as the need arises), create a newsletter, and 
also integrate a discussion forum to build a sort of community. 
Accessibility is important for this site (not necessarily the admin 
part, but the public front-end).

This is the list of requirements that I think I'll need to take to
consideration when giving an estimate:

1. Install & configure CMS
2. Design custom templates (I typically spend about 10 hours on this)
3. Code custom templates
4. Find, install & configure shopping cart
   a. Product photos
   b. Product descriptions/details
   c. Pricing
   d. Shipping
   e. Tax
   f. Create/modify shopping cart templates? (Not sure
if this has to be done or if the cart can use CMS templates?)
5. SSL cert (requires static IP)
6. Payment gateway
7. Find, install & configure forum
8. Testing & debugging
9. Training client to use CMS

Did I overlook anything? I've downloaded and am getting ready to install 
both Drupal & Joomla to test drive them, but after much reading I've 
gotten the impression that Drupal is the better overall product in terms 
of code & flexibility.

I know that Joomla has a "prettier" admin interface that the client may 
like better, but I don't want to sacrifice functionality for cosmetics.

Can anyone possibly give me even a ballpark estimate on how many hours 
you think the above might take? I'm assuming they'll also have the 
standard About Us and Contact Us pages.

FYI, a static site that I recently did involved about 65 hours total
(design + coding + content porting + testing + client phone calls,
emails, etc.) for a 17-page site. But I can't really estimate a CMS per
page, so... help!

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Bev

I'll take a stab, BAS:

I noticed that on your numbered list you didn't repeat the need for a 
newsletter. That can take significant time as well. (I've been using 
POMMO as a mailing list manager at work and it's been great.) I would 
say add at least another 10 hours just for that.

I not sure why I'm a bit reluctant to say this, but from what you 
describe (including testing, and even training), I'd say more or less 
250hrs.
That may sound too high for some, but what I'm talking about here is 
solid quality work delivered as promised: firm deadlines (no excuses), 
fully web standards based (may require tweaking the CMS), etc.

It really depends on how much your client has it together as well. Are 
they gonna deliver the content to you in a timely basis. How tech-savvy 
is the staff you are training to run the CMS? Surprisingly, even the 
simple admin interfaces generated by CMSs are enough to scare most folks.

Have a detailed, signed contract before you begin work. Oh, and please 
don't charge less than, say, $60/hr. It wouldn't be fair.

Hope this helps,
-Andre

Well it really depends... do you have experience doing any of this:

4. Find, install & configure shopping cart
  a. Product photos
  b. Product descriptions/details
  c. Pricing
  d. Shipping
  e. Tax
  f. Create/modify shopping cart templates? (Not sure
if this has to be done or if the cart can use CMS templates?)
5. SSL cert (requires static IP)
6. Payment gateway

Because it can be quite a learning experience (adds time) if you
don't. My best suggestion is to find an all-in-one solution or a
developer who has proven experience with these kind of transactions.

3. Code custom templates

I haven't worked with Joomla, but I have worked with Drupal. There is
a bit of a learning curve for following the best practices template
design. I'd suggest getting Pro Drupal Development to help you along
with this.

7. Find, install & configure forum

Drupal can be a forum, see how they use it at groups.drupal.org.

I'd put the work at the very least 80 hours. Any integration that
they'd like to do between the shopping cart and the CMS will add many
hours.

Good points, all. I'd rather overestimate than underestimate.

So true. They were confused by the term "web hosting" so... ;-)

With that in mind, I think I may need to get a better handle on the 
client's expectations.

I never, ever worked without a contract when I was freelancing. 
Thankfully, now that I'm working for someone else I don't have to worry 
about that part, I just have to worry about getting the estimated time 
right. Thanks for the heads-up on the hourly rate though.

> Hope this helps,

It does indeed - thanks a million.

I unfortunately made that mistake once when I was starting to freelance. 
It quickly got really bad...
Now I don't miss an opportunity to pass on this warning to others in 
case it may save someone the headache. :-)

Re the shopping cart, not really. I did install osCommerce once as it 
was available via my cpanel. I set up a few items and played around with 
the shipping & tax stuff, but that was about it.

Re SSL, I've purchased my own SSL certs before, generated the keys, then 
had my hosting company actually install them.

Re payment gateways, It's my understanding that the handling of credit 
card transactions is done via the payment gateway's servers--i.e. if the 
client has a merchant account (or pays for gateway services that provide 
one for a fee), then all I need to be concerned with is that the 
shopping cart can interface securely with the gateway? Please do correct 
me if I'm wrong.

I'll check out how Drupal uses their forum. Thanks for the estimate &

I always try to pass along the warning too. When I was freelancing, 
detailed proposals accompanied by very specific contracts saved me on 
more than one occasion.

Only once did someone out & out try to cheat me, but there were plenty 
of times that clients "forgot" what the scope of a project entailed. 
Having a signed acceptance of proposal & contract on hand immediately 
silenced any disagreements. ;-)

Bev

That is correct, but if the shopping cart doesn't natively support
your gateway, well, then you've got some work to do.

Integration is where you're going to find the biggest headaches,
because then you'll have to get into custom module development for
Drupal, which isn't as bad as it sounds, but it is not something you
should do when you're "on the clock" and haven't tried it yet.

My first suggestion is to find out what is the MINIMUM feature set
your client is willing to launch with. It sounds like they want to
start an e-commerce store + some CMS features, perhaps the best place
to start would be:

http://drupal.org/project/ecommerce

In fact, you'll find there are  TON of well supported modules
available for Drupal, I'd hit up Google (drupal + <feature you're
researching>) before attempting to create anything from stratch.

Hi:

It sounded like in the beginning that you had some experience with a  
static site, and now you're going to build something that's dynamic  
and has a shopping component.

If I had to pass along any advice about this in general, I'd say that  
actually sometimes templating things instead of laying them out  
statically can be quicker, in terms of building.  But when you move  
into dynamic stuff, and especially e-commerce-related stuff, do not  
underestimate the time needed for testing.

You are going to make mistakes.  Lots of them.  And, you'll have  
situations where to get to problem x, you might need to go through  
steps a, b and c to get there, which takes time and is mind-numbingly  
boring.  You don't need to do this kind of stuff on static or simple  
sites.  And when it comes to e-commerce, it has to work; bugs are not  
acceptable because you're dealing with people's private data and all  
that, and customers will get nasty when things don't work right.

(For example, I decided to drop Zen Cart into a project once circa  
2006 or so.  It's basically a steaming pile, as I discovered, but  
that's beside the point. They had an authorize.net module, which it  
turned out after a ton of testing had a bug in it with respect to  
error reporting. This couldn't be ignored; I had to go into the module  
and fix it.  So, if you're using Drupal, and something in Drupal or  
some third-party module doesn't work like it should, you need to be  
prepared to go in there and get your hands dirty if necessary.)

So, budget for testing.  Whatever time you think you'll spend  
building; add on another 200% for the back and forth, the testing, the  
unexpected client requests, etc. and so on.  If you can swing it, pay  
your most anal-retentive friend or perhaps a professional tester some  
money to test things for you; just like it's very hard to edit your  
own writing, it's often very difficult to spot bugs in a system you  
are building, because you naturally tend to fall into certain usage  
patterns that don't test everything.

Oh, and remember to budget for testing.  Did I mention that?

Cheers,

Marc Vose

Specially if there's any kind of time constrain. For example, I am 
building a small payroll application for a client. Unexpected (or 
overlooked) bugs = people don't get paid in time = epic fail.
If one can avoid having to deal with user's sensitive data (credit card, 
etc) by using a third-party service like paypal and avoid the possible 
nightmares, why not do it?

Bingo. That's why CMSs can be more problematic than helpful, specially 
when dealing with clueless clients.

1. CMS vendors promise the world: innumerable "cool" features, "ease of 
use", etc..
2. Client thinks: "wow.. this web stuff is getting so easy. I can have 
my unbelievably complex website done in about a couple of days work!"
3. Developers' work misunderstood and unappreciated.

There was a recent episode of the Boagworld podcast where they go into 
detail with suggestions on how to run a testing session. Well worth a 
listen.

Hi Marc,

Yes, I've got 11 years of experience with static sites and I've even 
done some simple custom CMS work, but I've never tried integrating an 
existing CMS package with a bunch of other stuff. My PHP skills are at 
the lower end of intermediate, so this is going to be a challenge & 
learning experience for me.

Your practical example and advice re testing & other possible gotchas is 
much appreciated (as is your humor). The only other dynamic site I've 
worked with was for a real estate agent. I used Open-Realty and 
modifying the templates was a PITA--it wasn't difficult, just (as you 
mentioned) mind-numbingly boring having to pick through gobs of PHP code 
to find the template bits & HTML, make a change, upload, test, try 
again. Ugh.

Many thanks,
Bev

Exactly.  The operative words here being "unexpected client requests".  
No matter how thoroughly you spec things out and try to anticipate 
everything you will be spending a LOT of time dealing with client 
saying "OH, but I thought the site would do XYZ..." or "OH, but I 
thought that it would be better if we did it like this instead" or just 
plain obnoxious behavior like, "GUESS WHAT, we decided that we need 4 
additional reports of sales activity but we can't extend your 
deadline"...so allow as much extra time as your client will agree to.

Explain to them that by your allowing for a sufficient amount of time 
and careful planning and testing, you are guaranteeing delivery of a 
quality application to them, and you don't want to cut corners in any 
way.

Also make sure to get a percentage of payment up front or within the 
first couple of weeks, that way if things drag out during the client 
approval phase, you won't be left holding 100% of the bag waiting.

And I totally 100% agree, it's nearly impossible to effectively test 
you own code to production-quality perfection, you need to plan to 
bring someone else in on that.

Yeah... that and also things like unique click/impression tracking,  
identifying people creating multiple accounts on sites, etc.  Those  
links were pretty helpful.  It would be nice if there was a whitelist  
maintained of ips for trusted proxies from major ISPs as well.
Thanks,

Bev:

Some of the biggest problems I've had with clients is getting them to 
agree and adhere to a certain layout. Without a solid foundation, 
your site can fall apart very quickly -- especially when your client 
starts to add and change stuff.

I had one client recently who had a front page that had a static six 
item menu on the left and a variable  (0-16 items) "things of 
interest" link list on the right. The client said that he wanted the 
top and bottom of both (the menu and "things of interest") to 
line-up. The client hadn't really thought this out. So, that took 
time for me to explain the problem and I billed for it. This was an 
example of how a client can waste your time if you allow it. Bill for 
everything (including emails explaining things), but deliver what you 
say you will on time, without problems, and clients will respect your 
work and come back.

As for contracts, a letter agreement outlining what is going to be 
done for what money is good to reflect back on for reference. But, if 
you want an iron-clad legal contract so you can take someone to court 
for not paying for a $5k project, then you haven't sued anyone 
before. My last suit cost me $20k over a $10k dispute. IMO, it's not 
worth it. So, get 50% up front and the remainder when done.

If the client won't pay (been stung two times in the last 12 years), 
then just don't work for him again and move on. Simple, but effective.

If you run into problems coding, organize and illustrate the problem 
and drop it on us. Usually someone has been there before. You see, 
doing CMS and dynamic sites are really simple things to accomplish. 
Most of us have done it more than once.

Good luck.

Kristina, thanks for adding to Marc's advice. I'm putting everyone's 
feedback together so I can sort through it, organize it, and use is as a 
guide to try and work my way through this project with as few gotchas as 
  possible.

Though I'm no longer working freelance, I'll advise my employer that it 
would be best to get an up-front payment on this lest it start to drag 
out (which tends to happen even with static sites--it really gets absurd 
sometimes).

Regards,

Hi tedd,

I agree, getting the layout nailed down can be a problem. It seems that 
no matter how many content reviews, mock-ups and wireframes I do, most 
clients can never quite "get it" until they see an actual live site, so 
they usually end up being billed for post-launch changes. With a static 
site using semantic HTML code, well-formed CSS, and includes that's 
usually not a big problem, but I can see how it might get more 
complicated with a template-based CMS.

You're right, I've never had to sue anyone before. When I was 
freelancing I always required a 50% non-refundable up front deposit with 
50% due upon completion (but before delivery), which worked well for me. 
I'm sorry to hear you've been burned in the past, and will keep in mind 
how expensive lawsuits can get should I ever find myself freelancing 
again and feel an urge to let the deposit slide.

As for running into coding problems, I'm pretty persistent when I don't 
understand something and will usually keep working at it until I figure 
things out, but that's when I'm doing my own coding--this first attempt 
at working with a CMS will likely result in me needing assistance at 
some point or other, so it's comforting to know you guys are here if I 
need you!

Regards,
Bev

Bev -- 

Absolutely, especially if you have to answer to both an employer AND 
the client as to the agreed upon amount of time, make sure that you are 
really comfortable with the timeline you agree to.

Also, if you have any programming questions, put them out there now 
rather than later so that you can educate yourself and be able to back 
up your employer's request to justify why it will take the amount of 
time it will take.  

Good luck!  You will learn a lot doing this and have fun too :)

Good advice. As a matter fact, I installed both Drupal & Joomla Thursday 
in the hopes that I can take a good long peek under the hood this 
weekend to see what I'm up against before I submit my estimate to her.

Thanks--I'll probably need all the luck, caffeine, and nicotine I can 
get my hands on!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] is_executable() returns false?
Message-ID: <47EFE21F.4040608@cyberxdesigns.com>

Hi guys and gals,

I have a weird problem with is_executble(), it is returning false when 
it seems like it should return true.  This is on a cpanel server with 
the following:

Apache 1.3.x
PHP 5.2.5
RHE


Here is my test script:

<?php
clearstatcache();

$r = is_executable("curl");  // The offending function.

echo "Is Exec: ";
echo  ($r)? "True":"False";  //Getting printable output.
echo "<br><br>";

exec("curl --version", $output);  // Actually executing it to make sure 
it is there.
print_r($output);
?>

Here is my output:

---- out put to the browser -----

Is Exec: False

Array ( [0] => curl 7.15.3 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.15.3 
OpenSSL/0.9.7a zlib/1.1.4 [1] => Protocols: tftp ftp telnet dict ldap 
http file https ftps [2] => Features: Largefile NTLM SSL libz )

---- end of output ---------------

I am not sure where to go from here.  I wish I didn't have to deal with 
this, but the is_executable function is buried in xcart and I don't want 
to start moding the core.  It seems like I might have some other problem 
that I am just not seeing.

Thanks in advance,
Hans K

I have checked on the Net; But cannot find any solution that uses Includes

The solution was that I needed to modify my open_basedir line in 
http.conf for the virtual host and include /usr/bin.  After I did this 
for http, I struggled with why it wasn't working still reliably.  Dur!  
I also had to make this change in the SSL config for the site.

I think it is amazing that after being completely frustrated and after I 
post to the list, minutes later I find the solution.  Oh well......

Hi Paul,

Please slow down and provide us with some more information.

1.  What is the problem?  Meaning, what is the end result?
Application doesn't work?  Which parts?  Explain the flow of the part
that doesn't work
2. Sounds like you might be moving this application from somewhere
else.  What is different about the architecture of each.  A phpinfo on
each server would go a long way in determining this.
3. Have you narrowed it down to a piece of code?  Can you share that
code with us?

Thanks,

Tom

This happens to me all the time. I start wiriting an email to the list and in 
order to provide as much detail as possible I eventually come across something 
that doesn't look right and find the solution.

JavaScript is client side.  PHP is server side.  This has been discussed 
on this list a couple times, and on the web too many times to count.

You either need to submit the JS data to the server as part of a form or 
via an AJAX request.

I'm going to recommend *against* that. That works, but it's an ugly
hack, and often when you're trying to do something like this you're
not addressing a deeper architectural problem.

To complicate this little ole back to basics essential item.
Here lies crude but doable intermingling of php into js on the fly as a
web page is being created. 
So you are passing php vars to js, you just do all of it 100% in advance
before you even output a single drop 
of final scripts or html. 

...Happy coding.

Pseudo code of sorts follows: 

<?php

turn on output buffering

php does database stuff, push results into master php arrays, create
handy chunks of custom html, whatever...
   $user_name = get_uname();
   $user-status = get_ustat();   
   $allowed_dates_array = get_allowed_date_range();
   $allowed_currences_array = get_allowed_currencies();
   $memeber_types_array = get_allowed_member_types();

echo initial html headers...

//start creating javascript dynamically on the fly,
//creating js arrays, validation script, whatever...  
//using the info and arrays created in pure php above...
   
echo "<script>\n";
echo "var allowed_dates[] = "; 

   for each $allowed_dates_array
	echo $allowed_dates array item . ", \n"
        ... ... ... ...

echo "function validate_dates_with_js(date_to_check){\n"
echo "  if (date_to_check in allowed_dates){ "
echo "   //then do stuff"
echo "   }\n"
echo "}\n"
        ... ... ... ...


//in further html to echo down below create links, drop down lists or
sets of needed check boxes or radio buttons 
//by iterating through the same above master php arrays, e.g.:

echo "<input type=select name=allowed_dates_select
onclick=validate_dates_with_js(this.selected)>\n";
echo "<option> ---- </option>\n";

for each $allowed_dates_array
	echo "<option>".$allowed_dates array item . "</option>\n";

echo "</select>";


//so now the javascript arrays and validation functions generated above
are totally coordinated with 
//the web page html items that need to be validated or linked or
associated in harmony

//You can use the same logic to create custom links, custom
announcements, whatever... that is exactly 
//coordinated to this user, e.g:

echo "<a
href=\"www.websitedatalocker.com?item1=".encrypt_stuff($user_name)."&ite
m2=".encrypt_stuff($user_status).\">Go get your data, ".$user_name."
now!</a>";

turn off output buffering
output all the content created above 

?>

Hi Tom,

Not a problem. Here is the "Capture Client Date Routine" which I "include" 
into the main PHP script.

<?PHP session_start(); ob_start(); ?>
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">

var Days = new
Array('Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday');
var Datum;
var today = new Date();
var Year = takeYear(today);
var Month = leadingZero(today.getMonth()+1);
var DayName = Days[today.getDay()];
var Day = leadingZero(today.getDate());
var Hours = today.getHours();
Hours2 = Hours;
Hours = leadingZero(Hours);
var ampm = "am";
if (Hours2 > 11)
 ampm = "pm";
if (Hours2 > 12)
 Hours2 -= 12;
if (Hours2 == 0) Hours2 = 12;
Hours2 = leadingZero(Hours2);
var Minutes = leadingZero(today.getMinutes());
var Seconds = leadingZero(today.getSeconds());

function takeYear(theDate)
{ x = theDate.getYear();
 var y = x % 100;
 y += (y < 38) ? 2000 : 1900;
 return y; }

function leadingZero(number)
{ if (number < 10) number = "0" + number;
 return number; }

Datum = ( +Year+ '/' +Month+ '/' +Day+ ' - ' +Hours+ ':' +Minutes+ ':'
+Seconds)
document.write (Datum);

$datum = Datum;
document.write ($datum);

</SCRIPT>
<?php echo('  $datum =  ' .  $datum); ?>

It was here I thought by using an include I could overcome the problem with 
transfer of Javascript data to PHP.
Unless there is a simpler way I will have to swat up on AJAX

Paul

Brian:

Ugly is relative and "hacks" are common -- ever use css?

The solution I provided is simple and works.

The point here -- however -- is that Dan said:

>You either need to submit the JS data to the server as part of a form or
>via an AJAX request.

And, I provided a third way. I think there are probably others.

Cheers,

tedd

I'm watching this discussion with interest since I asked a similar question last month (about sending PHP stats from a JS onclick event).  The answer that came up was to put a redirect to the link page, run the PHP script on a redirect.php page and then send it on to the destination.

I've set it up this way and it's working fantastically, but I have tons of links and I'm beginning to feel hesitant about sending users to a redirect when there's so many harmful redirects out there.  (Of course, not mine...)

Just as this question came up here, I was again researching it on the internet, and very clearly saw that the crux of the problem is that Javascript is client side and PHP server side, meaning the 2 don't mix unless in Ajax.

So I'm off to brush up on my Ajax and get it working, because except for the redirect, I can only see that Ajax will work.

Susan hit the nail on the head. She's pointing out why I said it was a
"hack" - if you're not understanding the problem correctly (the
difference between client-side and server-side) then the proposed
solution might be "simple and workable" but it's still wrong.

More to the point, what exactly are your goals with this code, Paul?
Are you just trying to get the exact time on the client's computer?
Are you just trying to create a timestamp in their timezone?
