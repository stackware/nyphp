I don't live in New York, but I have clients there. 

I charge $100 per hour, but I usually do more work than I bill. Besides, I usually work on a pre-project basis.

A decade ago, I was approached by a potential client who asked me for my rate and I replied $50 per hour. To which he said &quot;I never paid more than $25 per hour -- would you consider working for that?&quot; I answered &quot;Sure, but it's going to take me twice as long to get anything done.&quot;

He moved on and a year later; we repeated the conversation; and the outcome. He's probably still looking for someone willing to work for half-wages, but isn't smart enough to realize that you usually get what you pay for, but never more.

Your rate is relative -- charge as you feel you are worth. 

Cheers,

tedd
