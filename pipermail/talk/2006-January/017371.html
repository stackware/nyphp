<PRE>Thanks Chris -
I respond inline below:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sending this header is a courtesy. It doesn't dictate whether you can 
</I>&gt;<i>close the connection - it just provides a means to notify the other party.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It seems to work in some cases - see below.

&gt;<i>In addition, this header is used to alter the default behavior. In 
</I>&gt;<i>HTTP/1.1, keep-alive is the default behavior. In HTTP/1.0, it's not.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I though Connection: close was HTTP/1.1 only, and not HTTP/1.0
I tried adding header(&quot;Cache-Control: no-cache&quot;);  with no luck also.

&gt;&gt;<i>You would use this if you want to execute a redirect and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>continue with a bunch of other code without the client being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>delayed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Remember that you're still just sending an HTTP response. If it has a 
</I>&gt;<i>3xx status code and a Location header, the client will request the new 
</I>&gt;<i>resource, but it can't know about it prior to receiving the original 3xx 
</I>&gt;<i>response.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If I understand you, I think that's ok. There is only one 302/Location sent.

&gt;&gt;<i>If you run the code below you will observe a 30 second delay.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The desired behaviour is that after the the flush(); the client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>moves on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There are a few things to consider. First, you want to be sure that the 
</I>&gt;<i>use of flush() is forcing a chunked response. Use something like 
</I>&gt;<i>LiveHTTPHeaders to verify this. (If you see a Content-Length header, 
</I>&gt;<i>that's problem number one.)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's chunked, no content-length header.

&gt;<i>If you're issuing a chunked response, you want to make sure that the 
</I>&gt;<i>client receives the response line and all of the HTTP headers before 30 
</I>&gt;<i>seconds have passed. After all, it can't redirect before it is asked to.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I used apache ab to verify  with the -v 3 option - the headers are sent 
when I want them to be.
But I do get : &quot;WARNING: Response code not 2xx (302)&quot;
Interestingly wget follows the redirect instantly  - and the rest of the 
code still triggers correctly - so Connection: close isn't ignored by it.
Also, I notice that although I try to force a http/1.0 in apache, if the 
request is 1.1 it send a 1.1 - and also adds a /Content-Type: text/html; 
charset=ISO-8859-1
/after the the Connect: close

&gt;<i>Lastly, you want to be sure that other systems aren't buffering this 
</I>&gt;<i>response and interfering with your plan. If you're using mod_gzip, 
</I>&gt;<i>Apache is likely buffering the response, waiting the full 30 seconds 
</I>&gt;<i>before sending it to the client (compressed). Internet Explorer buffers, 
</I>&gt;<i>so that it doesn't begin to render until it has received a significant 
</I>&gt;<i>portion of the response (making its rendering appear faster, although 
</I>&gt;<i>the overall delivery is actually slower).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Observed in IIS, Apache, Firefox, IE etc, etc. Granted, there's still 
possibly a gotcha in there.

&gt;<i>It's not required that a client abort a transaction as soon as it knows 
</I>&gt;<i>it must request another resource, but these are the major 
</I>&gt;<i>characteristics you want to check to make that scenario possible.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's the problem - it doesn't seem like there is a way to /require/ 
the abort.
