You and the rest of the known universe :)

A dedicated server is a single point of failure, and thus not fault
tolerant.  A double failure (meaning two distinct system-layers fail) is
generally acceptable, even in the most restrictive circumstances.

Well, that's not that far off.  For real fault-tolerance, duplicity is a
must.  This means redundant servers, network routes, and frankly geographic
locations with route awareness.  Fault tolerance (or paranoia) can be quite
high, and expensive.

In terms of the database to use, that's an always interesting discussion.
Depending on the level of fault tolerance you're trying to achieve, it comes
down more to physical concerns, rather than software related, or logical,
ones.  That said, some software can more robustly handle failures in various
layers than others.

&gt;<i> If I could stick this in my basement, the price wouldn't even be so bad.
</I>&gt;<i> But that's not realistic. With a managed service provider, the charge is

Yeah...

&gt;<i> people doing to ensure availability at a reasonable price point?

It's all about the nines, as in five-nines (99.999%).  Depending on the
client, you need to establish a service level agreement that dictates the
availability requirements.

About the nines:  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Nines">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Nines</A>

I've recently completed an engagement with a US military branch, and long
story short, availability is obviously a concern.  At the end of the day,
fault tolerance, and thus the ability to be highly available, comes down to
the combination of multiple layers, ie, software, architecture,
infrastructure, and physical location.  That combination equates to the
number of nines you're willing to commit to, and thus the cost.

So what's a reasonable price point?  Well, for the average eCom site, it
means a backed-up dedicated server that can survive even a total hardware
failure of the server itself.  In the average co-lo environment, this
equates to two or three nines, meaning that you can have the service
restored within 24 hours, and without considerable loss of persistent data.
