<PRE>&gt;<i>I started a site a couple years ago which had a similar problem. 
</I>&gt;<i>Users can create pages and each page had one or many assets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>At first I just did /content/page_id/assets.ext, after I got to 
</I>&gt;<i>32,000 directories, it stopped working. At that point I moved to a 
</I>&gt;<i>system where I had 250 directories like, 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i>Each of those directories had 1000 sub directories in them, each 
</I>&gt;<i>named after the page_id. After I got to around 300,000 sub 
</I>&gt;<i>directories and a little over a million files, I moved to a 
</I>&gt;<i>completely md5 based system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I tried to avoid keeping track of files in the database as it tends 
</I>&gt;<i>to get messy, but I suppose it's inevitable. The benefits of an md5 
</I>&gt;<i>system for me outweigh a non md5 system. This may not be the case 
</I>&gt;<i>for you but the main drawing points to me were:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) Lowered server I/O, there were quite a few duplicated files. Each 
</I>&gt;<i>time two identical files were read, they were pulled from two 
</I>&gt;<i>different spots on the disk. My site quickly grew to using huge 
</I>&gt;<i>amounts of I/O. (around 15,000-20,000 hits a minute on the content 
</I>&gt;<i>server). This definitely helped out for me as some files were 
</I>&gt;<i>duplicated over 1,000 times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2) Made it a lot easier to keep track of what was being used and 
</I>&gt;<i>what wasn't. Without a DB back end I couldn't tell which files I 
</I>&gt;<i>could delete and which I needed to keep without writing a script 
</I>&gt;<i>that basically checked every directory for a matching entry in the 
</I>&gt;<i>database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3) Lowered disk space. Again duplicate files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>4) Allowed me to ban certain images and other files, mass delete 
</I>&gt;<i>things that had a certain md5 attached to it. This is very useful if 
</I>&gt;<i>you will ever need to moderate or have troublesome users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The downside is that you have to make sure your code really keeps 
</I>&gt;<i>track of your file system and you aren't accessing it by hand. 
</I>&gt;<i>Another thing you might worry about using md5 is collisions. If this 
</I>&gt;<i>is a mission critical system, you may want to avoid md5 as it is 
</I>&gt;<i>possible (but somewhat unlikely) you will encounter collisions. I've 
</I>&gt;<i>read anyone with a decent computer can create an md5 collision in 
</I>&gt;<i>about an hour, so that's something to keep in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The way I structured my file system was three levels of single 
</I>&gt;<i>character directories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>/content/a-f0-9/a-f0-9/a-f0-9/filename.ext (4096 directories (16*16*16))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This way I can take any asset md5 and figure out it's location on 
</I>&gt;<i>the file system without database access, and leaves ample room for 
</I>&gt;<i>expansion, as well as moving large (or small) chunks to other 
</I>&gt;<i>servers. At this point I am using this system for over a million 
</I>&gt;<i>files and most of the sub directories only have a few hundred files 
</I>&gt;<i>in them tops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you decided to use a single directory approach you will most 
</I>&gt;<i>likely run into quite a few problems. I remember when I had around 
</I>&gt;<i>15-20,000 files, everything I did in that directory became extra 
</I>&gt;<i>slow. With the setup I'm using now I don't really get any lag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hope that helped.
</I>&gt;<i>-Max
</I>&gt;<i>

This topic is beginning to sound like a problem that a binary tree 
might provide a solution. Anyone have any references for php b-trees?
