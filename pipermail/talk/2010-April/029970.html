<PRE>Lots of entertaining replies. :-)

A security attacker could simply replace the program with something  
else entirely. But I'm getting ahead of myself. If the main concern is  
that someone could break into the hosting site and change the PHP code  
to do something evil, than you could set-up a way to monitor the PHP  
(.php) source code. Do a 'sum' of all the .php and related files.  
Store this away from the PHP directories, and put it in the cron to  
run to do a 'sum' of all the .php files and send an e-mail alert if  
anything has changed along with the 'diff' output. This is assuming  
this monitoring is being done on a production server where development  
of the .php code isn't taking place with constant changes. With this  
scheme, you would be made aware of a change in any PHP code that's on  
the production server, and how it  has been changed. This may reduce  
the fear if wondering if the site has been attacked and if so, what  
might have been changed.

If a program contained the &quot;secret sauce&quot; I think I'd look at writing  
it in something that compiles like &quot;C&quot;. At least there wouldn't be a  
reason to have source code for it of any kind running on a production  
server that's exposed to web attacks.

Hope this helps!
