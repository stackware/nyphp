Subject: Best practice for comparing IP addresses
Message-ID: <0da201c32805$2a6426e0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

Consider the following lines of code:

if ($hasEnteredNick == 1 && file_exists("$pathStart/banned_ips.xml")) {
    $fileID = fopen("$pathStart/banned_ips.xml") or die("Cannot open file $pathStart/banned_ips.xml");
    $stuff = fread($fileID, filesize("$pathStart/banned_ips.xml")); fclose($fileID);
    $parser = xml_parser_create();
    xml_parse_into_struct($parser, $stuff, $bannedIPArray, $extraStuff);
    xml_parser_free($parser);
    $yourIPArray = explode(".", $REMOTE_ADDR);
    for ($i = 0; $i < sizeOf($bannedIPArray); $i++) {
     $ipArray = explode($bannedIPArray[$i][attributes][IP], ".");          
     if (($bannedIPArray[$i][attributes][NICK] === $nick ||
         implode(".", array_pop($yourIPArray)) == implode(".", array_pop($ipArray))
         ) &&
         $bannedIPArray[$i][attributes][NICK] !== "admin"
        ) {
      // NICKNAME FOUND IN banned_ips.xml FILE - THEY HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM CHATROOM
      $hasEnteredNick = 0;
      if ($bannedIPArray[$i][attributes][NICK] === $nick) {
       $errorMsg = "You are using a banned nickname, please select another";
      } else {
       $errorMsg = "The user at this machine ($REMOTE_ADDR) has been banned from the chatroom";
      }
      break;
     }
    }
         
   }

What I want to do is compare an IP address from a parsed XML file with the user's IP address.  If a match is found only in the first three numbers (xx.xx.xx.*) then action is taken.  I thought about using the following algorithm to do so, but does anyone else have a better suggestion?  I am not accustomed to either implode, explode or array_pop, so I am not sure if they are being used properly w/o extensive testing.

Thanx
Phil

Phil,

I gather there are many ways to accomplish this... This is just one that
may work for you...


>From within your for loop...

if(intval($yourIPArray[0].$yourIPArray[1].$yourIPArray[2])==intval($ipAr
ray[0].$ipArray[1].$ipArray[2])){
Do stuff
}

The explode should take your ip address and make it an array with 4
items in it. I think the items will be text. Using the '.' to
concatenate the first three values and intval() to turn them into a
number you should be able to see if they match. 

Of course a regex maybe more robust...

Good luck,
alex

I think you've already found a pretty elegant solution. The only other 
way I can think of to do it would be:

$lastdot= strrpos($ipaddress, ".");
$network= substr($ipaddress, 0, $lastdot);

Or even $network= substr( $ipaddress, 0, strrpos ($ipaddress, ".") ); 
which would displense with the arrays.

This may be a handy function,

Depeneding on the version you're using, you could just use the
$_SESSION['varname'] superglobal... no global keyword required. Just be
careful with it before version 4.3.1 - I had some issues with it on 4.1.2.

One of my websites contains varying changing data; some of it changes

never changes.  Nearly all on the homepage are imported as PHP scripts via
a CGI stub executable.  

I'm interested in a caching solution for the page for efficiency sake. 
Based on this scenario, what would you all recommend I do?

Hi all,

I work for a webhost. Recently we upgraded a few of our servers to PHP 4.3.2
 However, now when a user tries to include a remote file using a full URL.
The following error is generated:

Warning: main(): stream does not support seeking in
/home/username/public_html/file.php on line ##

It does not happen if the file being included is on the same server and is
included using FS. I have not been able to figure out how to avoid it. Any
ideas?

Good morning and Happy Tuesday New Yorkers...
 
I'm working on an application that requires the interface (as well as
the content) to be in English and Chinese.  Unfortunately, I have ZERO
experience in such things.  I have some ideas as how to accomplish this.
OSCommerce does it by including a php language file in their configure
files, which i think seems to be a good way. I also figured maybe
something with XML or from the database (using php / mysql / apache)
 
Can anyone here reccommend an efficient way or something to look at /
for to help me move in the right direction?
 
Thanks!!!

Hi everybody!
I installed Apache 2 (--enable-so) with PHP (--with-gd
--with-oci8 --with-oracle). I also installed Oracle9i.
My problem is that php doesn't work with Oracle9i
properly. It connects once or twice and next time I
open php web page with connection to Oracle it gives
me the error message "Document contains no data" and
"Segmentation fault (11)" in Apache's error log. Does
enybody have the idea what's going on? I'm shure that
the php page works on Apache-PHP-Oracle8i. I think
that php has some problem with connection to Oracle9i.
Was enybody able to get it work with Oracle9i at all?

Thank you all in advance,

Elena

I'm relatively new to this myself. If you can use Unicode instead of one 
of the more specialised encodings, I recommend Tim Bray's intro:
http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/06/Unicode

And also Unicode's FAQ at:
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/

MySQL supports UTF-8, but I haven't been able to determine if that is 
out of the box, or whether you need to compile it 
--with-extra-charsets=complex. Other multibyte character-sets are 
available, see http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Localisation.html

PHP also supports UTF-8. For multibyte character support, see the 
mbstring extension:
http://us3.php.net/mbstring

This is just basic research I've been doing into making sure that the 
apps I design can handle international deployment-- I have yet to 
actually deal with real world data in anything other than ISO-8859-1. 
And your client probably has a specific character-set they want to 
support, which might make it easier to find a solution.

I did some tests with set_error_handler and realize the error does not come
up the chain ... how would an example like this translate (from Java to
PHP):

try {
    queryPoll(); // does SQL and *may* timeout
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Sorry, the poll was not available.");
}

I was thinking this would do it in PHP:

    error_reporting(0);
    set_error_handler("handle_error");
    include("poll.php");

    function handle_error ($errno, $errmsg, $filename, $linenum, $vars) {
        if ($filename == "poll.php") { echo "Sorry, the poll was not
available."; }
    }

I don't think Im understanding error reporting correctly.

There are mainly two sets of Chinese characters. One is GB2312
system, another is Big5 system. GB2312 is mainly used by
MainLand China, Big5 is mainly used by Chinese overseas, Taiwan,
Hongkong. so you need to make decision where is your marketplace
and which one is suitable, or you want to handle them all. But I
guess you need both, since more more Mainland Chinese people are
come to aboard, it will be very soon to become the majority of
Chinese overseas. IE can handle both Chinese character sets, for
Netscape you may need a third party encoding software to handle
the display, but those are free. Here is one you may use:
http://www.njstar.com .
Msql database has no problem to handle chinese Character. 
There are two ways to handle those two Chinese Character sets.
1)Dynamic interface handling,
you may need a convert program to convert those Char sets each
other, there are some programs are free to download, but I don't
know where. Usually it is perl or c++ program.
2)Static web contents.
This is the easy one, you can prepare two sets of your web
contents, and disply them seperately. So totally will be three
sets of them, 2 Chinese and 1 English. There is the way
OSCommerce handles multiple languages.

Hope it may help little bit!

see http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php for more info on how to
catch errors.

also you can add the at sign "@" before the function call.
do this (copied from http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php)

$success = @include($yourinclude);
if (!$success) { print "Can't find page $yourinclude"; }

Subject: Big MySQL Problem
Message-ID: <20030604075036.A28655@turing.matcmp.ncc.edu>

Folks:
I'm not quite sure what to do about this one.  Hopefully you guys can
help.

MySQL on my server is running at 99% CPU, as reported by top.
Anything that tries to access it (my web site, mysqldump, mysqladmin)
waits forever.  I rebooted the server, and MySQL is still eating up
the CPU.  I only found one log file in /usr/local/mysql/var, and it's
dated from 2002.  How can I figure out what's wrong, fix the problem,
and or restart MySQL so that it will work properly?

TIA,
-Chris

Try to download a sniffer (www.ethereal.com) and see if there is anything
else going on with your MySQL port.  Otherwise try the MySQL list to see if
someone with the same config is having the same problem.

RedHat assuming, and installed via RPMs?

If you've installed from RPM and/or source/binary packages from mysql.com you
might be running multiple instances.  I think that MySQL generally installs
to /usr/* from RPM and /usr/local/ from binary/source.  Look for a
/etc/init.d/mysql.server or similar file in /usr/local/etc.  Then, something
like mysql.server stop should shut it down, and using the appropiate my.cnf
(which should also be in /etc) you could disable certain aspects of it (like
disable the TCP listener) and turn on extensive logging, pointing to a know
location.

Not sure how to tell if there are multiple instances or not.  It's
built from source on an OpenBSD 2.8 system.

Ahh, good ol' OBSD.  You probably don't have multiple instances then, unless
you compiled from source multiple times  :)

Hmm.  Does MySQL enter this neverending spin state just when it starts, or
only after a query is run against it?  Perhaps just a bad query somewhere?

Nope.  :)  I should mention that the entire system has been running
just fine, and then I noticed this last night.  It *could* be due to
some kind of badness in my web site, since I made the redesign live
late last week, but you'd figure I would have caught that before now.
As far as I remember (and I'll get the fine-toothed comb out soon),
everything's in a require_once.  It might be a bad query, but off the
top of my head I can't think of what that would be.

I will reboot again, and rename my web directory, to see if it comes
up normally.  That ought to narrow things down a bit.

And, so far, it's running just fine.  Damn, I guess it really *is*

I think there may be some issues with 9i.  Maybe this thread is useful:

I haven't worked with 9i yet, but I think it's generally recommended to
compile PHP --enable-sigchild.  Also, if you're using persistent connections,
use non-persistent connections and see if that helps at all.  Granted, you
may need persistent connections, but it may be possible to get around it:

The only thing, could be thread related:

Which would be a bit harder to track down and deal with  :)

PHP 4.3.1 (with no extentions) on it with no problems, and now I need to load 
the php_oic8.dll extention. I have done this on other windows machines without 
a problem, but this one seems to be a bit different. I installed the oracle 
8.1.7 client on the machine, uncommented out the extention in the php.ini file, 
and set the extention directory path. Now if a page is called that contains one 
of the oci8 functions, it just displays a blank white page. After some 
reasearch, I have realized that the webserver is using the 9i OCI.dll that is 
associated with the 9iAS's %ORACLE_HOME% . Is there a way to hardcode in which %
ORACLE_HOME% you want php to use?

Hmm, looks ok.  Just rewriting so I see things clearer:

$query = "SELECT *
            FROM advlistings, valsec, valprim
           WHERE advlistings.advId=$advId
             AND valsec.SecID=advlistings.secId
             AND valprim.primeId=valsec.primeID";

Do you have multiple MySQL links open?  Perhaps case-sensitivity is an issue?
 It's always a good idea to specify the MySQL link resource in mysql_query()
IMO.

Why are you using different capitalization on field names?

   SecID is not the same as secId
   primeId is not the same as primeID

If you retyped this rather than cutting/pasting your code, you just proved 
why it's important to use the actual code.

If you did use the actual code here, did you mistype the cases of field
names in your query?

If those are the actual field name cases in the table structures, you 
really should make your life easier in the long run and come up with a 
field naming convention.

Thanks to Hans and Dan for responding in my time of blindness. Yes, it was a
misspelling and I do have to conform the variable names that I used at
differnt times.

like CPanel?

There are a few alternatives, but IMO, CPanel is the best of all evils.  It is
not perfect, nor cheap, but it does a better job at shared hosting than
everything else I've used (from a admin and end-user perspective).

Some of the others off the top of my head:
    web://cp (Open Source) http://webcp.can-host.com/
    Webmin (Open Source) http://www.webmin.com/
    Plesk (Commercial) http://www.plesk.com/
    H-Sphere (Commercial) http://www.psoft.net/
    Ensim (Commercial) http://www.ensim.com/

As far as roll-your-own, the general idea is that you are automating
system-administration tasks with a web-based GUI, so I'd imagine books like
"Perl for System Administration" (O'Reilly) would be of use.

Hello there,

I posted on my blog a little function that will translate accented

I though that it might be helpful for someone else than me.

Hello,

Not sure what is the problem you are referring to, but I checked in 
Safari (OS X), Phoenix (Win 2000) and IE 6 (Win 2000) and everything 
looks good to me.

But this post doesn't display well in Radio UserLand (OS X) and 
NetNewsWire (OS X) which are RSS readers.

Cool.  So, now we can send you some JavaScript to perform some cross site 
scripting vulnerabilities!

Which web mailer are you using?  It should be reported:

Hi,
I'm using Mozilla's mail reader, and it renders in HTML.  Thus, it 
rendered any HTML tags in your email as such.

I'm using Mozilla's mail program.
Is there a way to force plain text?

I disabled Javascript for mail (at least I think so), so you can't send 
such things to me.
But it still renders HTML tags.

Waittaminit-- I use Mozilla Mail and I saw the tags just fine-- what 
version are you using?

The messages from nyphp-talk always display as plain text for me, in 
fact, they don't *have* an HTML part.
Is this a Mailman setting, Hans?

I'm sorry.  Doh!
I was referring to the webmail interface to my POP3 mail account.
Mozilla mail is FINE.  No EXPLOITS in Mozilla!

Hi all, have any of you had to add the "t1lib" to use with the GD library on Win32 using IIS?

I am having the worse time trying to find information on this.

Do we need to recompile GD?
Or PHP?

Any clues are very appreciated, thanks.

This seems to be an intermittent problem...not sure if it's a code
issue, configuration issue, or browser issue (or all of the above??).

On the site I'm building, a user clicks on a link which sends them to a
secure page. Sometimes a message pops up saying that there are secure
and insecure items. I'm not sure what could be causing it? Could it be,
perhaps, that there is no cert for the site?

Sounds like their browser is just alerting them that they are about to moved
to a secured connection, or to an insecure connection. They should have an
option to turn that warning off in their browser.

Jeff,

The most likely cause for this is images, CSS, or JavaScript files that are 
referenced absolutely, e.g., hardcoded by using "http://" or in some cases 
even "/img/some.gif"

A solution is to use "//img/some.gif" to maintain protocol state (https://)

 In my experience, it usually happens when a secure page is including
content via regular (in secure) URLs. Prime example would be banners or
other images/css/js with absolute URL.

Check to see if you any such thing happening in your page.

Kushner,

I had never used the syntax prior to my current job, but it is apparently a 
long standing spec in HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1.  My experience is limited in 
its use and quirks, but it seems to work for the browsers we support: IE 5+, 
Mozilla, Netscape 4-7 (View source of http://www.ibm.com/ to see how it's 
implemented)

Essentially what this syntax allows you to do is specfiy a an absolute path 
to a resource on a different hostname, but force the protocol to remain the 
same.

So, if your images are hosted on a separate server, you could link to them 
securely from your standard file web server like so:

On http://server.ibm.com/index.jsp:
   img src="//images.ibm.com/some.gif"
   img src="//img/some.gif"

Following is some cryptic info on the spec, but which seems to prove that 
it's been around a while:


http://web.access.net.au/felixadv/files/output/book/x3288.html
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2068/rfc2068.txt

3.2.1 General Syntax

   URIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some
   known base URI, depending upon the context of their use. The two
   forms are differentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always begin
   with a scheme name followed by a colon.

          URI            = ( absoluteURI | relativeURI ) [ "#" fragment ]

          absoluteURI    = scheme ":" *( uchar | reserved )

          relativeURI    = net_path | abs_path | rel_path

          net_path       = "//" net_loc [ abs_path ]
          abs_path       = "/" rel_path
          rel_path       = [ path ] [ ";" params ] [ "?" query ]

          path           = fsegment *( "/" segment )
          fsegment       = 1*pchar
          segment        = *pchar

          params         = param *( ";" param )
          param          = *( pchar | "/" )

It's more than likely the being caused by *all* of the items mentioned -
stylesheets, images, javascript.

Looks like this may now be one of *my* pet peeves. :)

Don't use a relative path. Hardcode everything with the absolute URL, i.e.
https://... etc.

I know that the way our files are setup; all of the files (secure and
unsecure) are in the same directory. However, to use them for a secure
page, I have to call the files through a secure server using absolute
URLS. If I forget an element and leave it relative, i.e. javascript
include, then I receive those "some items are insecure" messages.

Deidra,

The only "issue" I have with that is that the page in question is part
of a set of DreamWeaver templates so...if my client decides to change
the template then this particular page would have to be changed by hand.
However, if this is the only way to eliminate the problem...so be it.

Thank you and everyone for your speedy replies.

Jeff

As a follow up, this syntax is most usefull when you are using shared HTML 
templates for both http and https sessions.

For example, if you use the same page for general users but also change 
protocol when registered users log in, you avoid the pitfalls of having to 
hard code "https" or "http" in the links.

Jeff,

Can you call these files dynamically and tell PHP to add 'http://' or 
'https://' when required?

This what I have done in another project (not a PHP project) a while 
ago and it was working well for me. In the session, I had set a value 
telling me if I was on a secure page, and then switched from:

http://www.myserver.com/style.css

to:

https://www.myserver.com/style.css

HTH

Cheers

turn on that warning by tools-> internet options -> security tab -> Custom

carlos,
there is a pretty good detail in http://us3.php.net/install.windows
what version of php are you using? there were some recent changes
according to the php extension chart
php_gd.dll;  GD library image functions; Removed in PHP 4.3.2

looks like the replacement is php_gd2.dll

good luck with this

I'd love to be able to do it but...at this stage it ain't that easy.
Because the website needed to be "update-able" by the client (who uses
DreamWeaver) I had to work with the DreamWeaver template concept.
However, since there are about 80 search-engine optimized pages that all
required fixed paths, etc., adding one additional page to their task
list of pages to update (in the event of a template change) probably
won't kill them.

Hi deedee, thanks. Yes we have read that. But have also heard that there is a way to do it without Visual Basic, using CygWin or other interpreter. 

Now GD2 only supports FreeType2, which is supposed to be pretty good but not as good as postscript using t1lib. Even with PHP 4.3.2 installed I am not being able to do the anti-aliasing of GD2, so just went for the t1lib.

We are now installing it on the Linux box and see if we can use a cross-compiler to compile a Win32 version from there.

Thanks for your help. Any more clues people??? Please  :)

Carlos

Subject: Crypt issue??
Message-ID: <006601c32c73$c42ef9e0$6501a8c0@EZDSDELL>

Not sure how to handle this one.


I have a simple function using crypt for storing passwords:

	function EncryptString($strToEncrypt){
		$tmp = crypt(trim($strToEncrypt),"MYSALT"); //One way
encryption
		return $tmp;
	}


When a user creates a new password it returns one value. When a user
tries to log in (and I call this function again) it returns a different
value yet...if I edit the user's record using one of my forms, THEN
everything works fine (that is, then the user can log in).

What seems to be happening is that when adding a new record crypt
returns a different value than when I'm editing that record. This
doesn't really make sense.

It's probably a code issue but I can't see any differences in the way
I'm calling the function.
When it encodes the password '12345' when adding the record it generates
"WOjDi2e3GGR4U"
But when I test the login function it generates "WOxvmVFSIQUTU"

In both cases I'm using this to call the function:
$tmpPwd = EncryptString($_POST['DU_sPwd']);

Any clues?

Jeff

Of course I solved the problem...sometimes the very act of writing and
sending that email helps you find the solution. The "solution" of
course, is so embarrassing...well...I'll tell ya anyway.

The post var is called "DU_sPwd" but in the form the element was named
DL_sPwd. I realized this as soon as I did the following: echo 'pwd' .
$_POST['DU_sPwd']; and it came back with nothing!

So...do I thank everyone on the list or do I thank myself?? ;)

I noticed in the table 'users' on mysql windows version '3.23.49-max-debug'
that besides 'localhost' there is also a '%' host.

mysql> select Host, User,Password from user;
+-----------+------+------------------+
| Host      | User | Password         |
+-----------+------+------------------+
| localhost | root | 7a29160226fc5443 |

| %         |      |                  |
+-----------+------+------------------+
3 rows in set (0.04 sec)


  What is Host '%'? When I try logging on I get:

C:\\>mysqlc -h %
ERROR 2005: Unknown MySQL Server Host (%) (1)

Do you know why the mysql windows version creates host '%' in the user
table?

Is this user creation and login procedures contained in the same script?

If not, is the EncryptString() function EXACTLY the same in each script, 
including the same salt?

You might want to simplify things by using md5().

Anyway, put an echo statement inside the function:
   echo "&gt;$stringtoencrypt&lt;";
and see if the actual input is the same.  Perhaps something is modifying 
your input before it gets submitted to the function.

Enjoy,

"%" is a wildcard.  So the second record says root can log in from 
anywhere without a password and the third record means anonymous access is 
granted from anywhere.  Not too secure.

Peter,
The 'Host' column in the 'user' table contains the *client* hosts from which corresponding users are allowed to connect to your MySQL server.
The '%' character is a SQL wildcard.  It matches any string, including empty string.
Go to http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Connection_access.html
and http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/String_syntax.html#IDX968 for more info.

I just realized that I did not really answer your questions.

>  What is Host '%'?
It means "from any host".

> Do you know why the mysql windows version creates host '%' in the user
> table?

All versions do that.


> When I try logging on I get:

> ERROR 2005: Unknown MySQL Server Host (%) (1)

'%' does not identify any specific host. Use 'localhost' if you are connecting from the same machine.

Thanks for your input but as I noted in a subsequent post
(actually...the answer came to me 30 seconds after shooting out the
email)....it was really a darned typo that caused the error!
I did exactly as you suggested...put in an echo statement...that's when
the light bulb went off (or was it the dope slap?).

What's the advantage of MD5 vis-a-vis crypt?

Is this user creation and login procedures contained in the same script?

If not, is the EncryptString() function EXACTLY the same in each script,

including the same salt?

You might want to simplify things by using md5().

Anyway, put an echo statement inside the function:
   echo "&gt;$stringtoencrypt&lt;";
and see if the actual input is the same.  Perhaps something is modifying

your input before it gets submitted to the function.

Enjoy,

Subject: problem with count() function
Message-ID: <016001c32ca0$ecb54cc0$f90708d8@default>

I noticed when using count() on an array fetched from a mysql db, it returns
twice the amount of elements in the array.

For instance:
<?
$stmt = "SELECT element1,element2,element3,element4,element5 FROM $table";
$sth = mysql_query($stmt, $dbh);

$row = mysql_fetch_array($sth);

$Count = count($count);
?>

$Count will equal 10 instead of 5. Has anyone else noticed this behaviour?

That's cause mysql_fetch_array creates both indexed (numeric) and 
associative (column names) keys -- so for every column in your result 
set there are actually two keys-- do print_r($row) to see this.

Take a look at mysql_fetch_assoc() in the manual, too, it might be what 
you want.

Instead of the count, you may want to run a mysql_num_rows right after
the query is run, which will return the size of the returned array
regardless of MYSQL_ASSOC, MYSQL_NUM, or  MYSQL_BOTH (fetch_array types)

Excerpt from http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-num-rows.php
------------
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM table1", $link);
$num_rows = mysql_num_rows($result);

Hi everyone

There is much to catch up. What great CMS projects you have been doing
lately.

Steve Bond and I attended the OSCOM in Bostom and it turned out great.
Jona and Scott from AbstractEdge were there as well.

Sandro Zic was one of speakers at OSCOM and gave a talk there on Sematic
web. He will give a talk at eGenius office.

The Users group meeting will be on the 12th, coming Thursday at Superfine,
Brooklyn on Front street right under the Manhattan bridge.

4 PM 	Sandro Zic (ZZOSS), a speaker at OSCOM,
        Semantic web and CMS, please note this can change.

5 PM    CMS Users Group at Superfine

For more information, call egenius at 718.858.0142 or
http://www.egenius.com/contact

Let us know by sending email at contact at egenius.com for
Sandro so that we know how many people are coming. Thanks

We are going to take advantage of Superfine's happy hour till 6 PM. Good
brew for cheap and fine food.

We invite zopers, phpistas, cms builders, cms seekers, cms enlightenment
to come and join us.

eGenius - located in dumbo, a historical part of Brooklyn next to the
water front. One can get here by taking F train to York. Make right on Jay
(downhill to 20 Jay Street, ABC Carpet is here), elevator to 10th floor,
make right to Suite 1002. Or you can take A or C train to High. It is
tricky. Walk down to Front street towards water, right on Front, left on
Jay. Give me a call if you get lost.

Superfine - located in dumbo, nice and spacious cafe, Front street, right
under Manhattan bridge, Just two blocks up from eGenius office. Happy hour

More fool proof.  You might mistakenly use different salts.  Or you might 
use different algorithm types.  Also, moving to different computer can 
change the algorithm, thus altering output.  Then, only the first eight 
characters of input are used, throwing away the value of long passwords.  
Finally, it seems due to the length of the output, md5 is better at 
producing unique results.

Message-ID: <29950-220036671819421@M2W093.mail2web.com>

I could use a hand with a TCL-related problem I'm having on my site!

I have a list as follows:

id 1 pollID 1 question {How are you?} answerID 1 answer {I'm fine, thanx}
id 2 pollID 1 question {How are you?} answerID 2 answer {OK} id 3 pollID 1
question {How are you?} answerID 3 answer {Leave me alone, life sucks!} id
4 pollID 2 question {Do you think there should be a TCL certification exam
in Brainbench?} answerID 1 answer {Yes} id 5 pollID 2 question {Do you
think there should be a TCL certification exam in Brainbench?} answerID 2
answer {No}


I am going to edit this list by doing a change to a part of the
question/answer set in, say, pollID 2.  I want to them go to the first
instance of "pollID 2" and not have to loop as this list can become
extremely large (on my live site the XML file that this list is derived
from has an id range that goes to 1000!).

How then do I use [lsearch] based on this pattern? "pollID $pollID"?
[lsearch] fails every combination I tried (returns -1), while [string
first] finds it, however, the index is completely wrong for the list
functions.

Advice?

Thanx
Phil

Your problem is that pollID and 2 are each elements of your list.  If
you want them to be treated as one element, you need to quote them.
lsearch only searches individual elements.  If you want to find the
particular element of the list that precedes the numeral "2", you'll
have to loop over the elements.  Perhaps you would be better off
quoting the two strings to create one element, e.g. "pollID 2", when
you create the list, instead of when you search it.

More fool proof.  You might mistakenly use different salts.  Or you
might 
use different algorithm types.  Also, moving to different computer can 
change the algorithm, thus altering output.  Then, only the first eight 
characters of input are used, throwing away the value of long passwords.

Finally, it seems due to the length of the output, md5 is better at 
producing unique results.

Thanx for your solution.  Now I have to face another issue.  The "pollID
$pollID" elements that were joined together into one element in the same
list now have to be broken apart within the same list.  How do I do that
too?

I'm not sure what you mean.  If you mean you want to create a list
where the same element will somehow act both as one element made up of
two pieces and also will sometimes act as two separate elements, you
can't do that.  If you want to put in three elements, you can do that.
For example, here's the Tcl to create a list with three such elements:

set pollID 15
set lstVar [list "pollID $pollID" pollID $pollID]

Now you have a list of three elements.  The first one is:

pollID 15

The second one is:

pollID

The third one is:

15

I think this is what you are talking about because, as you asked you
have the elements "joined together" and "broken apart within the same
list".

If you are saying you need a reliable way to split the elements
*after* you read them out of the list, you can do it like this:

set pollID 15
set lstVar [list thing1 thing2 "something borrowed" "something blue" "pollID $pollID"]
set numPollid [lsearch $lstVar "pollID $pollID"]
set lstPieces [split [lindex $lstVar $numPollid] { }]

In this example, first I created a list with the following five strings as
its elements:

thing1
thing2 
something borrowed
something blue
pollID 15

Then I found the index of the pollid entry, extracted that entry and
split it up on its internal space using the "split" command.  

You now have a list variable, called lstPieces, that contains the
split up pieces of the "pollID 15" element.  It contains two elements,
numbered 0 and 1.  Element # 0 of this small list is the string
"pollID" and element # 1 is the number 15.

We're sort of getting into the nitty-gritty of introductory Tcl here,
so if this is bugging anyone, just drop me a line and I'll refrain
from further off-topic emails via the list.

HTH,
James

I'd recommend using absolute quoting (braces) instead of double
quotes when you build your list in the first place. Braces are
technically the sub-list operator.

-------------
% set list {{id 1} {pollID 1} {question {How are you?}} {answerID 1} {answer {I'm fine, thanx}} }
{id 1} {pollID 1} {question {How are you?}} {answerID 1} {answer {I'm fine, thanx}}
% lindex $list 0
id 1
% lindex $list 1
pollID 1
% lindex [lindex $list 1] 1
1
% lrange $list 0 1
{id 1} {pollID 1}
% lindex [lrange $list 0 1] 0
id 1
-------------

Does that answer your question?

The one thing to remember about doing that is that braces don't do
variable expansion, so in the case where the value of variable $pollID
is 2, {pollID $pollID} expands to a string "pollID $pollID", whereas
"pollID $pollID" expands to "pollID 2".  I noticed that in some cases
Phil was relying on variable expansion.

Four separate messages (two identical pairs) were sent to the list; once on
Saturday, and once today (notice today's have the added [cms-list] in the
subject).

Chalu, when sending informational posts to the list, please be sure you get
the message written properly the first time, as to avoid this unneeded
traffic.  Or, better still, informational posts regarding group
activities/meetings should not be sent across Talk at all.  Such posts should
be sent to listmaster at nyphp.org or myself for distribution on the Announce
list.

Thanks,

H

Ok here's a good question:

Has anyone upgraded from php 4.3.0 to 4.3.2 on
win32 using Apache 2? Did they change in the
apache 2 sapi handler for php cause any problems.
I'm now getting a few weird issues on my server.
The first being that certain programs now don't
work (like Gallery) and I get random PHP warnings
even with warnings & errors turned off. 

Also, some php pages appear randomly with no
content while hitting refresh fixes the problem.
If I switch back to php 4.3.0 all these problems
go away. So, with that in mind what could be
causing these problems? Any ideas?

I'm not entirely sure, but a possibility could be that php 4.3.2 is still in
the experimental stages with apache 2, trying switching back to an older
version of apache and see what happens.

What do you want to know?  I used to build an appliance based on this
open-source tool.  The problem with ACID is that it is very slow especially
with the type of network traffic that I was dealing with.  Since it works
with both MySQL and Postgres + PHP, you can really go crazy with it.  It's a
nice light weight IDS.  You can repurpose your old PII 200 box. :)

No, but gosh it looks like fun. I used to run portsentry and logcheck on 
a DMZ host and watch the nearly constant barrage of portscans trying to 
discover open IIS and SqlServer ports.

Snort looks like it's a bit more industrial strength (and CPU 
intensive). Unfortunately portsentry seems to have disappeared into the 
gaping maw of Cisco Systems.

Message-ID: <3EE53991.3D469262@alum.rpi.edu>

Was php 4.3.0 considered experimental as well? It
seems pretty stable to me if was. Anyhow, yeah,
when I switch back to 4.3.0 from 4.3.2 all these
problems go away. I can't switch to another
version of apache at this moment since this is on
a production server (apache 2 seems better than
apache 1.3x on windows) and I can't leave
customers in the dark. It's hard enough trying to
restart apache and configuring in short bursts of
time so that I don't disturb customer sites.

You need to run the sort functions on the level of the array you're 
looking to traverse.  So, the two following examples sort different 
things:
   asort($row[#]['empname']['dept']['ssn']);
   asort($row[#]['empname']['dept']);

Without fully understanding what you're trying to do, it seems you're off
track storing all this stuff in one very multidimensional array.

If you want further tips, clarify exactly what data you're trying to 
manipulate, including examples of such data.

Enjoy,

On a somewhat similar note, I had begun work on an extension to
form/send/recv raw packets, but it's been on the back burner for some time. 
I guess it could be used to wreak havoc on an IDS  :)

At work I'm just completing a couple ncurses apps in PHP - were you
considering something console based, or strictly web related?

*sigh*

Like sendmail, I think we need to start a "Don't Blame PHP" campaign.  All
except one of these issues is application related - not PHP itself.  Yet,
when talking with "outsiders" about PHP, a common theme is insecurity.

array_multisort() is probably closest to what you want, but even that isn't
*really* what you want since it sorts the columns left to right.  You may try
something like:

array_multisort($row['empname']);

To do exactly what you want, I'd highly recommend using a database - SQL's
ORDER BY is great, and probably faster in the long run :)

Otherwise, consider breaking the multidimensional array into montholithic
arrays, which may make them easier to work with, including use in
array_multisort().  Typically, hugely multidimensional arrays bring more
confusion than anything else :)

The blessing and curse of the language is how easy it is for a relative

without knowing or caring about all the different ways that somebody 
could come along and abuse it. The fact that most PHP code operates in a

Look at it this way-- peer review has just upgraded security on seven 
different PHP projects! Maybe NYPHP should have review team that pokes 
at member-submitted apps and checks for things like unescaped UIDs from 
cookies and cross-site-scripting opportunities.

Thanks for posting that summary, Dan!

Is anybody on the list using mod_security? Thoughts? Performance?
http://www.modsecurity.org

It allows you to filter get and post requests before they are handed off 
to scripts. I wonder if it will do cookies as well?

It looks like an excellent way to add an extra layer of security to 
anything that's being run via Apache. In the latest version you can 
apparently chroot the environment in which scripts are run:

I haven't used it first hand, but I'd be happy to share my thoughts on it
anyway  :)  It looks nice and well written, but I'm always biased against
mod_something that depends on a series of regex rules - although it does look
better than mod_rewrite.

>From looking at the functionality it provides, I can't see that it would
offer much protection to a well written application.  Sure, you can filter
"INSERT" and "DELETE FROM" out of requests, but if the application is
susecptible to that type of thing anyway, there's more trouble than
mod_security can fix.  Just seems like a patchy way of doing things (akin to
mod_rewrite).  But, this directive looks nice:

SecFilterByteRange 65 122

Assuming mod_security doesn't have any security issues/overflows itself :)

Hmm... good question.  Theoretically, it should work.  If Cygwin has a
coherent implementation of ncurses, that is.

Honestly, I ditched the bundled ncurses extension and wrote my own.  After
examining it, I realized that the functions were returning all sorts of
different types, and there was just general inconsistency.  Plus, there was a
lot of stuff I didn't need (pads,menus,etc) that just added complexitity. 
After the rewrite, I wrapped it in a class so I can do stuff like $mywindow =
new Window('Title');  Hey, just like MFC!  :)  I'm going to be submitting
this stuff to PECL at some point.

All that said, I don't think there is anything inherently unstable about the
provided ncurses library.  It was just kind of messy.

Nice info here:  http://www.zend.com/zend/tut/tut-degan.php

Interesting.  I just took a look at the site.  The documentation, which is
unfortunately only in pdf, could provide better detail on how the thing
operates.

Sanitizing and validating input is so very important, and by the number of
items showing up on bugtraq, is too often overlooked.  My Form Solution
class, http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/software/form/, helps with that
a bit.

It sounds like they're talking about chrooting Apache itself via this 
module, without having to rely on chrooting via the operating system.  
But, what if their module or apache gets circumvented somehow?  Then the 
attacker is home free.

Enjoy,

Hey Again:

Forgot to mention...  I'm wary of an external approach to security because
a programmer can then ignore secure programming practices, which bites us
all in the long run.

I was in the middle of setting up nycsnort.org for Snort/ACID related user
group but seems that alot of people that emailed me were more in tune with
doing an "open source security" related group that was more keen to things
like pen-testing web apps and other network va stuff.  In fact I was a
little suprised by how little people did know in regards to SQL injection
capabilities + XSS.

A good forum is located at http://www.owasp.org/ where you could probably
apply PHP to the Top10 and it would make for a good demo, I find people are
quick to apply patches and then don't study or go over what was actually
done.  Then again I always wished this list was kept up to date:
http://www.phpadvisory.com/advisories/index.phtml

Anyone know what happened to it?

NYPHP member Dave Sklar has actually written a short piece on how you
can protect yourself against these when programming in PHP.

Interesting.  I just took a look at the site.  The documentation, which
is
unfortunately only in pdf, could provide better detail on how the thing
operates.

Sanitizing and validating input is so very important, and by the number
of
items showing up on bugtraq, is too often overlooked.  My Form Solution
class, http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/software/form/, helps with
that
a bit.

It sounds like they're talking about chrooting Apache itself via this
module, without having to rely on chrooting via the operating system.
But, what if their module or apache gets circumvented somehow?  Then the
attacker is home free.

Enjoy,

Subject: OO - when classes are related, who gets which method?
Message-ID: <3EE666A7.5080702@psydeshow.org>

I've got a question for anyone who's an old hand at object-oriented 
programming, or for any new hands with opinions:

Let's say I have a class named Object, and I want to create another 
class that is related to it named Related. I figure I can construct 
Relateds in either of two ways:

$related = $object->createRelated();
or
$related = new Related; $related->create(&$object);

Is there a general rule of thumb that will tell me which is the better 
way to implement this?

The first looks simpler, but something tells me the second is better 
form, because it keeps the creation method inside the class.

    chris.

I presume you're running your laptop as a web server on your LAN?  If so,
other Intranet users can direct their browsers to
http://YOURLAPTOPNAME/phpMyAdmin-2.2.1/index.php .  You might want to look
at Dadabik (www.dadabik.org), I think this is really what you'll want to use
rather than phpMyAdmin.

Thanks Mark,

I'm running a LAMP on my laptop on my LAN and my laptop has a fixed IP
address.  I want people to come in via the internet and see the php form
page.  The php form page pulls data out of tables in the mysql database and
therefore has to be able to access the database.

I hope i'm making sense here.

one up, so now I have http://www.mydomain.com/~mywebuser, but I don't know
how to access it via FTP to upload.  Can someone help me please?

Thank you,
Pinyo

Message-ID: <E19Q75O-0008V4-00@rslrs1-server.com>

going back to a topic similar to the "Re: IIS: $_SERVER & referer" of
mid-May

A server I am using has variables_order set to "no value" when viewed
with PHPINFO()

Using ini_set("variables_order", "EGPCS") PHPINFO() shows the local
value as being changed, yet I am unable to access any values in those
arrays.

Apparently ini_set is not reliable on all config settings, but I find it
strange that PHPINFO() showed the modification.

Am I doing something wrong or missing something else here?

thanks...

p.s. oddly enough, the server has register_globals ON, but no value in
variables_order, but my dev box has register_globals off (as it should
be) and I need to make smooth transition between the environments

But don't they do different things?  The first case returns a Related object,
while the second associates $object with an object of class Related.  I
suppose, depending on how the classes operate internally, the result could be
the same, but from just reading the snippet of code, my procedural brain
would assume something slightly different is happening between the two  :)

Oddly enough, I've been working a lot with objects, and have contemplated
similar things.  You're probably aware of this:

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/ref.objaggregation.php

but it was a new section in the manual for me (just goes to show how long
it's been since I've dealt with objects  :)

ini_set() generally has worked well for me, although sometimes things can't
be set with it (because of the way variable initialization happens).  Even
though variables_order is shown as PHP_INI_ALL (http://us3.php.net/ini_set)
it might be settable only in php.ini/httpd.conf/.htaccess.  See if that makes
a difference.

Is the list set not to post to the sender? I never saw my original post...

I solved my own problem... I'm using HTTP_*_VARS instead, and will
inherit all the inconveniences of same

but at least it works and is an easy search/replace at a later date for
the $_* syntax

thanks, me,

that look like:

php_value variables_order EGPCS

in the .htaccess file?

Yep, they do the same thing, because every Related is associated with an 
Object.

I decided to go with my gut and develop $related->create(&$object) 
because I figure that makes the class more portable. With a little more 
thought it made sense. In this case, Objects don't care how to create 
Relateds-- it's really none of their business. :-)

Thanks Hans!

Subject: mktime
Message-ID: <18D7B8CAA5284F478470828806DB124603789E75@psle01.xchg.pwj.com>

Hi all,
 
I've run into an issue. Supposedly the mktime function will return a UNIX
timestamp while factoring in the timezone offset on the host machine (I
assume this because there is a gmmktime function as well for passing GMT
dates).
 
Anyways, I have written a function that calculates trade dates. I am
currently reproducing the function in VB, and I noticed that the timestamp
returned by PHP's mktime function is 5 hours ahead of the timestamp returned
in VB.
 
The other thing is that I then use the PHP date function to create a
formatted date using the UNIX timestamp returned by mktime. This date seems
to be correct, and the function is working as designed. So my second
question is: If mktime is not factoring the time zone offset on my host, is
the date function compensating for it and returning the correct trade date?
 
Anyone have any insight? Thanks!
==============================
Here's some code:
 
PHP sample:
 
$month = 12;
$day = 26;
$year = 2003;
$hours = 17;
$minutes = 0;
 
$secval =
mktime(intval($hours),intval($minutes),0,intval($month),intval($day),intval(
$year));
 
PRINT $secval; //----->(Returns 1072476000)
==============================
VB sample
 
month = 12
day = 26
year = 2003
hours = 17
minutes = 0
 
strDateFormat = month & "/" & day & "/" & year & " " & hours & ":" & minutes
secval = DateDiff("s", "1/1/1970", strDateFormat)
 
MsgBox secval '----->(Returns 1072458000)

Note that factoring of the timezone concerns the date *given* and not the
timestamp returned.  UNIX timestamps have no timezone.

As it should be, I believe.  VB is probably in the wrong here, and returns a
timestamp that is offset by your timezone.  Nevertheless, VB's version of the
date() function probably expects this behavior, and so usually there aren't
any problems. ( note that NY is of course -0200 )

Exactly.  That's the great thing about UNIX timestamps - they aren't timezone
specific, and so timezone adjustments are done only when creating a human
readable date and time.  Plus, heck, VB is on Windows, how could you expect
it to handle UNIX timestamps correctly  :)  Just out of curiosity, is PHP
running on Windows or a UNIX flavor during these tests?

Subject: Help trying to put email address into filename
Message-ID: <157240-220036311231953973@M2W085.mail2web.com>

Weird but necessary request.. I have to put an email address into a
filename.  Here is my code that I THOUGHT would do so:

foreach (array('.', '_') as $key => $val) {
    $safeEmail = preg_replace("/\\\\$val/e", '%' . ord($val), $email); // YOU
HAVE TO REPLACE . AND _ WITH ASCII NUMBERS
}

This, however, breaks nastily:

Parse error: parse error in /users/ppowell/web/repository.php(89) : regexp
code on line 1

Fatal error: Failed evaluating code: @m? in
/users/ppowell/web/repository.php on line 89

Any ideas, anyone? 

Thanx
Phil

Joshua,

If you haven't already done so, I _strongly_ suggest looking at Dadabik
(www.dadabik.org).  Seems like you might be reinventing the wheel.

thanks Mark,

I'll definitely check out dadabik when I have more time... it looks very
interesting on first inspection...  The problem is that I'm on the tail end
of this project.. this is the last part of the insert activity I have to
work out... so.. hopefully, someone here has something I can use to get
started  (or finished)...

If you want some examples of actually writing the images into the
database, take a look at the mail archives on liphp.org. I posted
some sample code there a while back.

I'm guessing the parse error is due to misusing the "e" modifier.  But,
forget about that, since there are a bunch of other things awry here...

On a minor point, you don't need the $key, since you don't really care
about the key.  You'd just need this:

   foreach (array('.', '_') as $val) {

But, your approach is flawed, since you reassign the output to $safeEmail
from $email, $safeEmail will only have the replacements for the last
element in the input array.  You'd need to use $email as both input and
output for this approach to work.

Finally, a simpler way to do what you're trying to do is via strtr().  For
efficiency sake, I reused $email.

$repl = array(
    '.' => '%46',
    '_' => '%95'
    );

$email = strtr($email, $repl);

Oki dokim so i am going to post here to very nice filers that i have used
for a long time for uploading, saving and storing the images in the
database.
Hope it works out for you...

First one: do_upload.php. This one puts the file on your server:

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
<?
  $dir = "temp/";



  function handleupload() {
   global $HTTP_POST_FILES;
   global $dir;

   if (is_uploaded_file($HTTP_POST_FILES['img1']['tmp_name'])) {
    $filename = $HTTP_POST_FILES['img1']['tmp_name'];
    $realname = $HTTP_POST_FILES['img1']['name'];
    $type = $HTTP_POST_FILES['img1']['type'];
    $filesize = $HTTP_POST_FILES['img1']['size'];
    if($filesize > 496000)
      return "<span class=\\"form\\">Error</span><P
class=\\"texto\\"><b>Atenci?n: </b>Debes seleccionar un fichero menor de
496Kb.</p><p><a href=\\"javascript:history.go(-1);\\">volver</a></p>";
    else{
      //$realname = str_replace("\\ ","_",$realname);
      $realname = str_replace(" ","_",$realname);
      copy($HTTP_POST_FILES['img1']['tmp_name'],$dir.$realname);
      $tipo_foto = GetImageSize($dir.$realname);
      if( $tipo_foto[2] != 2){
         unlink($dir.$realname);
         return "<span class=\\"form\\">Error</span><P
class=\\"texto\\"><b>Warning: </b>You must select a picture in JPEG
format.</p><p><a href=\\"javascript:history.go(-1);\\">volver</a></p>";
      }else{
         @chmod($dir.$realname,0777);
         return "<span class=\\"form\\">Success</span><P
class=\\"texto\\"><b>You sent: </b>".$realname.", with".$filesize."
bytes.</p><p><a href=\\"javascript:window.close()\\">Close window</a></p>";
      }
    }
   } else {
    return "<span class=\\"form\\">Error</span><P class=\\"texto\\"><b>Warning:

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

So here is how it works:
You pass the position on a form of the text input where you are going to
load the image (the select_file.php will fill the form in that position with
the name of the uploaded file).
You can have a button next to the text input saying "Send file...", this
should have an onClick event that would open the select_file.php window.
Remember to pass the position of the picture input text where you want the
name of the picture to be filled.
You can look at how this works in :
http://www.fotosprivadas.com/formulario.php It is spanish sorry, but you can
see the fundamentals of this.
Once you upload the files, you can save the data on your database when you
submit your form.

Hello all--

We have multiple users accessing a big tree of data that's very
expensive to calculate each time. Ideally, it would be great to have
the tree drawn once and then have all the other users access it as
though it were a global SESSION variable visible to all users. 

First of all, is there such a thing as a SESSION variable that's
visible to all?

And then, to send the pie even further into the sky, is there a way to
have a SESSION variable that's held in RAM instead of written to a flat
file?  (Yes, I'm getting greedy in terms of speeding things up.)

Any information and/or links would be very appreciated.

Thanks,

Peter

Microsoft's IIS has Application Variables which, if I recall correctly, are
specific to an application. Here are 2 links which may be of help.
The first covers Application variables in an IIS environment; the second
covers how someone converted an IIS applicaion to a PHP environment. Hope
this is useful.

An open-source phop shopping cart that I was thinking about using for a
future project as well. It's free and updated quite often. This is only if
you're not looking to code the entire thing yourself. It has pricing options
for UPS built into it as well as a bunch of other neat features.

John:

This is extremely helpful.  Thanks! The only nagging doubt I have is
whether a serialized variable stored in flat file format is going to
incur a major performance hit if it happens to be, say, an enormous
associative array. But then, that's another issue entirely--and the
performance can't really be any worse than we're currently getting from
thousands of database calls...

Thanks again,

Peter

Depends on the file format on the CD. If the person who made it 
formatted it as HFS+ (or HFS), then you would need a driver that can 
read that format. Since it's probably proprietary and confidential, I 
don't there is a driver. But nobody should format it using HFS+. What 
error are you getting?

If you have the ability to compile extensions into PHP and you're not
running under Windows you may find useful an extension I wrote. It can
currently only cache scalar values though and it sounds like arrays might
prove more useful in your case.

I've read some complaints about the manual being less than adequate,
however, I was considering hiring xcarts services to make modifications
that I wasn't able to complete myself...

if anyone has actual experience with xcart I'd also be interested to

Those are very exciting.  Hopefully we'll be able to convince our

The feature that caught my eye was the tie-in to U.P.S., FedEx, etc.

I'd also be interested in "real-life" experience.  Any takers?

I've never dealt directly with X-Cart from a development standpoint, but I do
administer servers and support clients that use it (our hosting company is
one listed on http://www.x-cart.com/webhosting_companies.html).  So far, it's
been fairly easy to support and the clients always seem satisfied.

Hmmm...

Sure; application variables, as mentioned.  But the reason I say 'Hmmm' is
because application variables, regardless of how they are stored/implemented,
probably aren't the best way to go for large amounts of data.  If you're
dealing with a big tree of data, and the issue is the expense of calculating
it for every request, I'd very much prefer using it in a cooked format.

For instance, every 1000 hits (or time based, doesn't matter) a special query
is run that cooks the raw data (the large set) into a calculated, more
manageable form.  This cooked form is then stored in an optimized database
schema, or even HEAP tables, for example, if you're really worried.  Some
call it a data mart, others data mining, and still other's just logical
architecture.  We do it here on a nightly basis for much of our data, and
then several times a day for more volitale items.

Sure.  This, again, is essentially an application variable (in other
languages, they are stored in RAM by default).  If you wanted true SESSION
variables (per user) to be stored in RAM, then you can use PHP's
session_handler functions.  For application scope, shared memory is always
fun:

http://phpnow.net/src/

I haven't gotten around to finishing it yet, but you're welcome to use
whatever.  Also, don't forget the kernel will cache files for you, which is
unbeatable as far as performance (especially with small amounts of data). 
Or, implement application variables via MySQL - persistent connections,
indexed HEAP tables, and queries based on integers is damn hard to beat.

You'll be hitting a DB2 server, no?  I haven't done it myself, so all I can
say is:

Subject: parse error
Message-ID: <001501c3313c$3f5268b0$8b00a8c0@timmerslaptop>

I'm having trouble with this simple little script I have to delete a row from mysql. Users click on the delete link, then have a chance to make sure they want to delete the row and if they click the "yes" radio it executes this portion of the script:

if (isset($_POST['delete_yes'])) {
$_POST['id'] = $id
$delete_query = "DELETE * FROM products WHERE id = '$id'";
$do_delete_query = mysql_query($delete_query) or die(mysql_error()); 
echo ("Successfully deleted product.<BR><BR>");
echo ("<a href='index.php'>Return to Product DB Admin.</a>");
}

the $_POST['id'] is just a hidden field that grabs the id from the get variable ID. This looks a little odd to me, but I still can't understand why it won't work

I've tried changing the $delete_query to
$delete_query = DELETE * FROM products WHERE id = $_POST['id']; but then I get T_Variable parse errors.

Anyone know how to fix this?

my god, I can't believe it, see I changed that part like 3 times and maybe I
just missed it.

Thing is I get this error after that (and this was happening before as well)
its a mysql error at the first line of my mysql

You have an error in your SQL syntax near '* FROM products WHERE id = '41''
at line 1

it works properly, gets the right number but then I get mysql error
wait, I forgot, I typed in SELECT instead of DELETE

geez its been one of those days.

thanks guys,

I believe your your $_POST['id']=$id; line is incorrect. Should you not be
getting data into $id from $_POST? i.e.
 
$id = $_POST['id'];

Ooops, missed your delete syntax error.
 
A delete query is in this format:
 
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition='something' 
 
No * between DELETE and FROM.

Bad Request
Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.

Size of a request header field exceeds server limit.

Using MSIE 5.1.6 on the Mac I get this error for every page on the site

Suggestions?

I've seen this error when passing large strings as GET requests.  Typically,
4k will stop Apache by default.  Other than that, it's either a server
misconfiguration, or wacky browser behavior, although I'm not sure why.

That makes sense -- except that I get the message no matter what page I'm
requesting.
Is there a way to clear the header?

Wacky browser for sure, as I don't have the problem with Netscape.

Hello

I've been hacking PHP for a while but I am a RedHat system administration
rookie, trying to migrate from Windows 2K (tho I sometimes wonder why).
The goal here is get a development machine working, and serve some
personal stuff to the world just for kicks.

This RH9 comes with Mysql 3.32.56 and Apache 2.0.40 and PHP 4.2.2 right
out of the box and everything appeared fine at first. Then I tried
connecting to a mysql database with PEAR.

Spent a couple hours going crazy wondering why pear kept saying "DB
extension not found", messing with include_path() and require()  and so
forth till I finally decided, hey, try connecting to mysql the traditional
way. Guess what:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function: mysql_connect() in ....

Then I recalled again that people say apache 2.x has security as well as
compatibilty problems (while The Apache folks tells us 2.x is the latest
and greatest).

So here's the question (thanx for your patience): what do you experienced
and wise folks recommend as a general strategy for this? Upgrade PHP or
downgrade Apache? Build either or both from source, or get RPMs somewhere?

Very gratefully,

	David

When it comes to PHP and Apache, it is well worth the learning curve to 
build them from source -- neither is particularly difficult and you'll 
have the option of including all sorts of extras that aren't necessarily 
available in RPM. Plus you'll know that you can get new versions within 
minutes of their release, rather than waiting for the packages to hit 
the RH Network.

Your standard Red Hat system might not have all of the tools and 
development libraries required to compile from source. This can be 
frustrating. If you didn't install the Development Tools along with the 
system, and you're not short on disk space, you might want to stop and 
upgade before you try to build anything. Keep the CDs handy for the odd 
thing you might need to add as you go along.

One other note, I'm not sure if it still holds, but the general 
consensus around NYPHP has been to use Apache 1.3.27 rather than Apache 
2.x. Latest isn't always greatest. BTW, I'm running AMP on a RH8 box, 
and it works great. Please don't hesitate to ask when you run up against 
RH's sometimes bizarre administration practices.

Heh, that's an evil combination of versions - bad RedHat, no bone.

There are certainly stability/sanity issues with apache 2.x (IMHO anyway). 
I've had success compiling everything from source, but wouldn't want to do it
again.

If you want the full ecstasy of AMP, I'd downgrade Apache to 1.3, upgrade PHP
to the latest, and install mysql.com's binary package of 4.0.13.  Personally,
I always like to compile everything from source (except MySQL) but if you can
find the proper RPMs then it'd probably work just as well.

That said, your specific problem is related to the versions so much as it is
the RPM packages.  For whatever reason, the PHP package doesn't seem to be
loading the MySQL extension.  Check your php.ini to ensure that it's getting
loaded somewhere (although I have no idea why RH wouldn't just compile it in
staticly).

Thanks for the replies. I think I'll try building both php 4.3 and apache
1.3.27 from source.

QUESTION:  should I first remove Apache 2.x and if so, how? I tried

rpm --erase httpd-2.0.40-21.3

and got lots of warnings about failed dependencies -- I take it to mean
things that would break if I remove the package [output appended].

QUESTION:  should I also try to get rid of httpd-manual-2.0.40-21.3 and
httpd-2.0.40-21.3? These seem to be friends of httpd-2.0[xxxx] that I
found by grepping the output of rpm ---qa

Thanks again!

Two ways to answer that-- if you don't need them, go ahead and get rid 
of them. Google on the name of any package you don't know the use of, 
all of the packages listed can be installed separately against Apache 
1.3 if you need them. There's certainly nothing crucial to system 
operation in that list.

Or...

Find out where Red Hat installed Apache 2.0 and install 1.3 in a 
different place (/usr/local for instance). But then you have to worry 
about making sure that 2.0 isn't running when you want to run 1.3, etc etc.

Woohoooo this is exciting. I have obliterated apache2.0 and everything
that depended on it, so now I'm committed to Plan A.

Thanks again, and in advance if there's a next time I come a-crying for
help (which I'm determined to avoid).

Wow. Building PHP with lots of bells and whistles (i.e., --with-this and
--with-that) on a RH 9.0 system when you don't really know what your doing
is HARD. It finally worked with a bare minimal configure command. Woulda
been easy if I'd tried it that way first, and tried the heroics later
(much later).

Building Apache 1.3.27 was astoundingly easy. Thank you, "Programming PHP"
(Lerdorf & Tatroe, O'Reilly).

My fellow rookies, take heart.

Thanks again for the help.

You can only have one primary key. If you're thinking about a unique index
on multiple columns, yes you can do that, and indeed there are situations
where you do. You might not need any primary key in that case.

I'll give you an example. I have a table called 'interpreter' (of
languages) and a table called 'language'. Some interpreters have multiple
working languages; lots of languages are spoken by more than one
interpreter. You resolve the many-to-many relationship with a third table
called interpreter_language which looks something like this (English is
asumed in this particular application, so I only one the 'foreign'
language to store each interpreters' language pair). Note the unique key:

CREATE TABLE interpreter_language (
  interpreter_id smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  language_id smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  UNIQUE KEY idx1 (interp_id,lang_id)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

Insertion fails if somebody tries to enter a duplicate record.

HTH!

I see.
I think I confused a primary key using a combination of columns in a table
versus having 2 primary keys in a table, which obviously can't exits.
Thanks for your help.

Peter,

You can set mutilple fields in a table to be a primary key. In general, the
combination of the field makes the key.
http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql/bychapter/manual_Reference.html#CRE
ATE_TABLE

Look at the line:
PRIMARY KEY (index_col_name,...)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] setting up AMP w/ RH 9.0
Message-ID: <BAY2-F334YFM8De4wk20000b972@hotmail.com>

David,

If you're still having trouble or want to give it another try, here are some 
instructions I put together a couple of weeks ago for some coworkers.

It was put together on a clean workstation build of RH 9.  It's not 
particularly pretty, but it worked for our purposes:


RedHat 9.0

I. Download and compile - if necessary - Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

	1. Download Apache 1.3.27 source to '/usr/local' and compile. (current 
version: 1.3.27)
	   http://apache.org/dist/httpd/
	    shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=most 
--enable-shared=max
	    shell> make
	    shell> make install
	    shell> /user/local/apache/bin/apachectl start

	2. Install binary version of 4.0.12 MySQL. (current version: 4.0.12)
	   http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html
	   Change to the '/usr/local' directory and extract the MySQL tar.gz into 
this directory.
	   Then create a symbolic link to it like so:
	   'ln -s mysql-standard-4.0.12-pc-linux-i686 mysql'

	   Now, change to the '/usr/local/mysql' directory and run the following 
commands:
		shell> groupadd mysql
		shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
		shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
		shell> chown -R root  .
		shell> chown -R mysql data
		shell> chgrp -R mysql .
		shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

	3. Download PHP 4.3.x source to '/usr/local' and compile. (current version: 
4.3.1)
	   http://php.net/downloads.php
	   Use the following build flags:
	   shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local 
--with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs --enable-inline-optimization 
--enable-magic-quotes --enable-track-vars --enable-bcmath 
--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql --with-xml
	   shell> make
	   shell> make install

	4. Configure Apache and PHP:
	   Open up '/usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf' and add the following lines:
	   LoadModule php4_module        libexec/libphp4.so
	   AddModule mod_php4.c
	   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php




>Wow. Building PHP with lots of bells and whistles (i.e., --with-this and
>--with-that) on a RH 9.0 system when you don't really know what your doing

Thanks, I will treat this like the priceless treasure that it is (-:

Actually I did get my AMP going but I want to try again with more cool
stuff enabled, so this may prove quite helpful.

Subject: watching external URL traffic
Message-ID: <JMEHLOIOFHBEJDCDJNLOIEABCLAA.chendry@nyc.rr.com>

Here's the situation:

I've got a client that books sales through an external frameset.  This
client also drives traffic from an affiliate, which utilizes links through
commission junction and also wraps the same frameset that my client uses
directly.

There is the possibility that this affiliate is screwing around on us -
possibly manipulating queries passed to the frameset (which does the sales).

Are there any ways I can watch his website and the traffic, or requests?
Anything would be helpful.

Thanks,
Chris

$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']
$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']

They can be used to help identify who's requesting the page.  Use these 
bits as you're logging the variable values you care about in your 
application.

yes, but the problem is this is someone else's website, linking to a third
party site.

I'm wondering if there are any tools out there that can help me watch the
site from the outside.

Sure... key in you CC number to 1-800-CRACKER and someone will be in touch
shortly  :)

So you want to see what hits his site is getting and then passing to you, and
compare it with what he says he's getting and passing to you?

Well, baring anything devious, I can't think of a foolproof way to do that
really.  Depending on how determined he might be, you can of course check
REFERER, or put hidden keys of some sort in the framesets.  If you have the
ability to rotate these keys at some level, you might be able to catch if
he's synthesizing requests.

That's a bit amorphous, I know.

yes, I'd like to compare what he says versus the actual.

Unfortunately, I can't even put anything in the frameset...he's simply using
my client's link to the source.

Perhaps the best solution is to change the way he interacts with us.

I had heard someone mention once that there was a way to watch a site and
see what errors it throws, 404s et al.

Did I dream this?

not really unless you do have access to that machine for netcat, rmon
w/ethereal,etc.

or you can use ur imagination to poison the dns for the site and ip forward
all the traffic along to his site but last time i checked u end up in jail
for that type of stuff :-)

i know there are things like urlminder that can watch page modification for
you but you can probably also attempt this with ur own scripts (if you are
looking for hidden field changes or something) w/ php/curl/wget/etc.

My friend is doing some development on my box.  When he returns a row from a

as an array (i.e. $row[n]). He tells me that all versions of php he's worked
with have done this automatically. Is there some config setting I need to
change on my system to manage this behavior? ...

If he's just linking to a static link on your client's page, then it'll be
tough.  However, if you could enforce something on his side (for instance a
call-ahead or dynamic link of sorts) that may make it tougher for him to
fiddle with things, albeit far from bulletproof.  A direct solution may be to
simple examine the IP that is referred from him - is it ping'able,
traceroute'able - does it seem like an average user (you'd end up with IPs
from many different subnets, reverse DNS resolutions, etc.) or is there an
odd pattern?

See what errors his site throws?  Yes, 1-800-CRACKER  :)  unless of course
you can enforce some behavior on his end.

mysql_fetch_assoc() will return a "hash" or associative array in PHP-speak.

$q='select * from table where 1=1';    //is the query you write.
$result=mysql_query($q);  //to execute the query

If he uses this:
$row=mysql_fetch_row($result);

.....then he'll access a field by $row[n]

If he uses this:
$row=mysql_fetch_array($result):

....then he'll access a field by $row["field_name"]

Hope it helps!! You don't need to change any config setting to manage this, it 
all depends on the code.

Subject: Child process terminates
Message-ID: <02dd01c3357e$035ddba0$3500a8c0@com1>

Hello all,

I often find from my error log that there exists thousands of lines of errors continuosly, like below.

Child process 20456 didn't exist, sent SIGHUP
Child process 20460 didn't exist, sent SIGHUP
Child process 20476 didn't exist, sent SIGHUP

Theoretically I know reason of this error, but i am not Linux or Server expert hence i am not able to find specific practicle reason/s that why this error is making my log file full and what process is causing it. As a temporary solution i have to restart my apache at regular interval otherwise log file gets full with erros.

I am using Apache 1.3.27, php 4.3.1, MySql 3.23.55, GD 1.6.2 and higher, Perl 5.8.0 and other packages. 

I know these info may not be sufficent to find reason of erros, but i hope someone can guide me in proper way.

I want to know general or likely reason/s of this error. Whether it is PHP or Apache or Perl or Wrong configuaration of software? that is causing such errors.

Thanks,

Anirudh Zala

Have a look at http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysql.php et seq.

You don't say which mysql_fetch_xxxx() function your friend is calling, If
it's mysql_fetch_row() he should expect a numerically indexed array. If
it's mysql_fetch_array() he can pass in a second argument indicating what
he wants: assocative or number indices or both, which is supposed to be
the default. See
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-fetch-array.php

Have you looked at mod_rewrite?

Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. I think you'd want 
something like:

RewriteCond   %{REQUEST_FILENAME} ^/[0-9]+
RewriteRule   ^/([0-9]+)     /somepage.php?variable=$1 [L,R]

Downsides: you have to read the manual, and you probably have to 
recompile Apache-- it's not enabled by default.
Upsides: people will think you're an Apache guru, and so you shall be.

How does MySQL handle the following?

I'm trying to save a car model called "1600 DUETTO SPIDER."
I noticed it saves it with underscores.

What happens when I retrieve that data in a query? Does it come back as
1600_DUETTO_SPIDER?
Or, if I need to retain the spaces, do I do something like %20 or
something like &nbsp; when I save the data?

Ok, gotcha.  PHP is turning the name of the checkbox from ALFA-ROMEO|1600
DUETTO SPIDER to ALFA-ROMEO 1600 DUETTO SPIDER.  If you need to do it this
way, before you do the insert, I would just do a str_replace() on the
string, swapping underscores for spaces.  MySQL certainly doesn't have an
issue storing data with spaces.

Nice car, by the way. :-)

Jeff,

What does your insert query look like, and what type of column are you
inserting into?  I can't yet see why this would happen (spaces replaced
with
underscores).

How does MySQL handle the following?

I'm trying to save a car model called "1600 DUETTO SPIDER."
I noticed it saves it with underscores.

What happens when I retrieve that data in a query? Does it come back as
1600_DUETTO_SPIDER?
Or, if I need to retain the spaces, do I do something like %20 or
something like &nbsp; when I save the data?

Ok, gotcha.  PHP is turning the name of the checkbox from
ALFA-ROMEO|1600
DUETTO SPIDER to ALFA-ROMEO 1600 DUETTO SPIDER.  If you need to do it
this
way, before you do the insert, I would just do a str_replace() on the
string, swapping underscores for spaces.  MySQL certainly doesn't have
an
issue storing data with spaces.

Nice car, by the way. :-)

While some folks have suggested using string replace functions on the 
incomming data, I beg to differ.

Text values like that aren't meant for name fields.  Perhaps swap the 
value and name fields?  Or for the name and/or value fields, use 
id numbers from the database.  The name could even be an array, such as:

   name="car[123]"

allowing your receiving script to loop through all of the "car" array 
elements with a foreach statement.

Without knowing the more context of what you're trying to do, it's hard to 
give more solid guidance.

You could set up a mail filter via procmail or your email program to send

Don't know exactly how you've got things set up, but maybe you could
change this to:

<input name="car_model[]" type="checkbox" value="ALFA-ROMEO|1600 DUETTO
SPIDER">

names can't have spaces, but values can. Also, looping through
car_model can be easier than a bunch of ifs.

WHATever.  It accomplishes the person's goal of not having to see messages
while still being subscribed to the list.  I imagine such an option
doesn't exist in our list management program.  Do you have a better
answer?

Oh, if you're dishing out inane criticism, how about taking some...  
Leaving the entirety of the prior person's message, including their
signature and the list's unsubscribe message -- let alone top posting --
is poor practice.

Later,

I totally agree on this. It's neat and easy to implement. It's better than 
using string functions.

It was a poor question.  If you don't get messages from the list, what makes
you subscribed to it?  Aside from the variation of a digest, which isn't
currently available, the closest thing are the realtime archives online.

We know there are lacking features with the list - I wrote it in a couple of
days when NYPHP had but 10 users, and it was never meant to last this long,
nor support this many people.  A major revamp will be happening in the coming
the weeks/months, including anonymous IMAP archives, digests, XML goodies,
etc.

If anyone has suggestions for what they'd like to see, we invite you to
subscribe to dev at nyphp.org and post them there for discussion.  Of course,
those who would like to participate in the development process itself (ie,
code/frontend/quality assurance) are always welcome.

Thanks,

H

hi,

im trying to determine if this type of package already exists or if its
worth actually building but on phpMyAdmin what id really like is the ability
itself to create php-based insert forms directly from export ... (View dump
(schema) of table) ... i beleive something like forms-based in access that
already exists but having the ability directly to plug into a php-app.
(complete w/ pull down/multiple select/booleans/etc).

it might be just a case of modifying tbl_dump.php and creating another
export plugin for it.  does a similar package exist?  (mysql -> php form)

switch(url)
{
   match format a: go to page b; break;

   --

actually it's pretty close ... i attempted something likewise a while back
w/ JDBC 2 but what i really wanted was a complete package that could create
form checking and validation @ the same time js + form post code, the works.
so describe the table + create a single row insert tool w/ all the needed
libraries for checking types (varchar lengths, booleans, selects, etc).

i thought i saw a form manager package for php/mysql somewhere.

It should not be that difficult to program that in.

Let's see. It could be done under an hour.

alter table users....

if dontsend == 'y', don't send

you have an interface to check that.

Or use Gmane or Mailman

Procmail and filter? You will get into trouble one of these days if you do
things like that. That is why it is a poor answer.

Chalu, I still don't see why this would help you, even if it was 
programmed in.  If you are trying to filter the list because you don't 
want to see "newbie" questions, how is staying subscribed to the list 
while not receiving any email from it going to benefit you?

Are you just going to want to change your preferences and receive email 
when you ask a question?  If so, that is pretty selfish and goes 
against the spirit of a listserve, IMHO.

Anyone know a quick and painless way I can dump POST vars into a format that
will be somewhat readable to the layperson receiving it via the mail()
function?

Thanks.

$Body = implode("\

or

$Body = '';

foreach ($Array as $Key => $Val) {
    $Body .= "$Key:  $Val\

";

In my exmaples I used $Array.  To better answer your question, use $_POST 
instead of $Array.

One last thing

Where do you unsubscribe?

I look at the web site and in the past, I requested to get off.

Dude, the method of unsubscribing is mentioned on the bottom of each and

Did you check before you say that?

It does not say unsubscribe. Just log in it says. Just a few seconds it
says.

NYPHP is like a death trap. You figure out what to do?

Do you even have forgotten password?

This is the worst. Does it even have privacy statement? Can you share our
emails with others?

New York PHP is a copy righted.

Hello,

This is the dude who just got started with a fresh AMP environment on my
Red Hat 9 box, thanks again for the help. It's workin'.

I notice that phpinfo() output includes $_ENV, which seems a little
intrusive, and I'm wondering why and what can be done about it. (I googled
for this and found a thousand people's phpinfo hanging out in public, and
one reference to the issuee, but no solution. Perused the php docs too.)

My httpd is running as nobody and the script in question is owned by user
david, that's whose environment is being printed.

I recognize that it's not considered good security practice to advertise
your phpinfo and I don't plan to, but I'm curious about this anyway. TIA.

egenius,

If you seriously can't figure out how to unsubscribe, ask the listmaster at
listmaster at nyphp.org to help you rather than spamming the list.

Do you know anything not to use inflamatory on the list?

It is not a good form, David.

NYPHP list,

Let's not make matters worse. Just ignore any of Chalu's posting. I
understand that it is very enoying, but these things happen on even the best
of lists!

Hans will be in contact directly with Chalu (off list).

Please let this be the last post on this issue.

Listen to yourself. Daniel.I understand it is very enjoying.

This is like entering a red neck country. It is just that you can't tolerate
difference in opinions and how people use lists.

For example, I just don't see the reason why you create your own list for it
is very complex to build a good tool. Look at the feature sets of Gmane or
Mailman.

My opinion of the NYPHP has been dimmed by this flurry of email exchanges.

All the best

Dear NYPHPers

Nothing is matter with me.  Awhile back like a month or two ago, I asked
Hans and rather the web master to remove me from the list. I asked about
retrieving my password.

Nothing happened.

Now, I asked politely about the digest mode so that I can reduce amount of
individual emails I receive. This is what I get for getting this done.
Hopefully, I raise enough noise to get off this list this time.

That is all.

You get it now. I am not too happy about that way things turned out with
this NYPHP mailing list.

Take a look at the blurb about variables_order at
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/configuration.directives.php.  You'll want to
take the 'E' out of that setting, which can be done via php.ini or

Dan,

Thanks for your input...here's some more info on what I'm doing.

On Form 1 a car dealer selects a manufacturer, say, Audi and Alfa-Romeo.
On Form 2, I generate all of the models for these manufacturers and
provide a checkbox next to each model. 

To differentiate makes/models on the page I generate checkboxes that
look like the following:

<input name="ALFA-ROMEO|GTV-6" type="checkbox" value="1" checked >
<input name="ALFA-ROMEO|SPIDER VELOCE" type="checkbox" value="1">

First part gives me the manufacturer, second part gives me the model.

The problem is the Post data. For example, look what happens to the
Spider Veloce:
(I used var_dump)
  ["ALFA-ROMEO|1600_DUETTO_SPIDER"]

The post data has underscores.

But the other part of the issue is that the page posts to itself if
there is a data error and checks the various checkboxes depending on the
post data. In the case where the post data is ["ALFA-ROMEO|GTV-6"] it's
easy enough to do.

So...do I do something like a str_replace function to remove the
underscores?

Keep in mind that I'm on php 4.1.x and it does not have htmlentities nor
html_decode_entity.

Jeff

While some folks have suggested using string replace functions on the 
incomming data, I beg to differ.

Text values like that aren't meant for name fields.  Perhaps swap the 
value and name fields?  Or for the name and/or value fields, use 
id numbers from the database.  The name could even be an array, such as:

   name="car[123]"

allowing your receiving script to loop through all of the "car" array 
elements with a foreach statement.

Without knowing the more context of what you're trying to do, it's hard
to 
give more solid guidance.

But what you haven't clarified is the forms actual purpose.  Okay, so,
you're processing the manufacturer and model in the checkboxes.  But what
does it mean if someone checks the box?  In addition, what other data is
submitted?  What are you doing with all of this data?

Before writing what I just wrote, I started writing the following, so I'm 
leaving it here to avoid having to restate it later...

You mentioned using a database.  I assume each manufacturer and each model
are represented by integer based primary keys.  Right?  Again, if you want
to store both the manufacturer and model ID numbers in the name attribute
of the name element, do this:

   <input name="cars[5][23]" ... />
   <input name="cars[5][50]" ... />
   <input name="cars[10][2]" ... />

Where the first key is the manufacturer and the second key is the model.


> The post data has underscores.

Which is why I'm saying you should use use a different approach.

The purpose:

If a box is checked it means that the dealer sells parts for that
particular make/model. This data is then used to match a purchaser to a
dealer(s) depending on the user's needs.

Now I *wish* I could say that the makes/models had identifying keys
however...things are worse than that. This data is matched against a
table containing 2.5 million rows (that's right! 2.5 million rows) of
non-normalized data that contains information on most every part for
most every make/model made since about 1952. This data comes from
another source and, therefore, there is nothing that can be done to
normalize the data (it's a L-O-N-G story as to why it can not be
normalized...makes/models are simply text strings within each row).
Consequently, the text is needed because a match is made by matching
text strings.

Not the greatest system, I admit, but sometimes one has to work with
what one is given.

I've tried the str_replace and that seems to have done the trick (at
least in preselecting check boxes based on post data) and I'll use it
again to strip out underscores when I save it to the database.

I'm open to suggestions if you have another idea.

Jeff,

Why can't you build your own table for make/model?  You can run a process
that parses each row of data lookup the string in your table.  If the string
doesn't exist in your table, add it with a unique int ID.  If it exists in
your table, move to the next row of your denormalized table.  What you will
end up with is a table with 2 columns, ID and MakeModel.  ID is an int set
as primary key, MakeModel is a varchar with a unique index.  Now you can
build your form using the ID's from your table rather than the MakeModel
string.

Even if the data is coming from another source, normalization of the data
makes much more sense than trying to use the data in denormalized condition.
Your app will perform much better and will be much easier to troubleshoot
and maintain.  Even if the data is not under your control I would sugest
writing a background process that periodically parses the data and puts it
into your own normalized tables.

I had originally intended to do that, that is, normalize the data. The
idea was "killed" a long time ago by the client.

Let me make matters worse, so to speak. This data has a part code that
represents each different car part, e.g., brakes; fender, etc. However,
the company that creates the data (*not* my client) decided to use the
same exact part code number for different parts so that every electronic
module in a car has the part code "591" even though one module may
control air bags and one may control ignition, etc. Further, part
dealers know the parts by these 3 digit codes and can differentiate them
by their description (ignition; air bag, etc.). So it requires a part
code and text description to differentiate an air bag control module for
a Buick from one from a Chevy, etc.  Even the make/model information
that is provided is not complete....for example, some parts are lumped
in under Mercedes Benz even though there are many different models of
Mercedes. 

The bottom line is that the data is not pretty.

You really like to push PHP to the limits! You owe me a nickel:

mail($admin_email, $email_title, is_array($_POST) && count($_POST) > 0 ?
call_user_func_array(($foo = create_function ('$vars, $vals, $ind, $foo',

Sounds to me you have the perfect situation to make lots of money!

While it may be a real PITN to work with data that horribly structured, it
does mean that everything you do will take 3-4 times as long to write and
will be very prone to bugs.  Any time I have a client force me into a poor
design decision, I document the hell out of it so that every time the client
complains how long it takes me to do XY & Z, or how many anomolies are in
the program, I gently remind them that if they had agreed to proper design
from the start they would get faster development times, better performing
applications, and relatively bug free code.  When a client hears that
message enough times in answer to their complaints, they either stop
complaining, stop development, or take it in the wallet and go for a
redesign so that the wallet doesn't hurt so much in the future.

It's sort of like I used to love working with Oracle databases because they
were so complicated and poorly documented.  It's not that I loved the work
so much as I loved getting the money caused by Oracles complexity!

This will *definitely* be a long time client. They are well aware of the
problems with the data and prior to beginning the project we had lengthy
discussions with the company that creates the data. This data is used by
parts dealers across the continent so they were not keen on the idea of
doing it the "right way" nor was the client keen on shelling out the
money to "normalize" the data. There are many more data issues...I only
touched the tip of the iceberg.

Why don't you make the input name an array value like:
"makes[ALFA-ROMEO]" and give it a value of "GTV-6" or "SPIDER VELOCE"?

Then, you can do something like:

foreach ($makes as $make => $model) {
   print "Dealer has an $make $model";
}

Right now, you're probably doing something like:

foreach ($_POST as $data) {
    $clean = str_replace($data, "_", "-");
    list($make, $model) = split($clean, "|");
    print "Dealer has a $make $model";
}

(I may have some function parameter orders mixed up here.)

Since the browser only sends back "checked" checkboxes to the server,
what's the point of setting a value of "1"? Things should be easier if
you set the value to an actually useful value, like say, the model, or
even the make and the model. Then, at least, you wouldn't need to
worry about the weird re-encoding of the data and the restriction on spaces.

FWIW, htmlentities() has been around forever, so it should be in
4.1. Besides, that's pretty easy to mimic with strtr():

$from = array('&', '<', '>', '"');
$to   = array('&amp;', '&lt;', '&gt;', '&quot;');
$html = strtr($ascii, $from, $to);

(Well, you may have to rearrange the order to do a double pass because
of the &, but this is a good start.)

Adam,

I was mistaken about htmlentities...I believe it's html_entity_decode
that doesn't exist in 4.1.

And your "guess" on how it is being done is right on the mark. Quite
honestly, I hadn't thought about just setting the value to the model
(instead of '1').

You offered some great ideas...I'm going to revisit the code and, if
time permits, go with the suggestion of input name as array with a value
= the model.

Thanks so much for putting in the effort to help straighten this out
(and thanks go to everyone else who offered suggestions).

Jeff
P.S. I may have failed to mention that I started using PHP about 5
months ago...when I started this project...so I'm always learning
something new.

The "at" symbol is just to ignore error messages if the server does not
support mail() function.

A little upgrade:
 	foreach (array_keys($_POST) as $key ) { $mailBody .= "$$key =
$_POST[$key]\
"; }
 	@mail($admin_email, $email_title, $mailBody, $optional_header);

Add spaces in first line between equal symbol.

Hello all,

New York PHP continues its efforts to improve service for members by moving
to a new server.  This server is more powerful, better connected and will
offer breathing room for development on the old box.

Starting at 8:00pm EST tonight, NYPHP.org and mailing lists will be
unavailable.  The website itself should be back online within an hour;
however other services, such as the mailing lists, mailboxes and aliases,
will be unavailable for a longer period of time.  The NYPHP Mirrors will not
be affected, and by Saturday evening all other services should be
operational, with another announcement at that time.  Please note, however,
that some member's DNS servers aggressively cache, resulting in additional,
temporary outages.

By Monday morning all should be back to normal, and I'll be available at
hans at nyu.edu at any time.

Thank you,

The email validation thread reminded me, This fee lil app was recently
reccommended to me http://weitz.de/regex-coach/

It's a TRUE life saver when it comes to complex regex...

Here's a blurb from the link:
----------------------------------
The Regex Coach is a graphical application for Linux and Windows which
can be used to experiment with (Perl-compatible) regular expressions
interactively. It has the following features: 

It shows whether a regular expression matches a particular target
string. 
It can also show which parts of the target string correspond to captured
register groups or to arbitrary parts of the regular expression. 
It can "walk" through the target string one match at a time. 
It can simulate Perl's split and s/// (substitution) operators. 
It tries to describe the regular expression in plain English. 
It can show a graphical representation of the regular expression's parse
tree. 
It can single-step through the matching process as performed by the
regex engine. 
Everything happens in "real time", i.e. as soon as you make a change
somewhere in the application all other parts are instantly updated. 

----------------------------------

(I'm in no way affiliated with the developer, just thought I'd pass
along the great tool)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] New York PHP Adopts Mailman as Mailing List Manager
Message-ID: <3F00A11C.3000701@nyphp.org>


Apologies to those who will receive this message multiple times; we are still in a testing phase with Mailman.

Due to member's requests and the current system falling short in some respects, NYPHP's mailing lists are now operated by Mailman (http://list.org).  This is anticipated as temporary until our own system is upgraded and enhanced.

There are both pros and cons to using Mailman in contrast to our home-grown system (which was entirely in PHP):

Pros:
-- Handles modern MIME messages better, including attachments and HTML or signed messages
-- Highly anticipated "Send me my password" functionality
-- Digests
-- Generic yet familiar interface (http://lists.nyphp.org)

Cons:
-- Ghost accounts are not available with Mailman - all mailing list posts must come from a single email address.
-- The "Active Threads" area of http://nyphp.org is lost (if you are familiar with Mailman, please contact our Development list (dev at lists.nyphp.org) with any ideas on how this could be implemented using Mailman's static HTML archives)
-- Date and time information of messages can be incorrect (the old system timestamped each message)
-- Mailman is a bit slower than our PHP version

Please take a look at the system (http://lists.nyphp.org) and report any errors, enhancements and suggestions to listmaster at nyphp.org or our Development list (dev at lists.nyphp.org), and we urge you to take advantage of new features such as list digests and other customizations.

Development continues on our mailing list manager, pList, as our CVS/SourceForge server goes on line.  Many exciting features are planned, including subscribing/unsubscribing from specific threads, full-text search of archives, user comments of archived messages, accurate discussion threading, web forum integration and RSS feeds.  We?d also like to hear your suggestions and ideas at dev at lists.nyphp.org.

Lastly, please send any errors, configuration issues or suggestions regarding the new Mailman installation to listmaster at nyphp.org

Thank you,

New York PHP
