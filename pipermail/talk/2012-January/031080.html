Justin is, as usual, correct about all of this.  But as someone who's been
involved in CS curriculum design at the associates level for going on 12
years now, the problem -- at least for us at the community college level --
is that we can only make our students take 66 credits, of physics and music
and English and all the other stuff, along with CS and math.  I would love
to offer our CS students a course on these software engineering topics,
like source control and unit tests and how to do a code review, but not at
the expense of assembly or linear algebra, and SUNY won't let us do it at
the expense of sociology or art.  (That's not a complaint; I think the
curriculum *should* be well-rounded.  We just don't have space.)
