Personally, I don't think PHP is a good &quot;first&quot; language, so I expect 
people picking up PHP to already have covered &quot;basics&quot;. :-)

While PHP can be run from the command line, it's biggest usage is in web 
design.  So learning PHP involves using MySQL, Javascript, HTML, and 
CSS.  Since all of that needs to be covered as well, you might as well 
do it all right.

Also, &quot;checking bad code&quot; into version control is productive.  When 
someone is first learning code, they may well 6 or 7 different ways of 
doing something.  By the time they get to number 7, they may decide that 
the third solution was the best.  Without version control, it means they 
will be making bad filename choices[attempt1.php, attempt2.php, 
attempt3.php] or relying heavily on their editors undo function.  Wheras 
if they were using version control from the start, then they can revert 
to the version they saved on the third attempt, and by the time their 
done with the course they will have the habit of trying lots of things 
and reverting code when needed.
