<PRE>I have to strongly second this.  Learning programming means learning 
algorithms and data structures.  Learning the job a programmer does 
includes version control, unit testing and many other things.  Learning 
a language or ten is one of those other things, but it's not part of 
learning programming, it's learning syntax.

Being a competent professional programmer means learning all of them, 
but version control doesn't include syntax and programming doesn't 
include PHP.  A book on PHP shouldn't include data structures OR version 
control - those are separate subjects.

My not-even-two-cents.

</I>&gt;<i>     One thing that has annoyed me more and more over time is the way
</I>&gt;<i>     books and classes go about teaching /how/ to program in a language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     They all start off with &quot;Hello World&quot; and then progress slowly
</I>&gt;<i>     form there to more and more complicated things.  I've noticed that
</I>&gt;<i>     even Ruby books, the poster child for unit testing, proceed in
</I>&gt;<i>     this manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In short, they wait until /after/ someone has developed bad habits
</I>&gt;<i>     and then introduce version control and unit testing as an
</I>&gt;<i>     afterthought.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It seems to me that the /correct/ way to teach programming is to
</I>&gt;<i>     start with a little version control, then do a little unit
</I>&gt;<i>     testing, and then proceed to the coding.  Especially useful is to
</I>&gt;<i>     structure the course so that the users experience just /why/
</I>&gt;<i>     version control and unit tests are a good thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As such, I'm going to try to put together a course on learning to
</I>&gt;<i>     program PHP the right way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It starts off with learning a minimal number of git commands[you
</I>&gt;<i>     don't need to know them all, and there is no reason to confuse
</I>&gt;<i>     yourself at this point!  All you need are &quot;git clone...&quot;, &quot;git
</I>&gt;<i>     commit...&quot;, and &quot;git push...&quot; while not necessary is a nice to
</I>&gt;<i>     have.  This unit will include cloning an existing code repository
</I>&gt;<i>     on github, making a change, and commiting your change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The code should include a class or two /and/ some incomplete unit
</I>&gt;<i>     tests for said class.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The next step is learning some basic unit test commands, run the
</I>&gt;<i>     unit tests on the code to see them working, demonstration of how
</I>&gt;<i>     to run the checks so you can see what methods are not currently
</I>&gt;<i>     covered by unit tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Unit tests are fairly trivial bits of code, so the first
</I>&gt;<i>     introduction to coding will be to add the missing unit tests.
</I>&gt;<i>      Verify the addition.  Commit the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     After that, we can do the traditional &quot;hello world&quot; app....the
</I>&gt;<i>     RIGHT way, ie make a unit test for it, then implement it.  Verify
</I>&gt;<i>     the new code.  Commit the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Next up will be making some major functional changes to the code,
</I>&gt;<i>     extending it, expanding it, etc.  At this point, we should be
</I>&gt;<i>     doing some fairly radical, but simple, changes to the code where
</I>&gt;<i>     we will be deleting entire sets of logic and replacing them with
</I>&gt;<i>     new sets - including changing the unit tests first!  Verify the
</I>&gt;<i>     new code.  Commit the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Following all these changes, we will now have to undo some of the
</I>&gt;<i>     modifications and use the original code....  so a quick review now
</I>&gt;<i>     of how to use git to browse through previous commits, review
</I>&gt;<i>     differences in code, etc.  And of course, as always start with
</I>&gt;<i>     unit tests, verify the changes, commit the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As you can see from the above, this also explains /why/
</I>&gt;<i>     programming books suck so much.  It's a lot of extra verbage to go
</I>&gt;<i>     step by step through the testing/commit process - and programmers
</I>&gt;<i>     are by nature lazy!  So they skip it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm curious if there are any other items people think should be
</I>&gt;<i>     incorporated into this tutorial.
