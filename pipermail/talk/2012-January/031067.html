<PRE>hi Gary, to be honest I would argue that such things as Version Control and
Unit Testing do not really belong in a language-specific text-book or
tutorial. After all, one does not try to teach program control, binary
logic, control and data structures, and the like in a language-specific
text-book either, right?

I definitely *strongly* agree that programmers (the ones I come across, at
least) seem to learn a language (PHP, Ruby, etc), but don't seem to
understand much about the underlying or adjacent issues (version control,
unit testing are among those; but also such fundamental things as the
important differences between data-types, appropriate use of different
data-structures, performance optimization, etc)

However, all of these should be taught to programmers. One can know a
language inside-out, but without &quot;real technical knowledge&quot;, a programmer
can only go so far...

just my two cents...

P.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As such, I'm going to try to put together a course on learning to program
</I>&gt;<i> PHP the right way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It starts off with learning a minimal number of git commands[you don't
</I>&gt;<i> need to know them all, and there is no reason to confuse yourself at this
</I>&gt;<i> point!  All you need are &quot;git clone...&quot;, &quot;git commit...&quot;, and &quot;git push...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> while not necessary is a nice to have.  This unit will include cloning an
</I>&gt;<i> existing code repository on github, making a change, and commiting your
</I>&gt;<i> change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The code should include a class or two /and/ some incomplete unit tests
</I>&gt;<i> for said class.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next step is learning some basic unit test commands, run the unit
</I>&gt;<i> tests on the code to see them working, demonstration of how to run the
</I>&gt;<i> checks so you can see what methods are not currently covered by unit tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unit tests are fairly trivial bits of code, so the first introduction to
</I>&gt;<i> coding will be to add the missing unit tests.  Verify the addition.  Commit
</I>&gt;<i> the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After that, we can do the traditional &quot;hello world&quot; app....the RIGHT way,
</I>&gt;<i> ie make a unit test for it, then implement it.  Verify the new code.
</I>&gt;<i>  Commit the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next up will be making some major functional changes to the code,
</I>&gt;<i> extending it, expanding it, etc.  At this point, we should be doing some
</I>&gt;<i> fairly radical, but simple, changes to the code where we will be deleting
</I>&gt;<i> entire sets of logic and replacing them with new sets - including changing
</I>&gt;<i> the unit tests first!  Verify the new code.  Commit the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Following all these changes, we will now have to undo some of the
</I>&gt;<i> modifications and use the original code....  so a quick review now of how
</I>&gt;<i> to use git to browse through previous commits, review differences in code,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.  And of course, as always start with unit tests, verify the changes,
</I>&gt;<i> commit the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see from the above, this also explains /why/ programming books
</I>&gt;<i> suck so much.  It's a lot of extra verbage to go step by step through the
</I>&gt;<i> testing/commit process - and programmers are by nature lazy!  So they skip
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm curious if there are any other items people think should be
</I>&gt;<i> incorporated into this tutorial.
