<PRE>Once again, though, Gary, I think you're mixing two separate issues.
Details about escaping &amp; sql-injection have no place in sample-code, except
in that chapter that has to do with these issues.

That said, if you want to write a book about PHP that goes through the
lengths of outlining source-control, unit-testing, etc, all the best to
you. Honestly.

But then again, what about data-structures, standard algos, etc? How many
times have you seen &quot;good&quot; programmers fail to use appropriate search or
sort algorithms, or have no idea on how to use indices or hashing tables? A
*really* good programmer should know all of these things, and MUCH more.

</I>&gt;<i> Since a lot of people will go directly from the example code to using that

</I>&gt;<i> version control system[even CVS] is fine.  However, since the commands that
</I>&gt;<i> will be gone over are primarily clone, add, commit, and maybe push - they
</I>&gt;<i> are simply commands with equivalents in all the version control systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Git simply has the benefit of github, so part of the instructional code can
</I>&gt;<i> be a github repo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also when your learning to code, your adopting habits.  If your habits are
</I>&gt;<i> jumping straight to the code and not committing changes and testing, then
</I>&gt;<i> it is just that much harder to learn about it later.

</I>&gt;<i> Though I do admit calling &quot;the right way&quot; is controversial - I simply

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing that has annoyed me more and more over time is the way books

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They all start off with &quot;Hello World&quot; and then progress slowly form there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to more and more complicated things.  I've noticed that even Ruby books,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the poster child for unit testing, proceed in this manner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In short, they wait until /after/ someone has developed bad habits and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then introduce version control and unit testing as an afterthought.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that the /correct/ way to teach programming is to start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a little version control, then do a little unit testing, and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proceed to the coding.  Especially useful is to structure the course so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the users experience just /why/ version control and unit tests are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As such, I'm going to try to put together a course on learning to program
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PHP the right way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It starts off with learning a minimal number of git commands[you don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to know them all, and there is no reason to confuse yourself at this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point!  All you need are &quot;git clone...&quot;, &quot;git commit...&quot;, and &quot;git push...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while not necessary is a nice to have.  This unit will include cloning an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing code repository on github, making a change, and commiting your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The code should include a class or two /and/ some incomplete unit tests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for said class.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The next step is learning some basic unit test commands, run the unit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tests on the code to see them working, demonstration of how to run the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checks so you can see what methods are not currently covered by unit tests.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unit tests are fairly trivial bits of code, so the first introduction to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coding will be to add the missing unit tests.  Verify the addition.  Commit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After that, we can do the traditional &quot;hello world&quot; app....the RIGHT way,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ie make a unit test for it, then implement it.  Verify the new code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Commit the changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Next up will be making some major functional changes to the code,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extending it, expanding it, etc.  At this point, we should be doing some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fairly radical, but simple, changes to the code where we will be deleting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entire sets of logic and replacing them with new sets - including changing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the unit tests first!  Verify the new code.  Commit the changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Following all these changes, we will now have to undo some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modifications and use the original code....  so a quick review now of how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use git to browse through previous commits, review differences in code,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc.  And of course, as always start with unit tests, verify the changes,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit the changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As you can see from the above, this also explains /why/ programming books
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suck so much.  It's a lot of extra verbage to go step by step through the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testing/commit process - and programmers are by nature lazy!  So they skip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm curious if there are any other items people think should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incorporated into this tutorial.
