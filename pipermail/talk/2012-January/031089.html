<PRE>As someone who started by writing machine code (not assembly, bits - and 
in octal, which was the big thing back when we wrote code on stone with 
wooden chisels), I can say that's very true.  I've sen some C code that, 
when it was compiled to assembly, was absolutely terrible.  (And don't 
get me started on the massive bug in version 2 of Microsoft's C 
compiler.)  But with PHP, you're writing data, not code.  Yes, it looks 
like code, but it's just data to the PHP interpreter which is running 
it.  The efficiency at the assembly level really comes from writing an 
efficient PHP interpreter.  If that's inefficient, the best PHP code 
isn't going to execute fast.

The other, and I think more important, considerations are SQL and 
Javascript  They'll impact the user's experience a lot more than the PHP 
code will.  If you do a search on a huge table using LIKE or not using a 
proper index, it may be done when you get back from lunch - in Paris.  
That has nothing to do with PHP.  Neither did the fact that some JS ran 
50 times slower in IE5 than it did in FF1.

You have to write efficient JS and efficient SQL.  Inefficient PHP isn't 
elegant, but it won't impact the user nearly as much as a SQL join that 
forces a linear search on a table with 10 million records.

And that's not stuff you teach in a CS course - that's the difference 
between an entry level programmer and someone with bloody fingers.

But yes, if you're writing on the metal, assembly can be a lot more 
efficient at runtime than a 3GL.  (Not at writing time, though - printf 
is a lot more efficient to write than poking bytes to the screen memory 
by hand, or even sending a string to an API.)
