Chris,

This borders on academic heresy, but maybe a community colleges should
offer AOS (Associate in Occupational Studies) degrees in *addition* to
Associates in arts and Sciences. Briarcliffe, and probably may other for
profit universities did that, but if it was offered at a school that also
has Associates in Arts and Sciences as opposed to AOSes and &quot;diplomas,&quot;
there would be some more vigor and quality in the program, and the one or
two electives taken would be better taught. Obviously, the AOS should only
be marketed to non-traditional (25+) students and those absolutely sure
they don't want a bachelors.

I  was going to make an argument that assembly might not be needed at the
associates level, but writing this has made me question that myself.
However, I think its more important to be able to read assembly than write
assembly, so maybe it should be taught that way. One or two lessons where
you write some stuff to appreciate the syntax, and the rest would be
&quot;compile this code, step through the assembly&quot; Seeing different calling
conventions in action will probably teach students a lot, and honestly I'd
probably audit a course taught that way.

Justin
