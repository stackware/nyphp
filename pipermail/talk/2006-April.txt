Yeah, and I bet that M$ can make it bloat.

All,

This "meetup" is not affiliated with New York PHP in any way, even though
Beau would apparently like people to think it is.  Beau has quite a
reputation around the user groups in the area.  I would recommend steering
clear of providing your information to him.

Beau,

It quite amusing, actually, that you setup a meetup - and named it New York
PHP Meetup - so that you can augment your headhunting work.  And what's
better is that you are looking for organizer because you're not in NY
anymore.

He was a day early, but I think the April Fool's award goes to Beau.  

Anyway, Beau, you have been moderated on NYPHP lists due to EAB (excessive
annoying behavior).

Happy fools day,

I was looking over these slides, http://talks.php.net/show/yul/ and
found (among other great things) http_load.  I've installed and run it
and I am now looking for ways to 'bring up my numbers'.  

I know many, many, many things influence performance.. but.. the above
example seems like good advice.  I haven't seen much talk about The
Alternative PHP Cache (APC) opcode cache on this list.  Is anyone
making use of it? 

I also found xdebug (xdebug.org), but have not installed it.  Can
anyone thumbs up/down on that one?

I'm using the apc for opcode caching. I use a lot of includes per
request, and I haven't seen it do anything gnarly. I haven't bothered
to use it for shared memory yet, but I'm sure that would speed things
up _a lot_.

How is http_load different from ab (the Apache benchmark tool)?

And what's the Callgrind business? I'd like to see a tutorial on that.

so.. 'not gnarly' is a +1? [grin]

> How is http_load different from ab (the Apache benchmark tool)?

yea, I was curious why he chose http_load over the apache tool.  I ran
the same test on with tools and got different results.  It appears (in
my un-scientific study) ab gives better resutls.  

> And what's the Callgrind business? I'd like to see a tutorial on that.

I've seen it elsewhere, pretty cool; but it looks to be based on
linux-specific valgrind. http://valgrind.org/ and the kde-specific:
http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex

I use xdebug for profiling.  I used to use APD
<http://pecl.php.net/package/apd> but (afaik) it doesn't work in PHP5 :(

Aside from a few minor annoyances, overall I have been very happy with
xdebug and the cachegrind output.  Although I use Gnome, I have come to
terms with KCacheGrind ;-)  <http://www.xdebug.org/docs-profiling2.php>
I find it very enlightening to actually see where your bottlenecks are
as opposed to *assuming*.

Yep, it does its job well. Yahoo also uses it.

(The creator of APC lurks on this list.)

I have more experience with APD, but I think both have strong 
reputations and are reasonably well maintained.

The performance gurus recommend keeping your include trees reasonably 
small. Opcode caches don't erase that performance penalty.

There are lots of good docs here:

http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindDocs

Slides 22 - 24 of this talk give you a peek at using KCachegrind with APD:

http://www.omniti.com/~george/talks/Profiling-phpworks-2004.pdf

If you're interested in APD itself, these notes are really good:

Hmmm, I just tried APD with PHP5.1.2 and it works. Yay.  For whatever
reason, I though it wasn't working with PHP5 (was getting seg faults)
about a year ago, thats when I found xdebug.  I am glad to know I was
wrong and can use APD again! :-)

This has been a problem in the computer field for decades.  Many 
language developers have not understood the importance of precision in 
this way.  I agree that it would be good to have a type of number that 
is treated as fixed.

In C++ this can be addressed by operator overloading.  But PHP doesn't 
have operator overloading so it would have to be done with more 
non-visually pleasing object methods without a change to the language.

Has anyone here dealt with php encoders? I am looking into using one, and
wanted to go with the best, most affordable one that works without having to
install anything on the system level for customers to use the software.

Any thoughts/experience?

I use ionCube (http://www.ioncube.com/) at work and it works very well.

It's trivial to bundle the loader with your software, so that the user
doesn't have to install anything to run the encoded files.

One caveat is that if the user has an older version of the loader
already installed on their system it will need to be upgraded or removed
 before the files encoded with the newer encoder will work.

I'd been meaning to ask a similar question.  In particular, I currently use Turck mmcache and have been planning on switching to its successor, Eaccelerator (necessary if one wants to upgrade to more recent PHP versions).  Does anyone have any experience, or recommendations for or against?

Thanks,

Ken

... another caveat would be that it only works with php4 (or did last
time I checked).

Have they fixed the incompatiblity issues when Zend encoder is already 
installed? I recal a load ordering issue that seemed simple enough but 
in practice caused all sorts of headaches.

The only time we've run into a problem was on a machine running a very
old version of the zend encoder, which was solved after an upgrade.

I've only used it with PHP4, but the current version (6.5) does seem to
support PHP5.

I have 2 servers co-lo'd at Xand and have had a great experience.  
Awesome support, 100% uptime, secure.

I was at "The Bunker" run by Savvy Networks but would not recommend  
them.

Maybe you and your office hold certain responsibilities regarding web site
display nits on client sites and apps.

Recently downloaded IE7 Beta 2 and it is (at least at this time)
demonstrating differing display characteristics from IE6 possibly altering
divs and frames presentation. I think might be related to how IE is actually
attempting to handle web pages based on the DOCTYPE: transitional vs.
strict, etc.

Additionally, IE7 has a heaping of fresh chrome and menus have gone off and
sidestepped their original locations. 

Under Tools>Internet Options>Advanced, the sections Browsing and Security
may be of worthwhile note including a default Phishing Filter and some
possible upgrade tomfoolery with SSL and TLS.

Default install, of course, saw IE6 subsumed by IE7. Though documentation
claims that IE7 will go peaceably via Add/Remove Programs. And, lo, it is
there.

If you are interested you can follow this on  the serious CSS 
lists/forums. Ever since IE7 started Beta they have been picking it 
apart and it is, indeed, rather ugly so far.

On April 1, someone released a "perfect style sheet" which was actually 
a simple all-table layout for all versions of IE, with no-layout for 
everyone else. No more issues!

Argh.

Once again all clues point to session wierdness on Windows.

Has anyone ever actually identified specific problems with sessions on 
Windows vs. TheRestOfTheWorld when doing dev work using XAMPP or EasyPHP?

This time it's smarty related.... SmartyValidator works fine on any 
linux/bsd host but chokes on Windows and as usual I went through all the 
work of checking paths and roots and path separators and PHP versions 
and testing the smarty install and yet the problem persists.

thanks for any ideas or even external validation that winblows is 
useless for dev work.

There are SEVERAL things that could be out of kilter.

* Is session.save_path being overridden to something that doesn't 
exist on your windows box?

Thanks Dan. This is helpful. I checked the php config but not whether it 
was being overwritten.

Another good point but ok for now (problem exists even with my 
dangerously unsecured test install of IE )

No, and I can see session files.

Nah.

Yes, it was off but turning it on didn't change anything and I was 
already seing sessions so not the problem.

Maybe I am wrong about sessions being the culprit... Smarty not seeing 
IDs as validated:

*Warning*: Smarty error: validate: validator id 'p_user' is not 
registered. in *C:\...**a\libs\smarty\Smarty.class.php

even though I can see the ID inside the SmartyValidate cookie. This is 
code that works fine on every Linux box I've tried and some Windows but 
not *my* Windows setup under XAMP or EasyPHP.

Thanks anyway for the ideas.

Damned if it wasn't too strange, so I looked externally and sure 
enough...a new firewall was blocking 3rd party cookies.

Thanks again for the guidance.

Hi.
Forgive me the stupid question, have you tried CTRL+SPACE to activate the
code assist?
What version of eclipse have you downloaded?

Have you heard of the Web Tools Project, it's a version with all we need to
make websites (hand coded, of course).
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drops/R-1.0.1-200602171228/

Enjoy, it has worked fine for me, although we must not expect the
operability of the zend IDE, but hey! it's FREE!

Al.

I tried using XCode for a while before Jeff Knight finally convinced
me that the Zend IDE was the way to go on Mac. Despite the bloat it
generally stays out of the way, and if you take the time to change
some of the poor key-mapping and syntax-coloring choices, it's a great
editor.

Well, okay, the interface takes up a little too much real-estate on a
12" PowerBook, but that's life.

XCode has a nice enough interface, and it will make your code look
good on screen, but it's ultimately the wrong tool for the job...
unless you're mixing Objective-C into your php project, of course. ;-)

Chris:

I have Zend IDE Professional as well, but I seldom use it.

Surprisingly enough, I use GoLive for the Mac and program directly on 
my host. However, GoLive has some minor issues with function 
coloring, minor editing annoyances, and it occasionally loses track 
of what it should upload (it often looks at two files with the same 
name as being the same even though they reside in different folders). 
However, I know what to lookout for and it works well for me.

I tried XCode, but it's far too much -- it's like driving a thumbtack 
with a sledge hammer. I want something like me, simple. :-)

Why?  too much IDE?  I'm contemplating a purchase as my trial is about 
to expire and I've loved it so far.  Just wondered.

I use bluefish for a fast and simple editor [on linux]. Looks as if it 
also works for Mac OSX:

Maybe it's too much for me.

I started out hard coding everything in a text editor and running it 
on my host -- if I remember correctly, some time ago, the IDE will 
run on the host IF something was installed and it wasn't -- and I 
could get the host to do anything, so I gave up.

Maybe I should review it again. But, what I want is something that 
doesn't run on my machine, but rather something that I can see in 
real time on the net instead of preview in browser.

Oh well... back to basics.

Message-ID: <003a01c65d96$8e6d8ea0$68e4a144@Rubicon>

I believe, XSL Transformations (XSLT) is a correct method for achieving your
end, i.e. use XSL to format and sort the XML.
PHP 4.1+ XSLT library will let you do roughly so...

$xsltHnd = xslt_create();
xslt_set_base($xsltHnd,'');
$html =  xslt_process($xsltHnd, 'my_listings.xml',
'my_listings_format.xsl');
echo $html;


Above, the XML param is your XML file. The XSL file contains a mixture of
XHTML, CSS and XSL.
The XSL allows you to sort and format XML quite effectively.

Your XSL file will contain code like the following snippets:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
<xsl:output method="html" omit-xml-declaration="yes"/>

<xsl:template match="/ads">
  <xsl:apply-templates select="ad">
    <xsl:sort select="category"/>
  </xsl:apply-templates>
</xsl:template>


<xsl:template match="ad">
<xsl:choose>
	<xsl:when test="url[.!='']">	
		<td align="left" height="28" valign="top">
		<xsl:element name="a">
			<xsl:attribute name="href"><xsl:value-of
select="@url"/></xsl:attribute>
				<xsl:element name="img">
					<xsl:attribute
name="src">images/ads/<xsl:text></xsl:text><xsl:value-of
select="title"/></xsl:attribute>
					<xsl:attribute
name="border">0</xsl:attribute>
				</xsl:element>
		</xsl:element>
		</td>
	</xsl:when>
	<xsl:otherwise>
		<td align="left" height="28" valign="top">
		<img src="../images/spacer.gif" />
		</td>
	</xsl:otherwise>
</xsl:choose>
</xsl:template> 


</xsl:stylesheet>


Above shows very roughly the technique for using XSL to sort XML and then
push the XML data into some XHTML to create a hyperlinked thumbnail image
for display in the browser. 

Now that is just to give you an idea. 

This technique, of course, has a learning curve. You need to look up PHP
XML/XSLT tutorials and samples on the web and get familiar with XSL in
general. Particularly you need to grasp XSL templates and how to apply to
XML data.

Again, this is just one avenue but once you got it, you can apply this
approach on many tasks with few changes.

Otherwise, look at PHP array sort techniques at:

If im not mistaken in *theory* this is exactly the type of work that  
XQuery was made for ...

Your query would look something similar to:

{
      for $ad in doc("ads.xml")//ad
      order by $ad/category
      return $ad/title
}

Looks beautiful and much cleaner eh?  The problem is no library  
support whatsoever on the PHP side, all implementations have been  
Java based ...

There is a preliminary library here:
http://phpxmlclasses.sourceforge.net/show_doc.php? 
class=class_xquery_lite.html

But no sorting support as of yet and Im not sure if those libraries  
are even in active development.  I also do not beleive Simple XML has  
this capability, only simple Xpath.

For reference, here is a 3-pack zipped download that contains a working XSLT
task sample:
http://www.pswebcode.com/samples/XML-XSLTSample.zip

This task reads apartment listings from an XML file, sorts them by price and
displays them on a complete XHTML page.

The files included are:

listings_list.php
[A PHP file that transforms an XML file with an XSL file.]
listings_list.xml
[A very short demo XML data file.]
listings_list.xsl
[A complete XSLT file containing sample XHTML, CSS and XSL that transforms
the XML.]

Hello,

I am working on a web page that lists some ads stored in an XML file and I'm
having trouble with figuring out how to sort the listings by their
"category" element. Currently I pull the "ad" elements from the XML into an
array and print out the HTML list of ads in a non-sorted manner. I'd like it
to print out with a header for the category followed by a list of ads in
that category. I'm not sure how to code it though. Any help would be
appreciated. Below is a snippet from the XML file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<ads>
<ad>
    <franchise>test</franchise>
    <category>Food</category>
    <title>Test 1</title>
    <url>testpage1.pdf</url>
</ad>
<ad>

Peter,
 
Thanks so much for the XSL examples, that definitely puts me going in the
right direction I think. I was narrowly stuck on a PHP coded solution and
forgot all about XSL and XSLTs. It's been awhile but I'll brush up on that.
 
Again Thanks!

If the host is local (a server on your LAN) you can use VNC/Remote
Desktop/X-Windows to edit remotely.

At work I use Cygwin's free X Server for Windows to control a remote
copy of the ide on my workstation. But there's nothing easy about
setting that up if you don't know what you're doing already.

A better approach for remote servers is to use WebDAV or some network
filesystem so that you can work on the remote files as if they were
local. I've been experimenting with Samba over SSH, which could be
great except that there are no off-the-shelf apps that do it (to my
knowledge).

I used BBEdit on Mac and it was OK.  Why don't you use pico, nano, vi,
emacs, etc and edit remotely?

you will need sshfs installed on you system, but this is a safe and easy
way to mount remote file systems over ssh.
http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html If you want to automate the mount
using fstab, you will need to set up key authentication so a password is
not needed.  

Once that is set up you can run:
mount -t sshfs user at host /mnt/myfiles

FYI -- If you plan on mounting a Server 2003 share using samba, you will
need CIFS support either built in to your kernel or as a module.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Problem With Making Cookies
Message-ID: <c575e07a32e90.32e90c575e07a@nyroc.rr.com>

I have a script that creates a cookie. The text for the cookie is
created like this (I previously used implode and got the exact same
problem I'm about to describe):
$cookiedata = $infoarray[0].'#'.$infoarray[1].'#'.$infoarray[2];

However, when I actually check the data inside the cookie, it's saved
not with pound signs in between the data, but instead with %23. I've
tried using commas, new line characters, hyphen, and all of them return
some kind of % character, usually %2C. Is there something I'm not doing
correctly?

PHP.net says to use implode and a character as the glue, but it doesn't
matter what character I choose for the glue, it always gets changed into
a % character (I've only tried characters that are pratical, letters and
numbers will not be pratical for me as glue) and I can't retrieve the data.

What can I do?

You can use "_" underscore character in place of other special characters
like # and all it might be encoding them to ASCII values for Browser query
string values.

You should definitely check out implode().

That's something setcookie() does. You can use header() if you want to 
have precise control over your Set-Cookie header. Try this example:

<?php
 

$info = array();
$info[] = 'one';
$info[] = 'two';
$info[] = 'three';
 

$cookie = implode('#', $info);
 

header("Set-Cookie: foo=$cookie");
setcookie('bar', $cookie);
 

?>

The headers I see are:

Set-Cookie: foo=one#two#three
Set-Cookie: bar=one%23two%23three

Hope that helps.

Ok, so this is a little off base -- not really php related.
 
But I just stumbled on this company: http://www.alertbot.com/ for remote
monitoring. 
 
Seems pretty cool. Is this old hat? Are there lots of companies that do
this? Do you just perform the monitoring using your own servers?
Thoughts? Suggestions?

I guess it's pretty easy to create montioring tools on your own, and
probably perl has a zillion of them cooked up already (perl is great
at that kind of thing).

Here's a big list, lots of free tools.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Web Site Monitoring


Ok, so this is a little off base -- not really php related.
 
But I just stumbled on this company: http://www.alertbot.com/ for remote
monitoring. 
 
Seems pretty cool. Is this old hat? Are there lots of companies that do
this? Do you just perform the monitoring using your own servers? Thoughts?
Suggestions?

Actually, I had been using implode as stated.

On another note, _ worked although I continued to have a lot of trouble.
While I could extract information from the cookie, my script seemed to
be refusing to use it until I noticed that I had done a test on part of
the cookie which should be (and infact was) 1, checking to see if it was
not equal to 1 using !=. Apparently, even though it was evaluating 1 !=
1 it was getting "true." Setting it to 1 == 1 now returns false. I'm not
sure why, but at least it works properly now.

Thanks,
-Joe

I'm sure it's going to be something really obvious, but for now I just
can't seem to figure out what it is.

I'm getting the following error:
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING

The line of code is:
$checkreplies = "SELECT posts.postid, posts.subject, posts.body,
posts.created, users.userid, users.username, users.aim, users.created,
users.admin FROM posts, users WHERE posts.postid = \"$_GET[id]\" AND
posts.userid = users.userid AND posts.replyto = $_GET[postid] LIMIT
".($pagecount-1)*10-1.", 10";

>From what I can gather, it sounds like I misused a double quote or
misplaced a peroid. But looking at the code, I can't see where I did
either wrong.

Anyhelp would be appreciated.

Thanks,
-Joe

Doesn't SQl normally require single quotes aroung string comparison? like
this:

$q = "select * from sometable where column='$_GET['jerry']'"

Actually, I have no problems with using double quotes on the command
line (and in PHP scripts) with MySQL. In addition, that would not return
a PHP Parse error, it would return a MySQL error from the database (the
code would actually run, a line from the database citing the error would
be inserted in the middle of my HTML).

I'd also make sure that the variables are not returning something that is  
throwing off the SQL command - like adding an extra ' or ", etc.

I don't think I've every used double quotes in sql, and why not covert
this to a variable value ahead of time? Looks a bit scarry. And then
just stick that in. At least it makes it a bit easier to debug, and
more readable.

$id = $_GET[id];
$start = (($pagecount-1)*10)-1;

etc.

Adding your $start line fixed the problem.

Once again, MySQL has no problem with double or single quotes. You can
use them interchangably. I've done this both via PHP and on the command
line and never had any problems with it.

I still don't understand what I had done wrong in my previous code. What
there would have returned that error, any ideas?

Thanks,

To get your original code to work, the ($pagecount-1)*10-1 expression needs
to be in parentheses: (($pagecount-1)*10-1)

Actually, after I had given it a look I was begining to think that too.
The 1 looked off right next to the peroid.

Thanks for confirming that for me Andy.

For reference, the PHP order of operations:
    http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.php#language.operators.precedence

+ - and . operators are all equal, thus your problem.

It sounds like you've fixed your immediate problem, but I'd like to 
stress the risk in letting a user modify your SQL query like this. Every 
time you use $_GET['id'] or $_GET['postid'], it's like handing over your 
keyboard to the user - you never know what he will type.

Doesn't matter. I do tests on all the data for validity before I try to
do anything with it. In this case, postid is checked against the
database for a valid post id (that also isn't a response to a post)
before ANY actions are taken. Same is done for the page number. The page
number is checked to make sure there will actually be posts on that page
before any action is taken. Thus, a user can type whatever he/she wants
for either, a script will react appropriately.

Hi
You can try with this too...

$checkreplies = "SELECT posts.postid, posts.subject, posts.body,
posts.created, users.userid, users.username, users.aim, users.created,
users.admin FROM posts, users WHERE posts.postid ='".$_GET['id']."' AND
posts.userid = users.userid AND posts.replyto ='".$_GET['postid']."' LIMIT
".($pagecount-1)*10-1.", 10";

IAlsoAgree at stny.rr.com wrote: I'm sure it's going to be something really obvious, but for now I just
can't seem to figure out what it is.

I'm getting the following error:
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING

The line of code is:
$checkreplies = "SELECT posts.postid, posts.subject, posts.body,
posts.created, users.userid, users.username, users.aim, users.created,
users.admin FROM posts, users WHERE posts.postid = \"$_GET[id]\" AND
posts.userid = users.userid AND posts.replyto = $_GET[postid] LIMIT
".($pagecount-1)*10-1.", 10";

>From what I can gather, it sounds like I misused a double quote or
misplaced a peroid. But looking at the code, I can't see where I did
either wrong.

Anyhelp would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Yes, reason is pretty obvious that you have misused quotes as well your  
didn't close that mathematical expression with parenthesis that determines  
limit part of sql.

I strongly recommend you to first learn how to write php statements with  
proper syntax. For that you must understand what is exact use of " and '  
in writing any statement. " is used to evaluate any given php, in fact in  
most of programming languages, statement while ' used to take given  
statement or part of statement as it is. Same applies to mysql and most of  
databases as well. In your case you have used " everywhere even when it is  
not required at all. So in context of php, your statement could look like  
below.

$checkreplies='SELECT posts.postid, posts.subject, posts.body,
posts.created, users.userid, users.username, users.aim, users.created,
users.admin FROM posts, users WHERE posts.postid='.$_GET['id'].' AND
posts.userid=users.userid AND posts.replyto='.$_GET['postid'].' LIMIT
'.(($pagecount - 1) * 10 - 1).',10';

Some other points to be kept in mind while using arrays is that you should  
always enclose keys of all array by necessary " or ' depending upon same  
rule mentioned above. So $_GET[id] should be $_GET['id'], otherwise if key  
"id" of this array is defined as constant somewhere in your script, GET  
array will use it's value as key and you will get different result than  
what you expect. And of course also try to consider tips given by Chris  
and Lee.

I hope YouAlsoAgree at above suggestions. :)

Thanks

You are trying to concatenate a numer with strings.
Try this one:

$checkreplies = "SELECT
                    posts.postid,
                    posts.subject,
                    posts.body,
                    posts.created,
                    users.userid,
                    users.username,
                    users.aim,
                    users.created,
                    users.admin
                FROM posts, users
                WHERE posts.postid = '".$_GET["id"]."'
                AND    posts.userid = users.userid
                AND posts.replyto = '".$_GET["postid"]."'
                LIMIT ".strval(($pagecount-1)*10-1).", 10";

Using strval() does the trick :D

hope this helps...

the syntax error has to do with $_GET[id] and $_GET[postid]... 

 WHERE posts.postid = \"{$_GET['id']}\" AND  posts.userid = users.userid AND posts.replyto = {$_GET['postid']}  would fix the syntax error

MySQL may not have any problems storing double or single quotes, but 
you can't always exchange them in a query and say the same thing.

Double quoted strings are subject to variable substitution and escape 
sequence handling, while single quotes are not.

Hello all:

I am having a problem trying to get a text field get
its name in a while loop like this expense_cat1,
expense_cat2 ... etc. here's a snip of the code:

while( $row = mysql_fetch_array( $category ) )

  echo( "<tr><td>" . $row['expenses_cat_desc'] . 
       "</td><td><input type=text name=expense_cat" .

}

I pass this to another page and try to print it using
$_POST['expense_cat1'] and is giving me an empty
string. 

Now, I check phpinfo() and the variable name gets
created as:

$_POST['expense_cat1</td>']

I don't know how I can get around this. What other
function can I use to get this working correctly. 


Thank you in advanced for your help.

You must set the value on the input.

 while( $row = mysql_fetch_array( $category ) )
{
 echo(
    "<tr><td>" .$row['expenses_cat_desc'] ."</td><td><input type=text
name=expense_cat value=" . $row['expenses_cat_number'] . " /></td></tr>");
}

And learn your syntax too...

And by that I am sure you meant to say, "Don't use parenthesis with

One, possibly two, problem(s).

First, 
$row['expenses_cat_number'] . ("</td></tr>");
                              ^
Where is this from? Looks like unmatched parens.
Then, the immediate problem, the line should read like:

$row['expenses_cat_number'] . "></td></tr>");

You need to add the '>' to close the <input> tag.

The parenthesis were not in the code. I added them

You should probably also check out this PHundamentals article:

http://www.nyphp.org/phundamentals/storingretrieving.php

You'll find some useful information there about properly escaping data.

Hello again:

I'm passing an array to a page and can't figure out
how to access each row with $_POST['array_name'].

How can I browse each row for ie:

print array_name[1]
print array_name[2]

etc....

What do you mean by "passing am array to a page".

Is there a form involved? If so please post the script that generates the form.

If you're trying to get php to create an array from your a form field...
a very common mistake is forgetting the brackets in the form field name.

If you leave out the brackets, all you'll get is the last selected item/option, not all of them.

e.g.
<select multiple size=5 name=my_ops[]>
.....
</select>

Yes. There is a form involved. I found out the
solution after searching for about an hour. This was
enough: $_POST['array_name'][1]

Removing what doesn't work is OK, but the hard part is putting in

I recently saw a part time php programming position offered on guru 
for 4-5 hours per day and it paid $300 per month (no lie).

Well!  A good question for sure, I just moved to upstate New York from
NYC. I'm paying less rent for a great 1 bedroom with river view then
Bangalore, and I've been doing PHP things almost 8 years. Soooooo....
pricing is hard. Really depends on your expectations. Working for
yourself is BRUTAL, but you get the benefits.

A rough range?  $35 - $75 per hour. BUT I really think  per project
pricing is the way to go. The hourly thing generally limits you. After
you spend 10 hours on a bug, it's hard to charge the client for bug
fixes on your part or homework you have to do. They are  usually not
too happy about that.

I'm sure you'll get some interesting answers from the list.

That sounds perfect for a guru. The trick with a job like that is to
do everything they want in 1 hour, and spend the rest of the time
moonlighting on better-paying gigs.

David, ask for $100/hr, but accept $80,000 a year.

Good luck, and welcome to NYC.

If you are just looking to store arbitrary data in the cookie, you might 
want to serialize() the array before storing it. That should take care 
of any conflicting delimiter issues.

Heh, I am surprised it took that many responses to arrive at the correct 
answer. 

Adding to Chris' comment about sql security, If your query used to 
validate the id and postid are formatted in the same manner (including 
{$_GET['id']} in the query), someone could inject a query into yours... 
Something disasterous might be if the hacker manually posted with an $id 
value "1; DELETE * FROM USERS; select * from posts,users where 1=1"

To be safe, I try to keep all my id's as integers and do something like:
$id=intval($_GET['id']);

Not sure what Chris is smoking, but $300 per month isn't even enough for
1 hour per day, IMO!

I concur.  Depending on level of expertise and skillset, I'd say rock
bottom is $70k, on up to $120k or more per year.

The monthly NYPHP meetings are a great place to network and have a good
time.  Good luck David.

This is where I have an amazing advatage by living out of NYC.

This Summer, for $850 a month I can get a great 1 bedroom, a car (with
insurance), and  a months worth of food, with lots left over.  Of
course I have to go to Canada for Sushi!  (Ok, add taxes, etc, but
still a heck of a bargain!).

Movie night?  $3.50.  Just saw V for Vendeta, but I'll have to wait
till I get to NYC to see the new Bjork film, that for sure will not
make it up here. But hey, Netflix, FedEx and Paypal can save the day.

It is very, very rural here (20 mins from the Canadian border).
However we have 4 - 5 mbs wireless connections everywhere. 2 years ago
there was nothing I'm told.

And I'm sure I can match a $75K -  $120,000K a year NYC programmer
with portfolio and skills.  Diving into Ajax/JSON now!

Incorrect.

"I strongly recommend you to first learn how to write php statements with 
proper syntax. For that you must understand what is exact use of " and ' 
in writing any statement." -Anirudh Zala

This seems a tad insulting for no apparent reason. My choice of using
double quotes may not be neccessary, but makes the code a LOT easier to
read and easier to write.

So $_GET[id] should be $_GET['id']

I'd suggest that you "learn how to write php statements with proper
syntax" before telling me to do so.

For those that don't already know: when you use double quotes in PHP,
you CAN'T include the single quotes for an array unless you put the
array in brackets. Check http://www.php.net/ for further details on
including arrays in double quotes.

Thus, inside of double quotes, you need to do it as I have done (or as
{$_GET['id']}).

The problem was my code was lacking a pair of outer quotation marks
around the entire mathmatical operation. I used a different method to
get rid of the ".expression." I was having, but it still worked.

Thanks anyway though,
-Joe

Don't know about Zend studio but we had similar problem in Quanta editor,  
after changing encoding to "cp 1252" it started working properly, you may  
try this if it is available in Zend editor. Also try to copy paste those  
letters from any material or website to check whether it is problem with  
key board or not, because sometimes som european language characters have  
problems with key board.

If all you care about is having a cheap standard of
living and still being in a good job market, you
should try Denver, where I just moved from. For $760 a
month I have a 900sq ft luxury 2 bedroom. Food and
insurance are cheap too, thats all relative to NYC.

Bah.  Do like I do: Pay too much to live in boulder, but work from home
most of the time.  Drive a beater because you don't need commute.  Walk
to the trailhead when you need to get the blood flowing.

It takes a pretty important meeting to get me south of LoDo on 25.

I don't think there is any relief available. I went back and forth with
Zend tech support on this a while ago. They say it's Java's fault. (I'm
paraphrasing, but essentially that's my understanding.)

I'd give my left nut for $70k per year. Last year I was actually

Your coding style and security practices are abysmal.  You need to 
quote the HTML attribute values and escape the database output:

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($category)) {
   echo '<tr><td>' . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_desc'])
       . '</td><td><input type="text" name="expense_cat'
       . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number'])
       . '" value="" /></td></tr>' . "\n";
}

If I may interject -- without anyone throwing spears my way.

I think the big question isn't "what is the going rate", it's what is
your value proposition and what do you want to be when you grow up. Pro
baseball player and astronaut do not count.

As someone who has been on this group for about a year, had a fine time
at the Zend conference, hired a 15 year old programmer, coded a lot
myself and enjoy being way to geeky if allowed, tried a few flakey
freelancers, looked at very capable, but expensive Yankees, and finally
settled on that evil word -- offshore, STOP focusing on price. You will
never, ever be able to compete on price. Do you want to be a laborer or
the master of your destiny?

Focus on value. And simply FOCUS. Look at Chris Shiflett. I actually
have no idea how or if he makes a decent living, but I would bet he is
not offering his services for $500 to build Mama's Awesome yoyo website.
By focusing on security, he has separated himself from the pack.

I have looked at hundreds of designers and programmers over the past
year. Here's the story: 50% are musicians, artists and security guards
that can amazingly program too. 45% are unfocused programmers that will
do what the customer wants. Want me to make you a web site -- sure? Want
me to whip you up a pizza -- I can do that too. Than there's the 5% that
know what their strength is. No...I'm not a graphic designer. No...I
don't do Cold fusion. Etc. I have even seen guys that ONLY focus on CSS.

If I were trying to make a living programming, I would try to find a
single area where I can be that expert -- and command a price based upon
value, not time.

Remember, there is no bar exam, no medical license, no pilot's license
(and medical test which I failed), etc. for programming and to quote a
popular book -- the world is flat.

Ok, I'll stop acting like my father and yoda and will now put on my body
armor...

Cliff

Excellent comments - however I'd just like to add that when you choose
an area for specialization, you do not become dependent upon vertical
technologies. In the webspace at least, trends come and go at a
frightening pace, so being an AJAX specialist may net you lots of
bootie right now and then land you on the bench, permanently, when the
next big thing comes along.

And the markup is not really semanticly sound.  I hate mixing markup 
with code, but you may want to consider:

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($category)) {
     echo '<tr><td><label for="'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number'])
         . '">'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_desc'])
         . '</label>'
         . '</td><td><input type="text" name="expense_cat'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number'])
         . '" id="'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number'])
         . '" value="" /></td></tr>' . "\n";
}


Or even using a definition list, if you want to be super accessible:

echo '<dl>';

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($category)) {
     echo '<dt><label for="'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number'])
         . '">'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_desc'])
         . '</label>'
         . '</dt><dd><input type="text" name="expense_cat'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number'])
         . '" id="'
         . htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number'])
         . '" value="" /></dd>' . "\n";
}

echo '</dl>';

>If I may interject -- without anyone throwing spears my way.

No, your opinion has as much value as anyone else's. However, your 
opinion is based upon your experiences and those may be limited as 
compared to others.

That's nice in theory, but not that easy in practice. You might be a 
world authority on one specific topic, but if no one is interested, 
then you're out of luck (been there, done that -- and that's another 
topic).

But opportunity (excluding health) is what is most important. Most of 
us (my past self included) often take opportunity for granted -- we 
think it will always be around, but that's not true. And one day you 
may find yourself without opportunity and then will be willing to 
settle for just about anything, while holding your breath waiting for 
a better opportunity. However, holding your breath has it's limits.

So, putting on my "father-yoda" suit, I say take every opportunity 
afforded you because this too will pass.

Not only that, but I've seen numerous times on guru.com where 
potential employers have a long list of requirements, but won't pay 
over $10 per hour.

Over the last 60+ guru.com prospects I've submitted (where I took the 
time and personally addressed the clients needs in the proposal) I've 
had three reply: One, I spent another couple of hours of my time 
trying to convince him that the problem actually had a solution; One, 
I sent several emails asking about funding his grandiose idea, but no 
support of funding was forthcoming; And the last, I had an interview 
for $50 per hour where, after driving an hour (which is not easy for 
me), no one even attended the interview -- and this was not a small 
company.

Outside of guru.com, which has only cost me money, I don't even want 
to address the problems I've encountered in trying to find work. In 
short, I've had terrible luck in finding work.

However, programming is what I like, and like the starving artist, 
I'll continue practicing my craft and perhaps after I'm dead, it will 
be worth something. :-)

I picked an area of specialization and found myself on the bench -- 
so, I can speak to the truth of that observation.

Mitch has some great thoughts. So think UI, security, DB, etc.
functionality, not technology. I think guru.com and elance are
ridiculous ways to generate business. Let's think about this --
auctioning off your services... I just hired a writer for $8/hour.
Seriously...

To draw a parallel to the semiconductor space, RF design specialists are
in really, really hot demand. RF will never, ever go away. It is not a
technology, it is a market arena. But that poor semiconductor guy that
focused on emitter coupled logic isn't looking too happy -- that is
unless he shifted with the market and realized his expertise wasn't
actually ECL -- it was high speed design and hey guess what, that's kind
of like RF isn't it or that 3GHz processor that is fabricated in CMOS
but has the same exact design challenges as that 20 year old ECL
process.

I'm trying to find a way to, from PHP, see the entire string that is 
being sent by the client to the server, especially the header.  There 
are many ways to see things IN the header, but I am looking for a way to 
see the WHOLE string.  Any ideas?

I have to pipe in here and say something about guru.com...  maybe you guys
are not using the system properly, i have been a member for 4 months and
brought in a lot of cash, i have jumped to rank #12 so far and going to be
at #9 on the next update. I am not sure what you are doign wrong :)  Who
know's most of that is from one client also so it may be that i just got
lucky?

I love guru and will say your ranking and your professionalism will get you
far (as long as your knowledge and proficiency are there also)

Good thing you need TWO keys and authorization signed by the President 
before you can hit that big red button, monkey ;-)

As for "when the next big thing comes along" well now that should never 
happen, should it? The Next Big Thing is already out there somewhere 
picking up steam. Best not keep your head in the cubicle all day long.

It's all an eyesore to me. Not to start a religious debate, but this is
almost an argument for things like Smarty

{section loop=$rows name=i}
<tr>
    <td>{$rows[i].expenses_cat_number|escape}</td>
    <td>{$rows[i].expenses_cat_desc|escape}</td>
    <!--  etc -->
</tr>
{/section}

or perhaps an argument for dropping into good old HTML mode interpersed
with the "friendly" PHP syntax

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($category)) : ?>
<tr>
  <td><?= htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_number']?></td>
  <td><?= htmlspecialchars($row['expenses_cat_desc']?></td>
  <!--  etc -->
</tr>
<?php endwhile; ?>

On that note -- and this isn't directed ay anybody.
 
To me guru or elance is a launching point. When I went through several
recent searches, I was generally shocked at the low quality of many
service provider web sites. Shabby, broken links, unimpressive
portfolios, etc. This is your Billboard!!! I know some say, "I'm too
busy" or "I have too much work." But if you don't -- show off.
 
When I see bad web sites, I think that either you don't know what you
are doing or you don't care.
 
Show me a great web site, a thoughtful blog, a wicked cool -- as we say
in Boston -- feature, and I think, "wow, this person is good, this
person is passionate about what he/she does.

I know of a couple [built in] ways to see the headers, not sure about the whole request.

one if you are using PHP 5:

<?php
headers_list();
?>

and one if you are using PHP >= 4.3.0 :

<?php
$headers = apache_request_headers();

foreach ($headers as $header => $value) {
   echo "$header: $value <br />\n";
}
?>

Oh, no offense taken -- but in truth, I'm not the sharpest crayon in

I know what you mean. But, a web site may not be a good indicator of 
the persons abilities.

For example, besides this list (and others) I also attend the 
css-discuss list, where they have css experts who have web sites that 
don't validate while they preach compliance.

When confronted with "If you care about compliance issues, then why 
doesn't your site validate?" They respond with "Compliance is a goal 
and not a requirement" -- whatever that means. Like the Old Indian in 
Outlaw Josey Wales -- the politicians kept telling him "We admire 
your persistence in your commitment to persevere" -- I don't 
understand what the hell they're telling me.

In any event, I think that web sites are not a good tool for 
measuring ability -- even with those proficient in css. It probably 
best to look at their work product.

As for me, my site is not great, but it's not bad, it validates, 
meets disability issues, and has a good ranking -- so, I think it 
works in the ways I think are important. But as far as sending any 
business my way as as result of "wow, this person is good", nah -- 
that hasn't happened.

That is funny. Never is this theory tested more than in marketing. Your 
logic says a good marketer must have an amazingly well marketed 
business. Hah.

The best marketers I know do no marketing at all for their own 
businesses. The best SEOs I know have simple, one age websites, and even 
then only because they needed somewhere to point the people they 
*didn't* want to talk to.

I work in competitive tactics. I deploy fast and innovate on the fly. 
Almost everything is opportunity driven, and backed by a strong faith in 
fundamentals. That flies in the face of modern "expectations". I *could* 
show you my tricks and tactics and methods by using them on my own 
website, but why would I? In fact, it is conceivable that I would use 
the wrong methods and tactics on my public website, just to distract the 
competition from my real work.

Ditto for CSS pros who achieve goals with CSS. Why give it away by 
labeling it as "your best work" and putting it up at a known address for 
anyone to inspect, copy, critique?

I know.... not a simple topic. Chicken and egg, etc. But it has always 
been true that you should not judge a book by it's cover in most cases.

If YOU are (or can be) the client, I would recommend the Tamper plugin

No, if you will note, I said the opposite. A web site 
(self-marketing) may NOT be a good indicator of the persons abilities.

>The best marketers I know do no marketing at all for their own

What I know of SEO is more than what can be shown by any single web 
site -- the bottom line is the number of productive hits that count 
and that can be only measured by the recipient.

>I work in competitive tactics. I deploy fast and innovate on the fly.

Don't.

>In fact, it is conceivable that I would use

In my mind, that's thinking too much. That's like walking into a 
party thinking everyone notices you, when in fact no one cares -- 
they're too involved with other things to notice.

>Ditto for CSS pros who achieve goals with CSS. Why give it away by

Then why do css pro's (or anyone for that matter) write books or 
participate in discussion groups? Remember, they have to put out 
their best work, or no one will buy it. Plus, and more importantly, 
there is a professional clique from peers that's expected and has 
consequences if you don't produce.

Reputation is paramount and becoming increasingly more so.

>I know.... not a simple topic. Chicken and egg, etc. But it has always
>been true that you should not judge a book by it's cover in most cases.

I'll agree with you there. I would much rather be underestimated, and 
surprise people, than be overestimated and make a fool of myself -- 
I've done enough of that already.

Best,

I second that. TamperData is a great tool:
    http://tamperdata.mozdev.org/

Also you may try reading standard input:
    $raw_request_data = file_get_contents('php://input');
if you wish to do it server side.

HTH,

Just wanted to chime in here for a second. While I understand what
you're saying, I don't totally agree with your assumptions that a bad
website means someone either doesn't know what they are doing or that
they don't care.

I'm a PHP developer. Most of what I do is actual coding with very
little website design. I *can* design a website but it's not going to
be nearly as good looking as someone who does design day in and day
out. Ask me to code PHP and I can do nearly anything you like; ask me
to design you a great site and it will be a little harder for me
because I am not a designer. Does that mean I don't know what I'm
doing in my area of expertise? Absolutely not.

I think when you're considering someone for a job you need to take
into account what their skills and experience are. Being a strong PHP
developer doesn't automatically mean you're a strong website designer.
 And not being a strong website designer doesn't mean you're not an
incredible PHP developer. You just can't judge one set of skills by
another. It'd be like saying someone is a poor driver so they must be
a poor mechanic. The two aren't mutually inclusive.

Message-ID: <444136E2.4050201@neuropunks.org>

Hello all,
does anyone know of any opensource/free web app security scanner?
Basically, I just want something (else besides me) to go through all the
GET's and POST's on my PHP site and see if XSS/sql injection/etc is
possible.
I certainly did an audit of my own code, but another pair of eyes,
especially automated, would never hurt.
Something down the lines of Nessuss only for web apps basically.
I've seen this: www.acunetix.com, and signed up for a trial audit, but
am wondering if there is something I can actually download.
I havent seen anything on freshmeat or even google, most things are
either tutorials or non-free.

thanks!

But you enjoy the cloak-and-daggerness of it, and you obviously have
enough work to keep you busy and networked into new clients. If you
were looking for growth, you would deploy world-class techniques and
sit at the top of the results. The volume of new business could allow
you to hire a big chunk of the competition.

You're trolling now, because anybody who writes CSS for a living knows
that their work is on display for anyone to see. My god, how fortunate
you will be if someone actually takes the time to inspect, copy, and
critique.

The only reason to hide a good idea is because you are afraid you'll
never have a better one. Good luck selling yourself if you're never
going to have any more good ideas.

Although not totally what you are looking for as it wont test custom
applications, Nikto <http://www.cirt.net/code/nikto.shtml> has a decent
arsenal of _generic_ test.  And knowing that at least someone on the
Internet may run it against your site, it might as well be you. ;-)

Foundstone has an app called WSDigger ... and a slew of others tools  
you might want to check out ...

http://www.foundstone.com/resources/s3i_tools.htm

Best bet might be to drop by your local Barnes and Noble and check  
out the resources listed on the backs of the "l33t" books ... or keep  
tabs on a site like packetstormsecurity.org.

Along the same Firefox discussion, this is a pretty sweet plugin/ 
extension Ive been playing around w/ past few days ...

https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1843

-snip-
FireBug lets you explore the far corners of the DOM by keyboard or  
mouse. All of the tools you need to poke, prod, and monitor your  
JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Ajax are brought together into one seamless  
experience, including an error console, command line, and a variety  
of fun inspectors.
-snip-

Try including prototype/scriptaculous on any project and away you go ...

If I wanted to spend my hours managing a large business with employees 
and clients maybe, but I prefer to spend my hours optimizing and 
strategizing. Growth for me is larger, more complex and long term 
projects, not volumes if optimize-these-title-tags work where I would 
have to hire monkeys and  cut contracts with banana farmers. The problem 
with my line of work is that it is easier to make $N using the tools for 
myself in the market than to make the same $N deploying the tools for 
someone else. Customers are not often interested in paying to learn why 
they should do what I suggest, and I literally have to dig into a field 
in order to be successful (so it has to be interesting to me either 
way). What sells SEO is competition - when a site owner loses to rank 
the owner seeks out an SEO. What they will find in the SEO serps  is 
someone to take their money. If you even try to rank in the SEO world 
you will have to outrank big money fast-talking MMF outfits and that's 
not affordable.

Me? Troll? No way!  ;-)     Eric Meyer does not have an excellent 
website IMHO, yet he's a CSS guru. And if I challenged you to find a URL 
that showcased his best work, could you? I have often wished I knew when 
my CSS guru launched a new site... I'd be all over it as I would not 
have to pay him so much to repeat the best of it for me. And he knows 
that, and keeps his client list under wraps.

Not true at all in an opportunity-driven market. Good ideas are cheap, 
and execution is everything. I can guarantee you that if I post a page 
of my best SEO work with my name on it, it will be duplicated many times 
in the same markets within days. Partly because my work is focused on 
opportunity (if I did it there must be opportunity) but also because of 
a blind faith that I would not have executed if it were not worthwhile - 
a blindness fueled by the low cost of copying.  Misdirection raises the 
costs of copying.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] phpmailer + general PHP/email strategies?
Message-ID: <dc1507df0604171156t24d21202yc2563c2cba9f0d93@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,
I'm working with phpmailer to send email announcements. It's working, but
I'm concerned that maybe it's not working as efficiently as it could be.
I've sent it to a relatively small group of people (about 35) and I don't
see the group getting beyond 100 email addresses for this application.
However, looping through the addresses tends to go slowly -- fine for if I'm
using it myself, but possibly too long to expect other users to wait.

Because each email has information specific to that user, I'm sending
individual emails instead of just adding all the addresses to a Bcc in one
message. So the code is something like this:
---------
$mail = new PHPMailer();
foreach ($recipients as $r){
  bodymsg = "Hi $name";
  $mail->Body = $bodymsg;
  $mail->AddAddress($r);
   if(!$mail->Send()){
      //do something
   } else {
     //etc
  }
  $mail->ClearAddresses(); //clear for next loop
}
---------
Is this a reasonable way to do it? Is there a more efficient way of handling
the code? Or maybe phpmailer is not the right tool.

My other thought is that maybe the actual mailing should happen behind the
scenes, using cron (all the user data is in MySQL) ...


Thanks in advance,
Robyn

It depends if you're right or left handed.

You may try your luck with Adobe Illustrator, it may (or not...) open the
doc.pdf and then you can edit it.

I think you want http://fpdi.setasign.de/index.php?p=home

I have a project in which I am going to need to open a PDF template and
fill in some data. Just to prove I could do it I created a document in
OpenOffice Writer with an empty rectangle drawn in a more or less
arbitrary position on the page, then saved it as a PDF called
test_pdf.pdf, then tried to use this class to open it, squirt some fresh
red ink right into the little box and save the new PDF to disk. It works.


<?php

define('FPDF_FONTPATH','../font/');
require('./fpdi.php');

$pdf= new fpdi();
$pdf->setTextColor(255,0,0);
$pagecount = $pdf->setSourceFile("./test_pdf.pdf");
$tplidx = $pdf->ImportPage(1);
$pdf->addPage();
$pdf->useTemplate($tplidx);
$pdf->SetXY(66,52);
$pdf->SetFont('helvetica','B',10);
$pdf->Cell(150,20,'new text written '.date('r'));
$pdf->Ln(5);
$pdf->SetX(66);
$pdf->Cell(150,20,'more text written soon thereafter');
$pdf->Output('./output.pdf','F');
$pdf->closeParsers();
echo "ok";

?>

Well, heres a short followup on this.
I used the acunetix free web based scanner, and it seems to be pretty thourough.
The free report of course has no details in it, only number of potentials problems.
However, looking at the webserver logs, you can see what they were checking for, and it looks serious.
They try 13 different XSS attacks, 3 sql injections, cookie rewriter, all kinds of dir traversal, and 
trace/track/connect http request issues.
I still dont think im going to dish out 3 something K for the full version, but at least from their brief report you can check the logs for their requests, and see your server's response, and try it yourself.
Pretty educational overall actually.

Thanks Max. Did you go for the "free website audit" because I dl'ed the 
free scanner and it says it only runs against their test sites, not your 
own sites. Thanks.

Yup, it was this http://www.acunetix.com/vulnerability-scanner/audit.aspx
They do verify if your email address matches the site though.
In my case, the IP block the dev site was on is owned by our company, so I emailed them from my work email, and they queued it up. The email about verification did come from a real human too.
If you\'d like, I can email you off list the logfiles from the webserver so you can see the queries they make.

I have 1 small comment on this issue. Instead of using any other software  
to scan all these, can't we scan all our get and post variable for  
validity of data using regular expressions?

For example, we can 3 numeric variables that we receive via GET method.  
Before using them for further operations in our script, we can design a  
function that can check data associated with those 3 variables. If data of  
any of that variable seems invalid you can through 400 error (Bad request).

I assume we can control 90% of our data by scanning them ourselves since  
we most of time know what data is going to arrive with those variables.  
Similarly we can do for POST variables as well.

<?php

include_once 'some_function.inc'

scanGetVars($_GET);

...
...
rest of code.

Well, i personally use switch() to filter main input (like index.php?section=about)
and then everything thats GET or POST goes into addslashes and either has html/script things stripped, or converted to htmlentities.
if you look at preg_replace on php.net manual, you'll find some examples on how to strip html/script tags easily.
This audit was still usefull in my opinion. Its good to be able to see what someone who charges, and apparently successfully, for their scanning software would do to simulate real attacks.
Obviously, i can google for XSS, and I have, but another set of eyes is always great.

When you get right down to it, if you use the basic precautions laid out
in the relevant PHundamentals article
(http://www.nyphp.org/phundamentals/storingretrieving.php), you will not
need to 'strip' or 'filter' input to avoid breaking the application itself.

There are very few reasons to strip or filter data:

* if you need to echo user input to the browser as HTML, in which case
best practice would be to vet the tags using a whitelist approach

* if you are enforcing business rules (allowed values for a field, etc)

* if you are outputting data to other systems (eg sending email headers)

Provided you treat the data correctly, your program will see it as just
that, data, regardless of the content.  If certain input would break
your system, it is the system which should be changed, not the data.

Hey Dan I totally agree with you, but I also note that errors are made 
and systems are often coded by multiple people most of whom do not have 
the time to read through all of the code before adding or making changes 
to part of the code. So in the name of "robustness" isn't it still a god 
idea to sanitize everything? I think an optimization step might be to 
remove uneeded sanitization, but it seems to be a relatively low-cost 
safe practice to me.

Hello to all,

I am new and would like to introduce myself and say that I was happy to find a NY PHP group.  I'm from the Bronx.

I would like to ask if anyone knows what software http://www.blog-city.com/ is built on?  I want to create a site like this and have already installed software like wordpress and joomla.  I have tried customizing these to function so that users can create their own blogs. I installed the mamblog component. However, it doesn't work just like blog-city. If there is open source software that is designed to have a blog cms whose sole purpose is to host multiple user's blogs I would rather use that.

Thanks.

Kind regards,
David

Blog-city looks like it's built in Java, based on the error message
the "About Us" page generates.

But that's beside the point. Really, Joomla has no virtual hosting modules?

Whatever the system is, it's running on Jetty.

I haven't dug into that side of Joomla very deeply, but I know Drupal
can handle multiple blogs simultaneously...  and each user gets their
own feed, etc.

Hey everybody,

 

For about the last 7 hours I am trying to get a script to work and I have
absolutely no more ideas of why it isn't.

 

I run the script in a browser, and it has to run for some time, but after
about 20 minutes it suddenly . stops . it just pukes. No there is no error,
and yes the display_errors is on.  The script just stops as if it was stoped
by someone no eror, the erver has absolutely no load, so it's not the server
either.

I then put in the script once every 3-4 lines 

Echo __LINE__;  so I would actually know on what line it pukes. and it stops
randomly. Te funny thing is that last time I ran it, the last lines it
displayed were:

228, 234, 23  , so it just puked in THE MIDDLE of displaying 236!

 

Cound it be because of the browser???  Or the server would stop it??

I ran it in firefox and internet explorer.

 

Do any of you have any idea, because I would be imensly gratefull, at the
moment I am absolutely cluless!

 

Thanks a lot!!!!!

No solutions, but some thoughts...

Apache, IIS, other?

> after about 20 minutes it suddenly ? stops ? it just pukes.

If I read that sentence correct, that seems like quite a long time for a
(web) script to be running...?   Could you be hitting resource limits in
php.ini?  max_execution_time, max_input_time ?  Are you normally
outputting anything to the browser during this time?  Could the web
server _think_ it is a dead connection from no data being transfered for
such a long period and drop or kill it?

> No there is

To tell you the truth, sounds like a php segfault to me, any errors in
the web server logs? Can you turn web server log verbosity up?  Did you
compile PHP or a prepackaged one?  What extensions are loaded, can you
disable any of them?  Do you have any database connections open?  If so,
are the client versions compatible? (e.g. I have noticed some issues
with pgsql.so and Postgresql server 8.1 which may be related to the
version of pg libs it was compiled against)

what about adding some memory_get_usage () calls as well.

> Cound it be because of the browser???  Or the server would stop it??

There is also a setting in php.ini to ignore if the user clicks 'stop'
ignore_user_abort = On.

Perhaps no help at all, but thought I would share my first impressions.

Just to add as a side note, I try to keep my web facing scripts as
speedy as possible.  When there is a resource/time intense task (such as
gathering/sorting millions or rows from a db,) I almost always insert a
_request_ into a working queue, and return control to the browser as
quickly as possible.  I will then handle the request with a command line
script, and then notify the user via another method (email, web alert on
next page hit, etc.)  This method seems to blend better with the web
paradigm.

Once again I haven't helped you with your direct problem, but just
wanted to add some food for thought.

Ok, I will stop replying to my own post now. :-P

I thought segfault, too, but you usually don't get any output back.
Then again. if the script is running for 20 minutes, Apache may just
be flushing the output buffer out of boredom.

The script is used for spidering a site, which is quite big .. so the 20
minutes isn't that much. But each time the script finds a new link it
flushes it to the browser, so the connection shouldn't timeout or anything
...

Sounds like a segmentation fault. I saw this happen some time ago with a
similar script, where given the structure of the site one of the urls was
always different per page, creating an infinite descend.

Running on *nix, if you can run the script from the command line, "strace"
can help you debug and understand why the script is dying.

This doesn't fix your immediate problem, but if you are on *nix you
could run wget, lynx, or webBot to spider the site and then parse out
those results? 

I have had to do this in the past and used wget to recursively spider a
site and create html files locally. Once that is done I grep the results
and pipe them to sed and/or (g,n)awk to fine tune the desired results.

There are a ton of similar windows utilities out there as well if that
is your platform.

Hope this helps,

Jack

eh... it's mambo (basically) ;) I use it and enjoy using it. It's a  
bit overkill where wordpress is enough for simple blogs, but it's  
extensibility is great for sites with potential to get larger. I look  
forward to seeing what joomla will offer in the next major release.

Is there an easy way to get the properties of a Word doc in a php

tab.  I found some info on COM objects, but it's a little confusing.  My 
servers are IIS on Win2k.

Message-ID: <8d9a42800604211050j3942610bq5b6e00e51d0bd86@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

Is there a tool that can be used to scan php files in a dir to tell me if
there are any function / classes / variables / constants / etc. that are in
the code but never used?

This would come in handy for code where you were not the original developer
but wanted to clean things up without breaking functionality.

Is this something Zend Studio can do?  I have that but have not seen the
feature.

Thanks,

I believe you would need to use a COM object within PHP to actually launch
MS Word to read the files like you wish to.  I did an article on weberdev
about using Word and Mail Merge from within PHP.
http://www.weberdev.com/get_example-4232.html
It also explains that you need to set the COM permissions so that the IIS
user or current windows user has access to remotely open Word "hidden" in
the background.

I am on my way out, so no time to validate my claims/memory for
correctness, but take a look at xdebug and PHPUnit2 (or one of the
testing suites)

probably just a fleeting aggravation with the wysiwyg editor..as my 
machine crashed...probably due to an errant plug-in, or the 
spell-checker...who knows... or maybe I'm just tired of working thru the 
new rewrite system... or maybe it was the, oh nevermind.

Mismatch between htmlentities() charset parameter and Content-type charset?

Copy and paste from Word into web form?

Yes, that's what happens when you echoing something that's not within your
charset.

Printing high-bit chars can be weird, at best.  Our editor's format their
own HTML, but they also use stuff like Word and Quark, so I came up with a
blacklist mapping solution to keep any HTML we want but convert the high-bit
stuff like:

char(133) => '...' 
char(147) => '&quote;'
char(148) => '&quote;'
char(162) => '&cent;'
char(163) => '&pound;'
char(165) => '&yen;'

etc

Actually, I've been poking at pretty much the same thing today.  I'm
parsing an incoming rss feed and weird things appeared.  Turns out my
case is that it's a "smart quote" and causing all kinds of issues
because as soon as I do anything with it - other than an xml to xml
transform - it morphs into a nasty character like above...

Running a script for so long in a web browser is nuts.  Make it a shell 
script (possibly run via cron) that outputs HTML that you can look at once 
the process is done.

This is not an appropriate post for this list.  It doesn't relate to

Who knows what they were. Keep in mind that at 
each stage, each rendering agent (desktop 
application, browser, server, email client, etc.) 
displays the text as what it believes it is with 
the resources it has available (i.e., font, 
char-set, ASCII, Unicode code points) -- that's 
the reason for Unicode.

Just received a copy of "Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit"
from Syngress, and it looks like a great reference for everyone that
builds websites. A big, thick beastie, there seems to be a load of
reference on many different toolkits and plenty of language-based
discussion (c, perl, php, etc).

Might want to start there, if you want something with some heft to
keep you busy ;-)

IMHO the tools like nmap, nessus and ettercap are a great start, but
just that - a start. Getting an understanding of how these tools work,
and why they do what they do, is the real value. With that knowlege
you are then empowered to take a proactive approach.

Actually, what was called Mambo is now Joomla, and what is now called
Mambo is something completely different. I'd tell you more, but I'm
supposed to advise everyone to wait for the movie.

Then download the 1.5 nightly, found from our developer portal:

    http://dev.joomla.org

Also, you can peruse the newfangled API here:

    http://api.joomla.org

The coolest thing (IMHO) about what we have done with the 1.5 release
is the JApplication class, where you can make a standalone PHP script
that uses the same session management, database access, and so on
without having to make a proper component and serve it from a Joomla
website. And the XML-RPC server and client are now default, and there
is already a Java-based flat client for content managers in a working
state.

Oh, you gotta check out the nightly, we just did some freaky work on
the front end editor too...

In a way, you could say we wrote the Joomla CMS with the Joomla
framework. Maybe it's time for another presentation? Is there any
interest in this?

Hey again,

I ran it with strace , and yes, it's a segmentation fault ... here are the
last few lines from the output txt file:

send(8, "\35\300\1\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\3www\ttalkshack\3com\0\0"..., 35, 0) =
35
poll([{fd=8, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN}], 1, 5000) = 1
ioctl(8, FIONREAD, [145])               = 0
recvfrom(8, "\35\300\205\200\0\1\0\2\0\2\0\2\3www\ttalkshack\3com\0"...,
1024, 0, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(53),
sin_addr=inet_addr("69.93.35.154")}, [16]) = 145
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) @ 0 (0) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV (core dumped) +++

Now .. my problem would be.. does anyone have ay idea how to interpret
strace output???  

Thx...

Sounds like a segmentation fault. I saw this happen some time ago with a
similar script, where given the structure of the site one of the urls was
always different per page, creating an infinite descend.

Running on *nix, if you can run the script from the command line, "strace"
can help you debug and understand why the script is dying.

Back in my Zope/Plone days *gasp* there was always the PyUNO driver
from OpenOffice.org to convert, manipulate, or pretty much whatever
you wanted. To this day, I have not heard of anything that was similar
in the PHP world.

Is that still the case? Do I still have to fire off a python script to
manipulate office binary files? Looking around PEAR and the
documentation, I have no idea what extensions are available to work
with these binary formats.

PHP which probably has 10X-50X  the number of developers, yet nothing

Numbering them from the top down.

#1 is a very useful tool, but not when it's empty
#2 is essential
#3 is very, very useful
#4 I never use
#5 I never use
#6 I never use
#7 I never use
#8 is a legal technicality I rarely use, but has a place and is used by 
some scanners.

<opinion off-topic>
Meta tags used to be important, but much less so these days and even 
less so tomorrow. They were a way to provide a short cut to what the 
site was about, but now for several reasons, they aren't very 
important any longer.

In the above article "The Semantic Web" by Tim Berners-Lee he essentially
presents that meta data (data about data) will be a vital component in the
intricately interconnected Internet that will lift Web 2.0 into a new realm.


So just to keep in spirit with his forward looking premise, I use all the
META tags that I can get my hands on. I try not to overload the tags, but I
use them nonetheless.

Whatever, take a read of the article as it provides some intriguing
perspectives on why we are programming what we program.

Meta tags used to be important, but much less so these days and even 
less so tomorrow. They were a way to provide a short cut to what the 
site was about, but now for several reasons, they aren't very 
important any longer.

PHP client support is definitely on the roadmap of client library
languages that will be available.   I can't give you a specific
availability date right now, but can say that there is work in
progress and it will be supported.

Yes, thanks I saw that post.

wondering why some hardcore php folks we not at the head of the pack!

I think this thread illustrates one of the challenges faced by the 
security community - inconsistent vocabulary. I've seen strip, filter, 
and sanitize used to describe various types of activity, including escaping.

All input should be filtered, without exception. Inspection is better 
than stripping, and escaping is an entirely different topic (of equal or 
greater importance).

For the curious ...

Don't other APIs already work the same? Couldn't you just reuse  
something else?

Message-ID: <30067-11903@sneakemail.com>

Just to clarify, and the reason I started my reply with "everyone has an 
opinion" :  my advice is based on current performance-based research. 
Not theory, not future projections, not relative to yesterday,  but what 
works today (with "works" defined as a performance metric - 
customer-facing user interface issues, search marketing/SEO, and the 
like). If I build a site today... this is what I would do.

I don't view this as OT but respect the list's opinion on that. It is 
not OT for me because I am forever asking PHP coders to *start* with an 
assumption that meta data is dynamic (not static), that link attributes 
are dynamic (not static with default values) etc etc etc. IMHO PHP is 
great for the power it provides, and not so great for the power it hands 
over to the PHP coder (vs the page designer or website designer or 
business strategist).

FWIW: I gave a presentation this weekend on PHP Application Security.
Although bullets and slides can be misleading without the commentary, I
 figured I would share them with the group.  You will no doubt see an
uncanny influence from some of the greats on this list.  I did try to
make my presentation my own, but there is no denying "Filter Input,
Escape Output" is classic.  (I even presented in uniform

Of course constructive criticism is welcome as I always strive to improve.

Does anyone have a recommendation (notes of caution, other helpful tips,

Have you used any GPL (preferably PHP/MySQL) search engine product(s) that
spider  
HTML, text files and can [optionally] do PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint
files.

mann i sooo miss EWS. (for those who dont recall - it was Excite for Web 
Servers)

and there are a few on here that are ok
http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Scripts/Searching/Searching_Your_Web_Site/
but i can't personally attest to the usability for these. since i 
haven't used one for a few years now - the older ones used to work 
really nicely, but the only thing is how you're web pages are SEO'd or 
if they are just flat text.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Arrays and string concat in classes
Message-ID: <444CFC37.1070706@gmx.net>

<lurk mode off>
Hi folks,

Today I found an interesting/anoying thing regarding classes in PHP4.
What I tried was this:

class blabla
{
	var $bla = array(
				'test' => MY_CONSTANT.'some text'
			);
}

and PHP threw an error ("syntax error, unexpected '.', expecting ')'"). 
It seems that string concatenation is not allowed.

Is this a bug or a feature? Why should this not be allowed?

Thanks and also many thanks for all the other interessting things I can 
read on that mailing list.

Kind regards from Munich, Germany

Michael

Michael,

This is because you cannot have evaluated code in the class definition.

If you were to use the construct:

class blabla
{
  var $bla;

  function blabla()
  {
    $this->bla = array(
      'test' => MY_CONSTANT.'some text'
    );
  }
}

That would work because the concatenation is evaluated when the object
is instantiated.

No offense, but "meta-tags" are not even mentioned in the above 
article and the subject of the post was "meta-tags".

The article deals with the larger use and application of data (i.e., 
data-mining, agents, XML, AI) rather than trying to cram everything 
"important" into a limited and outdated meta-tag methodology.

Sure, if you want to keep with current misconceptions, then put in 
meta-tags in your web pages -- after all, it certainly won't hurt. 
However, their contribution is questionable; what tag to use ranges 
from "useless" to "can't hurt"; their misuse is far too common; and 
their future is certainly limited. In short, they are problematic in 
their delivery of useful and accurate information.

If one wanted to study the difference between what the web author 
thought of his publication and what it actually was, then meta-tags 
may have some value. But outside of that, meta-tags usefulness as a 
real description as to what the content of a web page is falls 
woefully short.  And because of this shortcoming, unless something 
changes, their future is limited as an accurate source of information.

Meta-tags are/were meant for search engines. But not all search 
engines use them the same way and Google even reports that they don't 
use them at all (but, I suspect they do).

But as to the question of using "meta-tags" -- use them, or don't. 
But, it's the content of your site that makes the real difference.

So why haven't _you_ done it?

I looked at their API. I thought, "Yep, I can develop against that."
And then I went back to work. It's no big deal... is it?

Just to add some fuel to this fire:

<META> tags are toooo 90s, but if the client likes to see them in the
code they aren't going to hurt anything (subject to John Andrew's
observations, of course). They will only ever be used by internal
search engines, because no one else is gonna be looking for them.

The most robust and extensible way to do the same thing is to use
embedded RDF with Dublin Core extensions, which is what Sir TBL was
pimping in that 2001 article that Peter sent. At least if external
search engines are looking for Creative Commons or Friend-of-a-Friend
metadata, they will find and parse your RDF.

Like many great solutions, RDF will probably never catch on because
people just can't bear to think in tuples. Hence the Web 2.0 style,
which is preferred by the in-crowd right now:

<link rel="robots" href="/robots.txt" />
<link rel="category" href="/path/to/category.html" />
<link rel="author" href="/path/to/author.html" />
... etc.

Until one or more of the major search engines puts up a sign saying
"Semantic Web Now Open" with a list of names/relations to use on your
content, it's all a bit of a crapshoot. If you have some internal
reason to put metadata on your pages, then decide on a namespace and
go for it. Otherwise, I'm not sure why you'd bother.

ahhh, well I would love to do it, except I have a thesis due in 2
weeks, 18 graduate credits, and a full time coding gig.

so I'm diving into the python api.  figure that might be fun!

That's the point exactly... as php coder/developer, you're not sure why 
anyone would bother. But is that your call?

Meta data is "about" the content, and as such it may have a value of 
"empty" but it has to be able to accept a value if one is desired.If one 
is desired, it is likely to be contextual... so the coder needs to be 
prepared for that. Sure, it's not worth it... until one day someone 
needs it and it's a tear-out job just to make it possible.

<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nocache, follow"> is an important 
meta tag today for all the major search engines. It is 
context-dependent, where in this particular case the context is the page 
as the page's purpose is defined within the site. It is also temporal... 
it may need to be something some times  and different other times.  It 
may also be visitor-dependent, as itis in the case of IP-based content 
delivery. So what is the hook for this dynamic meta data? The coder 
usually won't know... the site achitect would, as would the strategist 
working at the SEO level.

In most cases I see (every case aside from my own sites?) there is no 
hook at all.

Now after we talk about the dynamic nature of meta tags, we can talk 
about the dynamic nature of anchor text. and then CSS positioning 
outside of content. And styles. And on and on.

I see so much talk about "dynamic sites" and yet so little recognition 
of dynamic "sites".... just dynamic pages. I could write a book about 
this... oh, wait a sec....

No offense meant, but this meta-tag is just plain dumb.

When a robot visits your page, they are there to do one job and 
that's to index your site -- why tell a robot to do something that 
they are there to do anyway?

If you want to forbid robots from indexing portions of your site, 
then use directives in robot.txt. But, if you think that the above 
meta-tag is an important meta-tag and one that is considered 
important by ALL the major search engines, then think again, it's not.

If you want to use meaningful meta-tags, then consider the following:

  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" >

That with most browsers, places a nice icon in the viewer's url.

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;> charset=utf-8">

This set's your char-set for your site -- nice to have for unicode characters.

  <meta name="Content-Language" content="EN">

This is nice to have for setting the language and (to bring this 
on-topic) can be used by php/ajax for changing language settings on 
the fly.

<meta name="Keywords" content="fly fishing, flies, fly tying 
materials, fly fishing tackle, fly accessories, saltwater, 
freshwater, salmon, trout">

  <meta name="description" content="fly fishing flies for saltwater & 
freshwater flyfishing, tying materials, and other resources.">

Keywords and description tags can be useful for some search engines, 
but not ALL search engines consider them. In addition, meta-tags can 
hurt if you don't know how to use them -- like using the same keyword 
more than three times in a tag (i.e., such as "fly" in the above 
meta-tag). Some SE's consider that spamming and will treat your site 
accordingly.

Additionally, there are many different methods of using php, 
php/ajax, css, javascript to present selected text to SE's while 
presenting something different to the viewer.

For example, expert SEO guru's say that keywords count more when 
placed in paragraphs toward the beginning of your text content. 
However, by using css, you can place paragraphs anywhere you want in 
the html (for a SE perspective) and have those paragraphs appear in a 
different positions to the viewer. A trick that SE's won't detect and 
even with a personal review, there's nothing wrong with using css to 
rearrange things -- css' purpose is to separate style from content, 
right?

You can drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what to do with 
meta-tags -- testing, changing, testing, but in the end there's no 
guaranteed formula that will work, regardless of what the SEO guru's 
(with a vested interest) will say.

The truth is, that meta-tags are not actually needed. As a test, not 
that one test is conclusive, I created a site that has a current 
PageRank of 5 without ANY meta-tags whatsoever and without even 
submitting the site to a single search engine -- explain that.

The explanation is that robots index sites, on their own time table, 
and make their own assessments regardless of meta-tags. SE's method 
of evaluating sites is a dynamic process continuously in a state of 
flux and is certainly not constrained, limited, or influenced greatly 
by the use of meta-tags. We've gone far past that.

Congrats.  As the author of many, many pages with #1 ranks, it seems to 
me, the meta tags are part of the strategy.  In addition, I know John and 
that his advice works.  So, +1 for meta tags.

I would not disagree... much of what goes on these days seems dumb to me 
as well.

I'll try, but there are others on this list that are better versed in PR 
than I am.

Page Rank is a reflection of backlink support. Get a few links from pr6 
pages that don't link to to many others, and you'll earn yourself a PR5. 
It has nothing to do with meta tags or even page content for that 
matter. Unfortunately, PageRank has little to do with your appearance in 
the results sets as well. It does seem to get spidered alot more, 
though, and it gives links on your pages more "authority". Hopefully, 
you know what to do with that authority (these days it seems the best 
use of a high PR is to sell links to less-knowledgable people who think 
it is important).

>The explanation is that robots index sites, on their own time table, and make their own assessments regardless of meta-tags. SE's method of evaluating sites is a dynamic process continuously in a state of flux and is certainly not constrained, limited, or influenced greatly by the use of meta-tags. We've gone far past that.

Here's an example of creative use of the robots tag. Suppose you have a 
shopping cart full of product info pages, product purchase pages, and 
follow up "you bought this you might also like that" pages. You don't 
want anything cached, because you don't believe Google has a right to 
show your content without your knowing about it/countng it/putting ads 
onto it/whatever. You don't want the actual cart pages (product 
purchase) to be indexed, because they are just lists of somebody's 
order. You want the follow-on pages of suggestions to be indexed because 
of their excellent cross-referenced linking (a.k.a. effective use of 
PR). So you set the product pages to "index, follow, nocache" and the 
cart pages to "noindex, follow, nocache" and the follow-on pages to 
"index, follow, nocache" and the spider does as you request. Most of you 
out there know how to do that dynamically via PHP..it's just writing out 
the meta info on page load.

What would the robots.txt alternative approach be?

-=john:

My "question" was rhetorical -- I believe I know what PageRank 
represents (link popularity). However admittedly, I do not know how 
the algorithm works. I've read and tried to understand the 
explanations provided by Larry Page et al, I get the general idea, 
but the details are beyond me.

Okay, PageRank and meta-tags have nothing to do with each other 
directly, but both are used in some fashion to determine SE placement 
of a site, correct? So, in that manner, they are related. The 
importance of that relationship is unknown by me -- your mileage may 
vary.

As for meta-tags, I'm not disputing that the keywords and description 
are not used, but I am suggesting that their importance is lessening. 
I am also suggesting that several of the meta-tag types are simply 
not of any value.

However, you have given me cause for me to re-think my stand 
regarding the robot tag. As for my stand on meta-tags, I seldom think 
of anything these days as being sound enough foundation to stand upon.

In any event, I shall comment on the remaining portion of your post 
as soon as I can digest and investigate it. :-)

Thanks for the exchange.

Funny how something as trivial as meta tags leads to insightful 
discussions, but it is always true. I see post after post on SEO forums 
about how meta tags are dead, yet barely a decent discussion of *why* or 
*how* they might be useful. Here, we really didn't even get into most of 
the meta tags... there was so much to talk about around the meta tag 
issue an done example of meta robots.

Now how about the isue as many people will have interpreted it? Do the 
meta-keywords and meta-description tags have any value today?

Hop on over to search.msn.com and run a query. Take "php training" (no 
quotes) for example. Now look at the top 5 results. View source for 
each. What do you see? You see title text and meta-desc and meta-kw 
aligning with SERP rank, except in the most obvious cases of authority 
(php.net). Now try it again with something less competitive... what do 
you see?

90% of SEO is as hard as washing your car. Everybody can do it, and if 
they put a little work into it they can do a great job. But do they?

From my understanding, meta description is the

search engines.

Message-ID: <444E73CE.4000801@aarond.com>

I apologize if this has been hashed over before, but I wanted to get the 
nyphp feel for any proven ways to integrate java & php code.

The setup I'm going for is to have Java handle user authorization 
(already setup) and allow php to tell if a user has permission to view 
certain data by asking a java class. The options I've seen are setting 
up a php/java bridge on a php server 
(http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/) or to integrate php into a 
Java servlet environment. (I hope I'm wording this correctly. I'm just 
the php side working with the java developers)

thoughts or links?

thanks,
Aaron D.

Yola,

Does setting in httpd.conf for mod_php

php_admin_flag display_errors on

count as being set at runtime? In php.ini, display_errors is off. But
that cannot be changed. So I cannot display fatal errors. Is the only
way to display fatal errors to change php.ini?

you can use ini_set() in your scripts:

I don't think ini_set display_errors catches fatals. But I just solved
my problem. Thanks anyway!

I am not soliciting business and am not available for new contextual 
advertising clients, but I will say that those who think they can do it 
themselves competitively are providing the profits for the rest of us. 
Of course there are exceptions.

I stand corrected -- well actually, I lean a bit to the right, but 
that's another topic.

I didn't understand the depth and scope of the robot-tag.

Thanks for straightening me out about that.

Thanks for the links I'll look over them but I don't have time to manage 
the marketing myself. When you guys create an e-com site for small 
business where do you send the client for marketing?

It really depends on the niche market they want to market to... you want 
a marketer who knows the niche but not a marketer who is a competitor in 
that niche (or whose biggest clients are competitors).

If you email me a few details I might be able to refer your client to 
someone appropriate.

Off the top of my head:

1) Exceptions (i know you already mentioned oop but i think  
exceptions are worth their own bullet)
2) file_put_contents (and all the other built in functions available  
only 5+  (userland alts are slower)
3) Speed (all of the big and little tweaks to memory handling pay  
off,  especially with OOP)
4) Reflection API  (as a lazy documenter,  i have a soft spot for the  
reflection api)
5) PDO  (parameter binding, easy,  parameter binding, easy)
6) Iterators (once again, oop but worth its own mention)
6) SPL (DirectoryIterator is so much more fun than opendir....)
7) Upgrading to php5 will give you practice for upgrading to php6.  :)

Probably taking some major php5 feature for granted but its been a  
while since I've had to work with php4 so my memory is a little dusty.

Good luck with the sell....

Thanks, so far. Okay, here is my improved list:
 
1) OOP for scaling up with diversified enterprise applications and
maintaining centralized control of core business logic. 
2) XML/RSS/Web Services integration more accurate, simpler and faster. Jump
starts integration potential with other sites and third-party services. 
3) File Upload is more secure and standardized. Firmer control at this vital
user interface. 
4) Date/Time handling is broadened in scope and features more date
formatting options to satisfy local and international needs. 
5) MySQL database interface is more coherent and more versatile: handles
connections and queries more efficiently. 
6) Read and display full directories with more ease, accuracy and speed.
This vital user experience is enhanced.
 
I need a few more features as they would be sold to an enterprise web site
management team, not as to be sold to programmers.
 
Any more PHP beats the street-wise ideas?

While we're on this topic, I was wondering if some people could enlighten me
on some good practices (if any at all really) for allowing users to upload
files via a php page.

Currently, I am using the ftp approach to upload certain files to my site,
but I'm not really sure if that's the safest / most effective way.  I had
been using move_uploaded_file() before, but that didn't seem to work for me
on some hosts (I'm on a shared host, and I probably will be for quite some
time).

Thanks.

PS, I don't mean to change the topic from Nick's but I've been wondering
about this for some time, and this seemed like a good place to ask the
question.

Peter,

Fact: PHP 4 is only receiving bug & security fixes.  No new features
will be added to PHP 4, nor will it receive maintenance.

Speculation, as I don't believe its been discussed in a public forum by
those who make such decisions: I expect PHP 4 to be sunsetted
eventually, but the userbase is very large so it is hard to guess how
long that might be.  For reference, PHP 3 was sunsetted about 5 months
after PHP 4 was released.  We've now seen PHP 4 be supported much longer
than that, but who knows how much longer.

If others knows more about this subject, please speak up.

Based on my experience, PHP 4 will be sunsetted right around the time
none of the core developers are still using it.

Any good framework to develop in is going to require the advanced features
of php5, there is just no way php4 can do this well.  Probably a good
argument for an enterprise web site management team.

Okay, here's more sell based on the input and comments:
 
7) Freely-available, superior open source PHP business-solutions projects in
their next wave will not be backwards compatible to PHP4. 
8) PHP5 natively engenders coding innovation, improved security and more web
application strength.

Okay, here it is -- my last draft on "Selling the PHP 5 Upgrade":
 
1) XML/RSS/Web Services Integration 
Accurate, simpler and faster usage of these essential technologies. 
Jump starts integration potential with other sites and third-party services.

 
2) File Upload/Downloads Improved
This increasingly vital user interface is more securely implemented and 
the usage standardized for more exacting control. 
 
3) Date/Time Handling Improved
Date usage is broadened in scope and features more date formatting options 
to satisfy more local and international needs. 
 
4) Database Interface Improved 
More coherent and more versatile MySQL functions: opens/closes connections,
executes queries, 
and returns large result sets more efficiently. 
 
5) Directory Reading and Display Improved
Scan full directories of files with more ease, accuracy and speed. 
This resource intensive user experience is enhanced. 
 
6) OOP [Object Oriented Programming] Model 
Eases the maintenance of centralized core business logic and 
handles scaling up for large enterprise applications. 
 
7) PHP5 Eases Management Concerns
PHPP5 natively engenders more coding innovation. Management rests easier
knowing 
that web applications are being built from scratch with built-in improved
security and 
more application strength.
 
8) PHP5 Will Eclipse PHP4 in Best Code Projects 
Freely-available, open source PHP business-solutions projects 
in their next wave will not be backwards compatible to PHP4.

Jack,

ini_set('display_errors', 'on') will not work during a fatal parse
error. You can set this in .htaccess or httpd.conf using the
php_admin_flag or php_flag directives. At first I was having problems
with it.. I thought the .htaccess directive wasnt working. But then I
realized I was suppressing the messages with this typo:

error_reporting('E_STRICT');

oops.

Which ftp approach do you mean?

Some things you can do to safely handle uploaded files are:

1) use is_uploaded_file() to make sure you can trust the data in the
temporary file

2) make sure uploaded files are *never* saved with .php extensions (or
any other extension the webserver might execute as php). it's possible
to embed php code in files of any mimetype.

3) store uploads outside of the web root, so that an attacker can't
request an uploaded file directly. this helps mitigate the risk in #2.

This is the way I currently upload some images to my website now.  I really
have no idea how safe this is, so if its unsafe, please let me know.

// FTP configuration
    $ftp_server = 'myftpaddr';
    $ftp_user_name = 'myuser';
    $ftp_user_pass = 'mypass';

    // Connect
    $conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);

    // Get filename / extension
    $filename = explode('.', $_FILES['ap_filename']['name']);

    $ext = $filename[count($filename) - 1];

    // Make sure extension is jpg
    if(strtolower($ext) != 'jpg') {
        $failure = true;
        $message .= 'The file type must be jpeg.<br>';
    }

    // login with username and password
    $login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);

    // check connection
    if ((!$conn_id) || (!$login_result)) {
        $failure = true;
        $message .= 'Connection was not established.<br>';
    }

    // Change directory
    $directory = ftp_chdir($conn_id, 'path/to/dir');
    if(!$directory) {
        $failure = true;
        $message .= 'Could not change directories.<br>';
    }

    // Temporary name
    $source_file = $_FILES['ap_filename']['tmp_name'];

    // Real name
    $destination_file = $_FILES['ap_filename']['name'];

// some error handling

// upload the file
        $upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $destination_file, $source_file,
FTP_BINARY);

ftp_close($conn_id);

Ah, that ftp solution.

By using a localhost ftp connection, you can save the files as your
login user and avoid both world-writeable directories and undeleteable
(because owned by apache) files.

Those are big pros. There are also some big cons, depending on your situation.

First, we all know that ftp is an insecure protocol, right? This isn't
an issue if the ftp server is localhost, but if you are making
connections over a network you are potentially exposing your password
to anyone with access to the packets.

Second, and more importantly, you are potentially exposing your login
credentials to anyone else on the shared server with read access to
your script. This is the fundamental problem with shared hosting, and
it applies to database credentials as well. That seems like a bigger
risk (since all of your files are accessible) than just having a
world-writeable directory (where only uploaded files are accessible).

The convenience of having the uploaded files owned by you rather than
by the webserver may still outweigh the security issues, but you have
to make that call.

Not all shared servers are alike, of course. If you have any question
about whether other users on the box could read your scripts, ask your
hosting company.

Ah I see, thanks for the insight, greatly appreciated.  I'll contact my
hosting company to find out the details and make a decision based on the
facts.

I just got a steaming pile of PHP dropped in my lap which - as far as
I can tell - has no classes, 100+ functions, lots of globals, nothing
resembling security and/or input filtering, a rather large user base,
and a hitlist of new requirements/requests.  Help!

Alright, got that out of the way...

Now I'm trying to do some analysis to figure out which functions and
variables are/aren't being used, the general flow of the code, and
some basic metrics.  Something like PMD or Perl::Critic (I think)
would be the ideal, but now I'd just be happy with something beyond my
mediocre grepping skills.

I've dug around and found this -

May I suggest you get an Intern(s)  from a local college to give you a hand?

There are 1000's of students hitting the streets this Summer looking
for Internships. Yes, they do work for free (but hey, give them a few
$$$s), they need it for their resumes, and sometimes schools will give
them credit. And almost all colleges teach a PHP/scripting course.

Xdebug is great for tracing & profiling code.  Use it with kcachegrind
for nice visualization.  It won't give you the code analysis stuff that
Perl::Critic would, but its a start to give you a picture of whats going
on.

HTH,

The likelyhood they'll properly clean up the code and resolve security 
issues is VERY low.  Wouldn't be surprised if the reason the thing is a 
"steaming pile" is the people who wrote it in the first place were 
interns.

>From talking to some of the other people involved (non-technical), I
think this assessment was accurate.  It appears the bulk of the code
was written 2-3 years ago by a handful of people who were working on
their first non-academic project.  They didn't appear to be using
version control either, so there are huge sections commented out
instead of deleted... and the communication was poor, so there are
differing implementations for the same things.

The security aspect is one of the larger ones to me... as a test this
morning, I submitted some simple javascript alerts and sql-injection
and they made it through no problem.

Thanks for the tip on Zend Studio, I'll look into that first.

Google!  :-)

>From my experiences, students are VERY OFTEN much better at this
business then the teachers. Why? Because they have time on their

You could try RATS ...

When I saw Keith's post, I spit out my coffee. I wondered if he was 
hired to work on the code base of a little SEO project I'm doing... talk 
about steaming piles.

Unfortunately, Dan, this little beast in front of me was coded by people 
who are *gasp* on this list. As usual, I suspect it's management at 
fault. A terrible intern can be very helpful if properly managed.

Sir Nick:

You've got a lot of issues here.

You're letting users inject SQL statements.

Also, you're delimiting your table name, via "`".  You should never use 
names that require delimiting.  To make sure of that, never delimit names.

Plus, name your columns in the insert query.  Makes things clearer here 
and keeps you from having to rewrite your application if you add another 
column to the table at some point in the future.

So, turn that into:

  $filename_sql = mysql_real_escape_string($filename);
  $filetype_sql = mysql_real_escape_string($filetype);
  $query = "INSERT INTO media (fname, ftype) VALUES
           ('$filename_sql','$filetype_sql')";


> $result = mysql_query($query);
> $query = "SELECT * FROM `media` WHERE `filename` = '$filename'";

Simlilar things, escape the SQL and ditch the delimiters:

  $query = "SELECT * FROM media WHERE filename = '$filename_sql'";


> $result = mysql_query($query);
> $newname = mysql_result($result,0,"id");

Does the "media" table have a unique key to prevent file names from being 
reused?  Otherwise your logic will fail, since you'll end up getting the 
id for the earlier file.

I wouldn't call that variable $newname, since it's not a name, just an ID.

More importantly than all the above, it looks like that id column in the 
"media" table is an auto-increment.  Right?  If so, you don't even need 
that select query.  You can get the id by calling mysql_insert_id().

That should be capitalized and use a fully qualified URI, and you should 
use single quotes since it's not being evaluated (doesn't have variables 
in it):

  header('Location: http://host/dir/PAGE.PHP');


By the way, your coding standard is all over the place in terms of 
spacing, quoting and variable placement.  It helps in the long term to be 
consistent.

So, does PLACE exist?  Does the web server have permissions to that 
location?  Are you running in safe mode or have a restriction on open base 
dir?

I may actually have to eat my words - or at least nibble on them a bit.  ;)
 
We were benchmarking our new beta setup - Apache 2, PHP 5, and APC 3 - and seeing absolutely terrible results.  Really, really bad.  Atrocious.  As in, I had momentary fears we'd have to pick between a rewrite in PHP 4 or double the size of our webserver farm to manage it.
 
Anyways, while I can't reveal the exact results (and since they're using our in-house apps they wouldn't help much anyways) but under a load of 12,000 simultaneous simulated users (approximately 600 page views/ second), we were seeing page load times averaging over 20 seconds per page during our test on Tuesday morning - obviously completely unusable on a production website.
 
Friday morning we re-ran the test and got it down into the sub-4 seconds per-page range.
 
What changed?
 
Amazingly, while I did tweak some settings here and there, and we did nudge a few things in the code, the biggest change?  We downgraded our servers from Red Hat Enterprise 4 Update 3 to Update 2.  That was it.  Approximately 90% of the difference in the two tests came from that one shift - a shift that should have been completely inconsequential.
 
Now, before you ask - we build our own Apache/PHP/APC binaries, so none of those would have been changed.  We still haven't isolated it to any specific issue, but *something* changed drastically on the OS side, something that absolutely killed performance.  Until we can isolate it, and fix/remote/work-around it, we're officially standardizing on RHEL 4U2 - and I advise anyone out there who is running RHEL and considering moving to Update 3 to test it thoroughly before embarking on that journey.  It should be harmless, but in our case, it was anything but.
 
(On the flip side, U3 fixes several critical bugs in multipath-tools, so we've had to upgrade some of our DBs to it.  We haven't noticed any major performance degredation w/ Oracle, which is good.)
