exec() returns a string.

The string returned is the last line of output from whatever system
command you exec'd, which may or may not be very useful to you.

$strResult = exec('cat myLongTextFile.txt');

will give you the last line of that text file.  You can optionally set
the argument to the exec() function to capture all the output of the
system command, but that's not what you're asking, so excuse me for
being pedantic.

The passthru() command is capable of returning the return code of the
system call.  As noted in the manual http://php.net/passthru

void passthru ( string command [, int &return_var] )

For some of the special return codes that are possible from the BASH
environment, see http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html

If you need more information about the process that you're trying to
run, including the return code, you might have better luck with the
proc_open() function which is pretty nifty.

Good luck.

Greg,

Thanks for the reply. But after nobody replied yesterday, I pretty
much figured it all out. ;-) passthru() does return error codes.. and
apparently it can send error codes from a variety of places.. i've
recieved operating system errors codes if it can't find the specified
program... but it took me a while to figure out it also returns the
error codes of the application you are trying to execute... once i
figured that out, everything went fine. ;-)

> The passthru() command is capable of returning the return code of the
> system call.

When I see comments like this, I assume systems calls meaning things
like 'stat'.. not things like 'unzip'. ;-) So that's slightly
confusing, especially when you're not sure if the error codes are
coming from the OS or the program you are executing.

thanks.

Damned god suggestion indeed.  Killed ALL my extensions, with the plan to
add them one by one to figure out which one was the culprit.  Alas... The
problem continues.

I've also removed the content disposition header completely.  I'm about to
try re-installing FF.  But I rely want to know if this is just my one
installation of Firefox 1.5 or if I'm going to be dealing with such a thing
all day every day as it's downloaded by millions across the globe.

Here's the php gif:
http://counter.enobrev.com/ff_tester.php 

Here's the output:
http://counter.enobrev.com/output.txt

Here's the actual gif:
http://counter.enobrev.com/count.gif

In case anybody wants to see it in action.  Also, I've added ip address to
the output line (since there may be more than one trying this out).

Here's the code:
-----------------
require_once 'function.file_put_contents.php';
require_once 'function.get.ip.php';
file_put_contents('./output.txt', get_ip() . ': ' . date('m/d/Y G:i:s') . ':
' . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "\n");
    
header('Content-Type: image/gif');
readfile('./count.gif');
-----------------

Also, the original version of this was using file_get_contents.. And then I
tried good ol fopen.  readfile just seemed to be the most direct route.

Thanks, all, for your comments and suggestions

Mark

Also, pardon the typos, this wireless keyboard's gotta go...



Here's a repost of the code (with proper newlines)

require_once 'function.file_put_contents.php';

require_once 'function.get.ip.php';

file_put_contents('./output.txt',
	get_ip() . ': ' . date('m/d/Y G:i:s') . ': ' .

header('Content-Type: image/gif');

Ok, this is me:
209.11.29.178: 12/01/2005 11:08:39: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows
NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Only one hit from FF 1.5 on Windows... but then, I might be using RC2
still, I don't remember seeing FF update to the full 1.5 release.

I saw that.  User agent's the same.  I just removed FF, rebooted,
re-downloaded and installed.  Same Problem.  Such a strange thing.  I have
some deadlines to keep, so I have to put this down for a bit.  I'm just
going to keep the header caching for now.

Thanks for the time, suggestions and trials.  I'll post if I ever figure out
what the problem is.

Very curious indeed.

Same behavior with Flock and older Mozilla Firebird 0.7, so a FF 
reinstall probably won't help you.

Depending on OS and other factors, removing and reinstalling Firefox might
not have done anything whatsoever to which plugins are installed and
running.  Be careful about what you assume.

Hmmm, subsequent requests by FF result in the double hit.

Mark, have you considered that maybe this is once for HEAD request to
see if the image changed since the last request, and once for GET when
nothing definitive comes back from HEAD?

If you add $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] to the output, we might solve this.

Absolutely, I'd removed the entire folder post-uninstall.  I hadn't killed
registry entries though.  May try that next.

Nope. I was all excited about that, too. Okay, will try to forget...

in the line very near the bottom:
imagejpeg($dest);
this function takes a third parameter, which is an integer (1-100)
representing the quality of the output file.  (The second parameter is
optional, skip it with two apostrophes) Of course, the higher the number,
the higher quality the image is - of course, along with the filesize being
larger, too.
I use around 50 - 60 for thumbnails, because, c'mon, the image quality of a
thumbnail is really NOT that important.  It's the large image where quality
counts.
anyway, change the line to something like this:
imagejpeg($dest, '', 80);

Note that the imagepng() function does not support an output quality
parameter, nor does the imagegif() function.  So if you want to adjust image
quality, stick with jpg's.

Cheers.

As far as I know, FF doesn't store anything interesting in the 
registry. It seems you're using MS Outlook and I'll just assume that 
you're using Windows XP.

FF stores all your settings to your "profile". Pretty much all 
recent extensions install into your profile directory. Your profile 
directories will not be removed even if you uninstall the FF. You 
can create an another profile for FF without removing you existing 
one. See e.g. http://kb.mozillazine.org/Command_line_arguments

If you're wondering where the profile is stored by default, then 
look here: http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/profile

No need to guess, just RTFM.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ctype_digit in PHP 5.1.x
Message-ID: <43906CDC.9060606@crisscott.com>

Hello,

Can someone with PHP 5.1 installed run a little test for me? We are 
still running 5.0.3 and the sys admin has been dragging his feet about 
updating. If my problem is fixed in 5.1 I think I can get him to upgrade 
much more quickly. Anyway, the problem is with ctype_digit returning 
true for null strings. Can someone with 5.1 let me know the output of 
this line:

var_dump(ctype_digit(''));

There is a comment on the manual page that says it shouldn't return true 
for versions since 4.4.1, but that is just a comment. I can't find any 
bug reports for it and I don't want to create one unless the issue still 
exists in the latest version.

Thanks for the help,

There is no such thing as a null string, because null is not a string. I 
think you mean the empty string, based on your example:

Why would this be considered a bug?

The ctype_digit() function returns true if every character in a string 
is a digit. The length of the string seems like a separate criterion.

It would be a bug because it doesn't function as one would expect. The 
manual says, " Returns TRUE if every character in text is a decimal 
digit, FALSE otherwise." Since there are no characters, they cannot be 
decimal digits. Therefore, I would expect the "FALSE otherwise" to kick 
in. If it said, "Returns FALSE if the string contains non-decimal 
characters" I might agree with you. It may just be semantics, but do you 
really expect ctype_digit('') to return TRUE?

Anyway, I decided not to be such a dummy and just downloaded the Windows 
version. In 5.1.1 (on Windows at least), ctype_digit('') returns false.

Thanks,
Scott

As a non-c programmer (and therefore someone without expectations
about how such a function should work) I have to agree that this seems
like a bug to me, too, and it's one of the main reasons why I don't
use the ctype functions for validation.

An empty string is not a digit.

Nevertheless, it is well documented that the ctype functions return
TRUE on empty values, so if you're going to use them you have to
expect it.

Not actually a bug, but a brain-dead feature.

So yeah, it appears to be as expected now.  However, ctype_digit() is really
just a wrapper around the native C functions, so the setlocale() and family
of libs are something to consider.  The above script I did produces the same
output on Fedora and Windows, but man setlocale and man isdigit could also
cover it.

I wouldn't call this well documented.  While the sentence "When called 
with an empty string the result will always be TRUE" appears on the ctype 
function reference page, http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.ctype.php, who 
looks at that?  This should be stated on each ctype function's page.  For 
example, it's not listed on ctype_digit(), http://www.php.net/ctype_digit.

Now Hans' test shows that the behavior isn't what's documented.  Seems 
like some research is in order.  Scott, want to go the distance? :)  
Please?

First, look through the cvs commit list / cvs change logs to see if the 
change in 5.1 was intentional.  If it was not, open a bug about the 
change.

Second, check the relevant documentation out from CVS.  Adjust the 
documentation files as needed to explain the state of affairs then make a 
patch via (cvs diff -u).  Put the patch on a website somewhere.  Open up a 
documentation bug pointing to the patch file.

To get the CVS sources for the docs...
Login:
  cvs -d :pserver:cvsread at cvs.php.net:/repository login
Password is:
  phpfi

Checkout (all on one line):
  cvs -d :pserver:cvsread at cvs.php.net:/repository checkout 
    phpdoc/en/reference/ctype

If you need help understanding DocBook XML, let me know.

YOU DA MAN!!!

May I please suggest a few things?

The docs generally use the &false; entity instead of 
<literal>FALSE</literal>.

Seems like an explanation of the pre-5.1 and post-5.1 return values would 
be most helpful in the returnvalues refsect.  I'm trying to think of a 
good example of where return values have changed over time to see how it's 
documented there, but I can't recall one right now.  The ones thought of 
so far have changed parameters.

Finally, the change needs to be noted in the main chapter reference, 
phpdoc/en/reference/ctype/reference.xml.

Thanks soooo much,

--Dan

Sorry, not used to that one. We don't have that one defined over in the 
PHP-GTK docs, or at least we don't use it.

I'll leave that one to the pros. I added your suggestion to the bug report.

As part of the AMP vertical, ie for running PHP, I'd say no.  I don't see
any significant features that would be pertinent to a PHP application that
would outweigh moving to a new code base.  However, over time, I think the
shift will be there, especially once PHP TS and related issues are reduced.
Even now, in certain configurations of PHP, Apache2/PHP could make sense.

That said, outside of PHP - for instance proxies, DAV, etc. - I'd go with
Apache 2, but still would give a new release like 2.2 some time.

Thought experiment: you are using a Perl module called Log::Trivial
(http://search.cpan.org/~atrickett/Log-Trivial-0.03/lib/Log/Trivial.pm) to
log to a file. It uses flock() internally. You are also using php's native
error_log() to write to the same log file. Is this asking for trouble?
Does log_error() flock() internally, and will it honor a Perl flock()? I
am guessing both flock implementations wrap the same underlying C stuff,
about which I know little, hence the question.

Thanks.

I ain't much of a Perl guru, but flock() is bad for concurrency. For a
lot of simultaneous access you'll be drastically reducing performance.

I guess yes.

> Does log_error() flock() internally, and will it honor a Perl flock()?

No AFAIK, PHP log_error() does an append, but it will honor a Perl
flock() where in lies the problem.

You can have many concurrent appenders without any locking, atomicty is
guranteed courtesy of the file system. But when you have a flock, you
can have only one writer.

So, if your PERL code doesn't release locks soon enough, your PHP code
will wait till the lock is freed, this will unnecessarily reduce
response time. If you can get your Perl code to do an append like PHP,
you'll get atomic updates without the overhead of locking.

What you are suggesting is safe, but at times the contraption may turn
out to be slow.

*chop*

Hmmm... what are the features they *really* need? I really like Yahoo
Groups, over MSN and Google.

If you are talking plain mailing lists like this one, the GNU Mailman or
ezmlm is a great option.

For other stuff like community pages, photo sharing etc. you may already
have other stuff in PHP/Perl/Python. Or you could try rolling your own
code ;).

Sounds like they might need Clew, Michael.

Oh well, never mind. Google groups has a great interface if you're a geek.

Hmmm, are we casting aspersions on my contraption here (-; ? Maybe I'll
just abandon the shared logfile idea -- not that much of an upside to it
anyway.

Hello Everyone,

I know this is off-topic but this problem is driving me totally nuts and I
am hoping somone here will take a moment to answer this post:

I have a db table called 'sisters'. I am wanting to select ONE RANDOM record
from that table but I want to exclude a specific record from that random
selection. Here is the sql I'm using:

SELECT * FROM sisters WHERE email !='email_address_to_exclude' ORDER BY
RAND() LIMIT 1"

However, every time I insert my WHERE clause, I am told by MySQL that there
is an error in my syntax. I've replaced the != with NOT and it makes no
difference. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks!

Not so much - but there is also a MySQL-SIG - http://www.nyphp.org/lists

The typical SQL syntax for not-equal is <>  (that's less-than followed by
greater-than).

[re-adjusting no quoting]

> > IS NOT LIKE

In this case, MySQL will interpret NOT LIKE the same as <> assuming there
are no special chars.  So it's important to note if there are any type of
wildcards.  For instance, a percent sign will cause your expression to act
differently in a variation of LIKE vs. a basic string match using a
variation of an equal sign.  And not all databases (IIRC) do this, so you
should always use a strict match unless you want wildcards to sneak in.

Anthony, and everyone, the manual is your friend.  There's a whole section

IS NOT LIKE will function completely fine within the code he displayed
below, see Hans' reply.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my SQL syntax question. However, for
some strange reason, I am STILL getting an error. So far, I've modified my
SQL statement the following ways:

SELECT * FROM sisters WHERE email != 'email address' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1

SELECT * FROM sisters WHERE email NOT 'email address' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT
1

SELECT * FROM sisters WHERE email NOT LIKE 'email address' ORDER BY RAND()
LIMIT 1

SELECT * FROM sisters WHERE email IS NOT LIKE 'email address' ORDER BY
RAND() LIMIT 1

SELECT * FROM sisters WHERE email <> 'email address' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1

None, of these statements work and yet they all look (at least to me)
syntactically correct. Could this be a problem with my db server??

try

select * from sisters where email <> 'email address' order by 
rand(unix_timestamp()) limit 1;

However, this page mentions that using rand may not be the best idea.

You seems have problem with your db server or sql execution mechanism. Because all queries except 2nd & 4th are correct and will run successfully on mysql DB. However results may vary from query to query.

Thanks

When my keyboard layout is US English International (with dead keys) I
have sometimes gotten weird but unprintable characters near the quotes in
my SQL queries while working a terminal window with the mysql client. The
query appears syntactically flawless and yet it fails. I retype --
carefully -- the quoted parts, and then it works.

First, "IS" should not be in there.  The operator is "NOT LIKE".  Second, 
just because something works doesn't make it the right way to do 
something.

Hi there:

I built and maintain a shopping site.  They've asked me to implement 
a gift certificate feature, and I was wondering what strategies 
people use to create gift certificate codes which can be emailed?

Just initially researching it, and though I'd toss it out for the 
excellent minds here to chime in on if they've already had good 
solutions; need to obviously make sure we have a unique code for each 
one and so forth.

Thanks much,

Check with the payment gateway that you are using. Some of them have 
this type of thing already set up. You can use a slightly modified API 
to create and redeem the codes. I know that CyberSource offers gift 
certificates an I am sure that others do to.

Why would you need a third party? Security? Fault tolerance. Why not just 
store gift certificate values & IDs in a table in the shopping cart? A 
unique gift certificate row id can be easily turned into a hash. And InnoBD 
can be used to ensure the integrity of balance transactions.

If you are already using a third party to process credit card payments 
it is easier to use their gift certificate interface than it is to 
create your own. Instead of creating new tables in the database, a new 
class to verify and process the codes, and a backend to manage the codes 
for the customer support team, you just add a check for the payment type 
and then call a different method.

Debugging is a breeze because you only have a few new lines, whereas 
with a home grown system you need to do some serious testing to make 
sure that your system is secure and functions properly. With someone 
else's service you might even be able to be up and running with a few 
days left for the last minute holiday shoppers.

Also, it probably won't cost near as much to use a provider that you are 
already working with. There will probably be no or little set up fee. Of 
course there will be a small fee per transaction but it will take a few 
years before those add up the development costs it will take to build 
your own system.

If anyone isn't familiar with this, it's worth a read:

http://www.dagbladet.no/development/phpcodingstandard/

Nice PHP Coding Standard Guide. I love the part about no magic #s. I would 
make it required reading for any new team member.

My only issue is preceding a Class property name with m as in 
$mClassProperty. m makes me think of method. I'd prefer p for property. 
Thoughts?

I would be very hesitant to recommend this standard.  I do have a 
particular hate for StudlyCaps so it turned me off right there, however 
the fact is that it hasn't been revised since 2003 and is quite out of date.

There are several references to the old-style $HTTP_*_VARS arrays, and 
no mention of using the superglobal arrays, magic quotes, no discussion 
of single vs double quotes, etc.

That said, many of the more general observations about things such as 
commenting code and using a source management system are very useful, I 
don't know what I would do without SVN (or CVS) for any decent sized 
project.

A more esoteric complaint would be that I prefer tabs over spaces, 
because it allows the developer to control the way code is indented (2 
vs 4 vs 8 etc spaces), and avoids the all-too-common situation of the 
indenting being off by 1 space.  That said, tabs should only be used 
before any text on a line, trailing comments or spacing of assignment 
blocks should be indented with spaces to maintain the layout independent 
of tab spacing settings.

WRT <?php ?> tags, I have embraced a practice I first heard of on this 
list, which is to leave out the end ?> tag and instead use a standard 
comments line like:

// end of script

followed by a single newline (unix-style \n of course)

This avoids the situation where the trailing whitespace after the ?> in 
one of your included files sends output to the browser and breaks all 
your header() and cookie() calls.

The final comment I would give is that the authors refer to 
double-quotes as 'magic quotes' throughout the document.  Considering 
the special meaning of this phrase in PHP this is a very poor choice of 
wording.

 Class Names

   of a word
   - First character in a name is upper case
   - No underbars ('_')

underbar? is that like underwire? or did they mean underscore?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] virus scans and php
Message-ID: <43971AEF.8040708@aarond.com>

I'm working on an Image Database where public users would submit images 
through an html form then the images and related form info would be sent 
to a private network. The info then goes to an Oracle db, and based on 
the unique id's given to the records in the db I rename the images and 
place in a temp folder.

The issue of running some type of virus scan outside of php file checks 
on the images came up in a meeting and I wasn't sure what to say.  Is 
there some type of way a virus scan software can talk to php? Or another 
way to handle virus scans and file uploads?

We have win2k servers and PHP 4.3.1

thanks,

Seems like you could pass to ClamAV for processing... except I don't
know if that's Linux only.

Then again, image handling libraries try very hard not to execute
anything embedded in the image, so your only concern is someone
downloading an infected image, changing the extension to .exe, and
then double-clicking it.

Seriously, if embedded viruses are a problem, we're all screwed. It's
not irresponsible to say "not my job" in this case.

It's not as straightforward as on linux, but it works.

Yea I hear ya, but the boss man wants virus scan. I may have to have a 
temp wait time & directory to allow McAfee or some other crappy 
application to scan the directory before moving the files.

Message-ID: <a9caffe50512071630i4714e64k95135bdd7741a731@mail.gmail.com>

I have inherited a .NET app that I am converting over to PHP/MySQL.
The first big hurdle is to convert the database.

I have setup SQL Server Express 2005 and done a restore of the DB, so
I can at least see the structure and the data.

I am trying to use ADODB to connect to the database, but with no luck.
I set SQL server up so that it uses Windows Authentication when I
login (no username/password) required.  The server name is
VAIOLAPTOP\SQLEXPRESS.

I have a database class that I use to create the connection (see
below). I'm sure that whatever it is I don't have correct is simple,
but I cannot find anything via Google that is providing any answers,
so any help would be greatly appreciated. TIA.

<?php

class DB {

	var $conn;
	
	//constructor
	function DB (){
		//include 'adodb/adodb.inc.php';
		$this->conn =& ADONewConnection('mssql');
		if($ip=$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']=='127.0.0.1'){
			$conn=$this->conn->PConnect('localhost','','','ossrc');
			}
			else {
							$conn=$this->conn->PConnect('localhost','','','rsquared_ossrc');
				}
		
		return $conn;
		}
	
	}

Well, that's probably your problem right there.  You're running SQL Server 
(just kidding).  Your problem is probably the "Windows Authentication" 
setting.

Where are you running your PHP scripts from?  If it's via the web server, 
I certainly hope the account the web server is running as doesn't have 
permission to get in.

I have my SQL Server 2000 Authentication set to "SQL Server and Windows."  
This way I can manually specify the user name and password when calling 
mssql_connect() in my scripts.

Regardless of the authentication mechanism, you'll need to have the users 
registerd in the SQL Server's "Logins."

Yes, I am running it from the webserver, which is just running locally
on my laptop.

Bear with me, this is my first time ever even seeing SQL server. There
is a menu item on the tree menu for the database that says 'Users.' I
tried to add a new user, and it won't let me. There are several users
already listed, so I'm assuming that I need to get a valid username
and password from the person who gave me the database.

Once I do that though, don't I still need to enable the mssql
extension in the php.ini file?

A combination of the Filesystem functions

and $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] should get you what you're looking for.

I suppose it's worth mentioning that George Schlossnagle's book
"Advanced PHP" (mentioned 9,431 times on this list) also has some
great programming style suggestions, but its not really a set
standard.

I assume we need to create a general purpose coding standard that can be helpful to member of this group and other as well. We can receive comments, suggestion and input of all members who wants to contribute. After reviewing all input, we can prepare nice  looking coding standard and can place somewhere on Nyphp.org. I assume it can be helpful for other programming languages as well.

Hans, any comments?

Thanks,

In-Reply-To: <5458518f0512052036v4c1eb3bex8b9ffffb030b35a2@mail.gmail.com>
References: <5458518f0512052036v4c1eb3bex8b9ffffb030b35a2@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <4397C464.8080406@simmons.edu>

I need help figuring out an error when writing/loading a custom, shared 
extension (.so) for PHP.
Could anyone help or recommend good links, books, or other mailing lists 
for developing in C to extend PHP?

I have "Building Custom PHP Extensions" by Blake Schwendiman and 
"Advanced PHP Programming" by George Schlossnagle (9432 times mentioned 
on this list). Both excellent books which got me started, but looking 
for more information.  I've been around the Zend Dev site and 
http://talks.php.net/  (http://www.zend.com/apidoc/ as well) but I am stuck.

Thank you.

Background:
-------------
I am writing a script in C that uses shared memory and/or memory-mapped 
files to (attempt to) speed up some frequently used PHP functionality.
I need to test the speed of the extension (using some apache "ab" 
scripts)  in environments where the extension will be loaded via the ini 
rather than being compiled into php.

Summary of Problem:
----------
The extension will compile into PHP 4.4.1 and runs without issue as a 
compiled-in extension.
I can build it into a shared object using phpize for both 4.4.1 source 
and the 4.3.11 binaries.
I get no errors running phpize.
In both the PHP.INI context and dl() context the only error message is  
( it can, at least, find the .so):
"PHP Warning:  Unknown(): Invalid library (maybe not a PHP library) 
'my_ext.so'  in Unknown on line 0"

Details:
-----------
Linux, Fedora Core 4. GCC 4.0.x

dl()  fails to load the .so in CLI with php of the same version (perhaps 
it fails because it is already an internal extension?)
dl() AND loading through the INI fail in a server (Apache 2.0.x) with a 
different version of php (4.3.11)  . php.ini.
(I run phpize that is included with the precompiled 4.3.11 and added the 
3 headers it needs. )
Only error message is at load time ( it can, at least, find the .so):

"PHP Warning:  Unknown(): Invalid library (maybe not a PHP library) 
'my_ext.so'  in Unknown on line 0"

My only guesses are that :
 - something do with my m4 file -
   maybe the PHP_EXTENSION macro since it wasn't present in my m4 file 
but PHP_NEW_EXTENSION is.
  Also I see differences in documentation about PHP_SUBST(xxx_SHARED_LIBADD)

   from winstead's talk:
  PHP_SUBST(TIDY_SHARED_LIBADD)

  PHP_EXTENSION(tidy, $ext_shared)
  dnl PHP_NEW_EXTENSION(tidy, tidy.c, $ext_shared)

  "PHP_EXTENSION(modulename, [shared])This macro is a /must/ to call for 
PHP to configure your extension. You can supply a second argument in 
addition to your module name,   indicating whether you intend 
compilation as a shared module. This will result in a definition at 
compile time for your source as COMPILE_DL_<modulename>."
- something to do with dl() not allowing certain kinds of functionality 
of an .so 
- also in the m4 file I am not clear whether to use --enable or --with . 
I have several source files, but using enable works fine with built in 
extension.
- the standard distro doesn't let me run buildconf (even with --force it 
fails), so will my updated m4 get put into configure?
- the .so has to be compiled for each and every version of PHP (doesn't 
seem right )

The way MS SQL works is similar to MySQL.

The top level of the security system are SQL SERVER "Logins".  This 
controls who can even connect to the server.

Then at the DATABASE level, you use the "Users" section to determine which 
of the server "Logins" are allowed to connect to that particular database.

Yeah, it's just that I've never used anything but MySQL, so it's
difficult to try to get things done quickly when some things are
different (terminology, UI, etc.).

Long story short, here is my process:

1. Query data in MSSQL
2. Copy and Paste into OpenOffice spreadsheet
3. Save as .csv
4. Import into MySQL

Thanks for answering my questions though. It was very helpful.

Is this php app going to be running on a windows machine?  I had a client
who had a site on a linux machine and was communicating to a remote mssql
database and it was nearly impossible to get it to work, i fought and fought
until i found FreeTDS.  Using FreeTDS locally i got it to work but trying to
find a shared host to install FreeTDS was impossible.  The only way to get
this to work for them was for them to get a dedicated machine and for that
matter to make things easy they got a windows machine.  I had no problem
communication from windows to windows using the mssql_* php functions.

*chop*

The good thing about standards is that there's so many of them to choose
from. And new ones come up every now and then ;).

The standard as it isn't really as important as getting your dev team to
follow it. Most standards do end up getting altered, to become another
standard for a particular project.

By far, I found the PEAR coding guidelines most widely followed. But do
we really need another standard?

ah

No, but it's really irrelevant. I'm converting the MSSQL DB to MySQL.
The whole issue was in needing to query and extract the data from the
original database. I figured it all out.

glad you figured it out, i know you were trying to query that's why i asked
if you were hosting the php script on linux trying to communicate with mssql
because that is impossible without FreeTDS.

The Javascript function getElementsByTagName('meta') will get an array
of all the meta tags in the current webpage.

Take the following javascript, make it the 'href' attribute of a
hyperlink in your document, and you have a bookmarklet that will do
the trick.

javascript:metaTags=document.getElementsByTagName('meta');total='<h1>MetaTags:</h1><ol>';for(i=0;i<metaTags.length;i++){total=total+'<li><strong>name:</strong>%C2%A0'+metaTags[i].name+'<br

What about Hungarian notation?  I had not heard of it till I recently 
started my new job.  I find the naming convention useful, especially 
when all our database fields have the corresponding notations.  I'm sure 
this coding standard could be used for other languages that do not 
require data types to be declared.  But is this something that should be 
included within the PHP coding standard?

Gack! Not in my code, thanks. Names are names, not type declarations.

But if you like it, more power to ya. I hope you're consistent, and
have a well-defined list of types in your coding standard so that
whatever poor bloke has to change the code in 5 years can figure out
what all the notations mean.

If it doesn't follow a well recorded, defined list of types, it isn't
"Hungarian".  On one hand, I've often found it useful to distinguish
between parameters ($p_) and local vairables ($l_) in my functions and
methods, on the other hand, it kind of defeats the purpose of
auto-complete, since all your variable names begin with a small set of
notations. On some occasions I've even found it useful to go so far as
to add notation for keys ($k_) and values ($v_) in my longer loops,
but that is definitelly not "Hungarian". I can't really ever recall a
time where the type hinting character ever helped me out, but maybe
someday... That being said, type and scope hinting in a name can be
useful, and as far as I'm concerned are as much an indication of what
a thing is as some arbitrary label, in fact, it can often make your
names shorter and more to the point. For example compare taking an
input array of $p_aNames, looping through them as $v_sName and
building some local array for return in $l_aNames against using
longer, studlyier names for the "Name" to differentiate them, such as
$NamesInput, $NameFromLoop, $NamesOutput. Typically, on a project, I
wait until it is late and I've had a few beers to start naming things
anyway, so anyone following my example is probably in deep trouble.

the "Name" to differentiate them, such as $NamesInput, $NameFromLoop,
$NamesOutput. Typically, on a project, I wait until it is late and I've
had a few beers to start naming things anyway, so anyone following my
example is probably in deep trouble.

In the end, coding standards are much like the vermouth in Winston
Churchill's Martini recipe:
6 parts gin
Bottle of dry vermouth
Cocktail olive

Shake gin in a cocktail shaker with cracked ice. Strain into a chilled
cocktail glass and look at the bottle of vermouth. Garnish with olive.

You should be familiar with them, understand what they are trying to
convey, and know when to keep them the hell out of your cocktail.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] "Calling" an object
Message-ID: <20051210040834.GM14182@desario.homelinux.net>

I want to reproduce the equivalent of Python's magic __call__ method in
PHP 5.  More or less this might look like:

    class foo {
        function __call__() { return "bar"; }
    }

    $o = new foo();
    $s = $o();
    // $s = "bar"

But of course, that doesn't work.  Using __toString() doesn't quite cut it as
that only works w/ echo & print.

Ideas?

Regards,
Andrew

Subject: [nycphp-talk] if statement expression evaluation question
Message-ID: <000001c5fdcd$0fe38860$0ca8a8c0@CHirschLaptop>

I have been looking through the PHP manual for a definitive answer
regarding expression evaluation in an if statement, specifically
regarding the following:

$array = array('a' => 'alpha', 'b' => 'beta', 'c' => 'charlie');
if (isset($array['d']) && ($array['d'] === 'delta'))
  echo 'Its a wonderful life';

This is ok, but the following will generate a parse error:

if (($array['d'] === 'delta') && isset($array['d'])) 

Obviously the first example doesn't evaluate the 2nd expression,
eliminating the non-existent key parsing error. My question is, can I
rely on this? Is the precedence and abortion of the balance of the if
expression guaranteed in this and future releases of PHP?

This is known as 'short-circuit' evaluation, and AFAIK it is definitely 
reliable, because it is the most efficient way to evaluate the statement 
so there would be no reason to modify the behaviour.

Learn the difference between "Apps Hungarian" and "Systems 
Hungarian". I'd support former but there's no way I'd use latter for 
anything.

http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html

"But then something kind of wrong happened.

The dark side took over Hungarian Notation.

Nobody seems to know why or how, but it appears that the 
documentation writers on the Windows team inadvertently invented 
what came to be known as Systems Hungarian."

Interesting reading - a bit longish, though.

Message-ID: <200512121736.jBCHaaME012121@ms-smtp-03.rdc-nyc.rr.com>

I'm currently running PHP 4.3 and MySQL 4.0. I'm planning my migration path
to PHP 5 and MySQL 5. The question is, can I migrate each product
individually, and if so, which should/must be migrated first. For stability
reasons, I'd rather not have to migrate both at the same time, and I'd
really prefer to upgrade MySQL first. Can PHP 4.3 connect to MySQL 5 at all?
Has anyone else been down this path?
 
Thanks!
Lance

Yes - and it's a very delicate path.

Without knowing anything about your application, I'd lean towards upgrading
PHP first.  Focus on the application code first - it's what does the work;
the database will continue to serve data, regardless.  In addition, MySQL
5.0 requires new client libs for the most part, of which PHP 4.3 isn't
always the most comfortable with and the new object model (among other
things) in PHP 5 may through your application into some unexpected behavior.
As a first step, in a development environment, upgrade to PHP 5.1 and test,
test, test your application against a database of the same schema and
version.

Im returning back from legacy Java hell and catching up on PHP5/

stuff on phpdb.org until I ran into Qcodo which was also pretty cool/

the Zend webcast and trying to figure out if it might be worth it to  
hold off a tad bit till some "Z"APIs come out before setting all of  
this up.  (And if there is anything else recommended I should look at).

Thanks!

Hey Jon.
Have you read this? http://www.qcodo.com/documentation/article.php/6
Also in the forums there are 2 or 3 threads that will enlighten you, because
Mike Ho works closely  with Zend and has some good insights.
Like this one: http://www.qcodo.com/forums/topic.php/7
HTH, if not drop a line on the forums and you will be surprised by the
extent of Mike's answers about his baby qcodo.

Cheers,

When I first moved to New York I listed with a recruiting agency and the 
recruiter I was working with told me she had never heard of PHP and said 
that there were no jobs for php-developers and JAVA was by far a better 
programming language.  Of course I had no problem finding php jobs on 
various websites and had two jobs offers before she had even managed to 
contact me about an interview.  I feel like emailing her the link.

When I was about to move to NYC in mid-2000 I spoke with a head hunter 
just before the bubble burst and asked him what the hot technologies were. 
 He told me that he had just placed two PHP developers to the highest 
paying jobs he'd ever arranged. 

That was the first I ever heard of PHP and bought my first book a few 
hours later.  :)

The company that I work for is primarily a Java shop. The global HR
director sent out an email the other day regarding some new jobs that
were available. One of the requirements was something called JAVA
SCRIPT.

There are a lot of people, especially in the public sector
environment, who still think that Java is king, and couldn't tell you
the difference between Java and Javascript.

Guys,

A client of mine recently asked how they could get results like this in
google

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=craftster&btnG=Google+Search

Look at the first result, they have links to thier blog, picture gallery,
etc..  Is that something you have to setup in google or is that based on the
description tag, which for that site i see to be

<meta name="description" content="Craftster.org Picture Hosting" />
<meta name="description" content="Craftster.org Classifieds" />


Thanks,

Google Base, which is already the largest spam dump since Froogle.

Make a faux blog for your commercial website, and viola, Google promotes it.
Add fake "user galleries" that are simply your own product images, and 
Google promotes it.
Everybody knows that user-contributed "classifieds" are an AdSense 
magnet. Add those, too.

It does require someone taking ownership of the site, which assigns an 
IP etc. which Google can then use to tie websites together, uncover link 
networks and the like, so I can assume the spaminess won't last forever. 
But then again, Google Base may not last forever, either.

Your client should tread lightly in the SEO world right now.... there is 
plenty of baiting going on.

PHP is a scripting language. JAVA is a real language.
JAVA is a serious professional language capable of enterprise 
applications, not just web sites. It is too hard for most script 
programmers.
Therefore they also have JAVA SCRIPT, which is like a lightweight JAVA, 
made for script coders (like PHP coders who have graduated to something 
more serious, but aren't yet ready for the complexity of JAVA).

Right?

What?

No.

Java and Javascript have nothing to do with each other.

No, they actually meant Javascript. The guy doesn't know the
difference. Neither have any of the people in my company to whom I
have reported to over the years. There is this thought pattern the the
company that developers who know Java know everything. This is a prime
example of just how wrong that train of thought is.

I've never thought java was anymore difficult than php.  In fact JAVA 
was the first programming language I learned in college in my 
introductory computer sciences courses before moving on to C.  I picked 
up PHP because it seemed like a simple and fast web development language 
that gave me the flexibility to communicate with MySQL and Flash 
Actionscript.

And JAVA and Javascript are nothing alike.  Javascript was made by 
someone at Netscape, not Sun.  And it wasn't even called Javascript at 
first.  Bleh, I could go on and on about the difference but I have work 
to do.

I do enjoy the irony. Randal makes a jest about people not understanding 
the difference between Javascript/java and someone had to illustrate the 
point for us.  *bravo*

To clear up a couple more common misconceptions about the two languages...

Java is not an acronym (bad: JAVA)
JavaScript has a capped S (bad: Javascript, javascript, JAVA SCRIPT)

Ah.   I feel better now.   Back to coding pHp.  Oops.  :)

Hi All,

Having read John's posts here for a couple of years, my guess is his 
tongue was planted so firmly in cheek that some people didn't notice. 
If I'm right, I guess the fact that someone took him literally just 
reflects how common such a "javascript == java light for script kiddies" 
attitude is.  Nice, John.  :o)

Fair enough.

This has all interested me enough to go look up the earliest reference
to JavaScript on the Netscape site in the IA, and lo and behold! It
claims that JavaScript is "based on the Java language".

Actually, Dan, for all those IE sluts out there it isn't even
JavaScript, but JScript. Or, if they've really drank the coolaid,
JScript .NET

No, for the love of all that is holy, do forget VBscript. I have, and

I do apologize if anyone forwarded that to their boss as authoritative. 
If it creates problems, I'll search optimize your resume for free on the 
phrases of your choice :-)

Actually, I was playing with Java when the javascript stuff started. 
There seemed to be a very deliberate tie of js to Java, for the 
promotional effect in the market place. At that time Java was very 
young/small, but wildly popular, and it wasn't a big stretch to relate 
LiveScript to Java because there were indeed syntactical similarities 
(at the time) -- perhaps one of the biggest similarities being that they 
were both quite different from C/C++ and HTML. So LiveScript was renamed 
javascript to keep it alive as "new" and "fresh" and "worthy". I guess 
it worked.

Whenever I read that a recruiter said X was better than Y, I am urged to 
sell pieces of the Brooklyn Bridge, or tickets to the secret "Acoustic 
Elvis" show (it's a little known secret that Elvis lives, and still 
performs live on Monday nights at the NightLight Lounge in 
Bellingham,Washington). Of course there really are no pieces of the 
Brooklyn Bridge for sale (all of the pieces sink into the river 
immediately after falling off - duh.) and likewise every Bellingham 
local knows the NightLight Lounge closes to the public for the Elvis 
shows - there are no tickets to sell.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] status of large file uploads
Message-ID: <3D70C97A-9D8F-4A6E-AAA2-FD6BA9D2CA47@domanistudios.com>

I'm trying to build a simple AJAX file upload progress bar. I'm  
running into some trouble getting access to the file information that  
I need.

I've seen a couple of different strategies for tackling this problem.

1. patching PHP so that it has a callback handler in the file upload  
methods
http://pdoru.from.ro/

2. Watching the tmp upload directory for file size updates
http://lixlpixel.org/ajax-upload-progress/
http://www.devpro.it/upload_progress/

3. Using a perl cgi-script to monitor the files
http://sourceforge.net/projects/megaupload/


I don't like option #1 because I don't want to have to patch my  
installation of php. I don't mind #2, but I need to support  
concurrent uploads, so this one is out of the running. I'm also loath  
to use #3, because I'm not a huge fan of perl, and it seems like PHP  
should be able to handle it.

A further frustration is that the $_FILES array seems to populate  
_after_ the file is finished uploading. I had hoped to grab the $_FILE 
['tmp_name'] early, and then monitor the file via filesystem calls. I  
had also kicked around using ini_set('tmp_upload_dir') to a dynamic  
folder and then scanning over that folder like option #2, but the  
ini_set would apply to all uploads, and not just the one I want to  
monitor (which means no concurrent uploads).

Are there any other sneaky ways to either 1. get (or set) the  
tmp_name of a file so it can be watched, or 2. another means entirely  
of watching the progress.

Any help would be appreciated.

thanks,

-corey

If you aren't afraid of Flash 8 you can integrate PHP with a Flash 
progress bar:

Folks:
I apologize if this has been covered before, but this is a difficult thing
to Google.  I'd like my PHP script to use values that come from a JavaScript
script.  I'm thinking that I could probably have the .js set a cookie to be
read by the .php, but I'm wondering if anyone has come across a more elegant
solution than this.

Also, I'm putting together an Amazon wish list; are there any JavaScript
books that anyone would consider essential reading?

Thanks.

you are probaby looking for is in the 2nd page under the "HIDDEN INPUT

Chris,

Here's a snippet I've used to have PHP and JavaScript communicate via 
cookies.  View it with Firefox so the HTML doesn't get parsed:
http://krook.org/etc/js-cookie-php.txt

As for books, these have served me well and are highly rated at Amazon as 
well.  All are O'Reilly books:
JavaScript: The Definitive Guide (the Rhino)
JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook
Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference 

HTH,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] status of large file uploads


I'm trying to build a simple AJAX file upload progress bar. I'm  
running into some trouble getting access to the file information that  
I need.

I've seen a couple of different strategies for tackling this problem.

1. patching PHP so that it has a callback handler in the file upload  
methods
http://pdoru.from.ro/

2. Watching the tmp upload directory for file size updates
http://lixlpixel.org/ajax-upload-progress/
http://www.devpro.it/upload_progress/

3. Using a perl cgi-script to monitor the files
http://sourceforge.net/projects/megaupload/


I don't like option #1 because I don't want to have to patch my  
installation of php. I don't mind #2, but I need to support  
concurrent uploads, so this one is out of the running. I'm also loath  
to use #3, because I'm not a huge fan of perl, and it seems like PHP  
should be able to handle it.

A further frustration is that the $_FILES array seems to populate  
_after_ the file is finished uploading. I had hoped to grab the $_FILE 
['tmp_name'] early, and then monitor the file via filesystem calls. I  
had also kicked around using ini_set('tmp_upload_dir') to a dynamic  
folder and then scanning over that folder like option #2, but the  
ini_set would apply to all uploads, and not just the one I want to  
monitor (which means no concurrent uploads).

Are there any other sneaky ways to either 1. get (or set) the  
tmp_name of a file so it can be watched, or 2. another means entirely  
of watching the progress.

Any help would be appreciated.

thanks,

-corey

Hi Andrew,

Andrew Yochum wrote:
> I want to reproduce the equivalent of Python's magic __call__ method in

That's a great question.  In Python, the magic __call__ method defines the 
behavior of an object when the object is "called like a method".

>     class foo {
>         function __call__() { return "bar"; }

Unfortunately, you can't do this in the PHP global scope, as your example and 
this one demonstrate:

<?php
$o = new stdClass();  // or anything other than a string
$o();
?>

This will raise a fatal error (function name must be string), which is not 
interceptable.  PHP thinks you are trying to use a "variable function".

However, you probably won't be using most of your code in the global scope 
anyway, so there is still some hope.  You can do some interesting behaviors by 
using the magic methods __get() and __call() as proxies in a container object.

The __get() magic acts as a proxy for undefined properties of an object. 
Similarly, the __call() magic is a proxy for undefined methods.  By keeping a 
child object as a protected member of a container and returning it only 
through __get(), you can then use __call() as a broker to the child object's 
methods when "it is called like a method".

First, we can set up your class Foo from above, with the "__call__" method:

class Foo {
     public function calledAsMethod($args) {
         return 'bar';
     }

     public function hello() {
         return 'hi';
     }
}

Next, another class is built to contain it.

class Bar {
     /* @var Foo */
     protected $_foo = null;

     public function __construct() {
         $this->_foo = new Foo();
     }

     public function __get($offset) {
         if ($offset=='foo') {
             return $this->_foo;
         } else throw new Exception("Undefined property: $offset");
     }

     public function __call($offset, $args) {
         if ($offset=='foo') {
             return $this->_foo->calledAsMethod($args);
         } else throw new Exception("Undefined method: $offset");
     }
}

Here's how it works:

$bar = new Bar();
echo $bar->foo->hello();  // "hi"  - Foo is returned, Foo::hello() is called
echo $bar->foo();         // "bar" - __call() brokers to calledAsMethod()

This is almost the same functionality as Python's __call__, except that you 
have to access it through the container Bar.

Depending on how you intend to use it, there is a drawback to the code as 
shown above, in that the visibility of Bar's magic property "foo" is always 
public (like the usage examples).  That might be what you want, however it 
isn't if you are only using magic "foo" from inside the scope of Bar (as in 
$this->foo and $this->foo()).  If that's the case, and your Bar class is not 
using __get() or __call() to provide any other public magics, you can set 
their visibility to protected or private.  They will still function within the 
scope of Bar, however calls to the magic property "foo" from outside the scope 
of Bar will then raise a fatal error: Call to protected method Bar::__get().

Mike

Thanks!

Since my message I had come up with a similar solution - using a
container on the top level.  The trick then was to get all properties
and return values of the contained objects to behave the same way, so I
wrap all return values (in __call) and properties (in__get) in a
delegate/decorator that behaves the same was as the container.  Does the
trick nicely!

Thanks again,
Andrew

That sounds good to me.  This is an interesting topic and there are quite a 
few other uses for variations on this theme as well.  The __magics() are very 
powerful.

One of technique that I use is lazy loading expensive objects in __get(), so 
that they are only require()ed and instantiated if they are needed by the 
container object.  It's analogous to __autoload(), except its on the 
class-level instead of the global scope.

Another benefit of __get() proxies is that you can provide immutability for an 
object.  If your object is accessible only through __get(), you can protect it 
from being reassigned (and thus possibly destroyed, depending on refcount) in 
__set().

Where I think it is really gets interesting is when the child object being 
proxied implements the Zend Engine II interfaces ArrayAccess and Iterator. 
You can expose what looks and works exactly like a public property array for 
the end user, and the object underneath can't be destroyed (conventionally). 
You can use these to provide some neat behaviors for nested objects.

If you are on PHP 5.1 already, be sure to check out __isset() and __unset() 
also.  I haven't experimented with these much yet, but I'm sure that there are 
a lot of interesting possibilities for them as well.  Something that comes to 
mind for __unset() would be the emulation of Microsoft's _QueryUnload event 
(pseudo-abortable destruction for your child objects).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] crypt() issue
Message-ID: <43A35BBB.7010008@neuropunks.org>

Hello,
Strange issue, cant figure out what Im doing wrong.

I have users sign up, and then add their password into database after
running
$passwd = crypt($post['passwd1']);
$user->create($post['username'], $passwd, $post['email']);

The user class handles the creation fine, there is a crypt'ed entry in
the password field in the DB.
Then, I am trying to authenticate a user on login like so:

In index.php:
$user->login($post[username], $post[password],
$_SERVER[HTTP_USER_AGENT], 'user');

In classes file for User class:
public function login($username, $password, $user_agent, $realm) {
    $this->username = $username;
    $this->password = $password;
    $sql = "select password from users where username='$this->username'
and admin='f'";
    $db_res = $this->db->Execute($sql);
    if (crypt($this->password, $db_res->fields['password']) !=
$db_res->fields['password']) {
        $this->error = "Invalid username/password ";
        return false;
    } else {
        // set session vars, redirect, etc
    }
}

$post is the processed array of $_POST but its not being modified when
processed, only checked for invalid input and the program will die() if
it doesnt comply.

So basically,
crypt($post['passwd1'])
during signup creates one value, but

crypt($this->password, $db_res->fields['password'])
during authentication returns a different, although always the same, value.

I have exactly same code, in index.php and in classes file and in SQL
command in other apps, and it works without a problem.
I am starting to get lost here, I basically copy/paste all the auth
code, and it stops working.
I checked if input from $_POST is being modified anywhere, and its not.

If anyone wants to see the code in action, look at
http://www.angrycollegekid.com/index.php?a=signup, signup for an account
and then try to login, or just use crap/crap for testing.
There are debugs of what you enter, what first crypt() returns, and what
is actually stored in the DB.

Hi Max,

The first line has the $post array key for password as 'passwd1'
Is that what you wanted?

Yup, thats the first password field from the form, and that code gets called after a check for passwd1 == passwd2

There's not a meeting planned, but we are trying to figure out a good
bar/lounge to meet at as an informal holiday party.  In Jan. we're looking
to have a large holiday party like last year.

So, anyone with recommendations/ideas for a good place in Manhattan?

Definitely and would be a nice compliment to the PHundamentals
(http://www.nyphp.org/phundamentals).

We had begun to do something like this with the code repository, but
maintaining something like this takes a lot of time.  I also take some
notes/comments, but they're by no means ready for public consumption.

That said, we're always happy for volunteers to take a lead in projects, so
Anirudh if interested, then contact me off list and we can talk about
getting started.

This would involve some more debugging, but perhaps here are some things to
keep in mind:

-- you might get symbol conflicts if the extension is compiled in and also
loaded with dl();  do one or the other

-- I've noticed that PHP extensions are quite sensitive to the PHP and Zend
Engine versions.  Be sure you're using the same versions of phpize and the
running PHP.  Pay attention to the top section of phpinfo()'s outout (fields
like PHP API, PHP Extension, Zend Extension).

Best,

Has anyone else had trouble with libmcrypt tanking the server when its
enabled? I'm running PHP 5 on IIS 6, Win2003, and whenever I enable
libmcrypt, the server won't respond. When I disable it, its back up.

dev-lang/php-5.0.5-r1

I have a developemnt box running several sites.  I'm having difficulty
with one of them.  Some of the GET variables have legit ampersands in
them. I tried escaping them then rescaping them but got unexpected
results.  I changed all the separators in the urls to be &amp;, but
that didn't seem to work for me either.

As per the PHP docs, the W3C recommends arg_separator to be ";" instead
of "&".  Ah, I thought, there is my answer.

I did some poking around and found arg_separator *should* be able to be
set on a per directory basis.  I didn't want to do it site wide because
that would entail changing every site I have on my development box AND
all the production servers upstream.  I just wanted to do it for this
one site (for now) So, I left the default in the php.ini and in the
apache vhost conf <Directory> I added 

php_admin_value arg_separator.input ;

But it does not seem to be picking that up.  I must be missing
something.. any ideas?

Can you elaborate? The urlencode() function should work just fine.

Message-ID: <43A76035.1080804@phpwerx.net>

Ok,

1. proper url encoding

Say you have 2 items to go into the url:

$item1 = 'this & that';
$item2 = 'example at example.org';

Now, in order to get them into a url string, you want to urlencode (or 
rawurlencode) the values, so it will look like:

$urlstring = 'whatever.php?item1='. urlencode($item1) .'&item2='. 
urlencode($item2);

so urlstring now contains:

whatever.php?item1=this+%26+that&item2=example%40example.org

or, if you used rawurlencode:

whatever.php?item1=this%20%26%20that&item2=example%40example.org

This is now fine to enter into the location bar of your browser, but 
that & in the middle will wreak havoc on your html.  One answer is to 
replace it with ; and change the arg_separator, but an easier solution 
is to do that same to it as you would for any other piece of data you're 
going to insert into your html page, run it through htmlentities

echo '<a href="'. htmlentities($urlstring) .'">a link</a>';

will result in:

<a 
href="whatever.php?item1=this+%26+that&amp;item2=example%40example.org">a 
link</a>

As you can see that pesky & is converted to a nice &amp; and your url 
will work 100% plus help you protect against XSS attacks, regardless of 
the arg separator you're using.

Here is a handy little function to take an array and turn it into a 
query string, ready to go into a header or curl call, or through 
htmlentities and into html:

function query_string($vars)
{
     $arg_sep = ini_get('arg_separator.output');
     if (empty($arg_sep)) {
         $arg_sep = '&';
     }

     foreach ($vars as $key => $val) {
         $vars[$key] = urlencode($key) .'='. urlencode($val);
     }

     return implode($arg_sep,$vars);
}

2. If you do want to set the arg_separator.input and/or .output to 
something else, use the php_value (not php_admin_value) and throw the 
directive into the .htaccess file at the root of your php scripts

Do you check for errors in User::create()? Have you checked that DB

What's the meaning of "admin='f'"?

My guess is that $db_res->fields['password'] doesn't contain the 
result of the original crypt() call with random salt.

As of PHP 5, this is a built-in function, http_build_query().

Thanks for the suggestions.  

I went with the above, my problem was elsewhere.  While this is less

It looks like the A&M Roadhouse (http://www.amroadhouse.com/) may be the
best bet.  We're tentative for an informal dinner/drinks, December 27th, at
6:30pm.  We'll be getting an announcement out and an event on the calendar
once confirmed but it looks promising.

Group? That would be Spacemonkey and the Joomaloids. We're hard at
work on our first single, "Scrooged!".

Happy holidays everyone, and enjoy your commute! hehe

The funny thing is that we are the entire team that made the recent
Mambo (the one that won all the awards and so on), so we look at it
more like they forked Mambo, and we just picked a new name. This was
needed so we were empowered to move forward unfettered and unmolested.

I prefer to use the term spork, as it is more like somewhere between a
fork and a spoon. Or maybe we are more like a spatula, but the
holidays make me think we are most like tongs or perhaps a nutmeg
grinder.

If not, make your own. :)

Tim's Fat Free, non-alcoholic, calorie free Holiday Cheer (aka Eggnog)

6 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk - whole, not skim, get with the season!
1/3-1/2 cup sugar (depending on how sweet you like it)
4-8 tablespoons light rum (I use Bacardi Silver)
4-8 tablespoons bourbon (I use Kentucky Tavern, if you can find it.)
2 teaspoons real vanilla (use the real stuff, don't cheap out!)

ICE

1 cup heavy or whipping cream
3 tablespoons sugar



In a large heavy saucepan, combine the first 3 ingredients. Cook
over a medium heat until the mixture starts to coat a metal spoon.
This means it's turning into a light custard. Stir constantly to avoid
sticking and the resultant clumps.

Remove from heat. Cool quickly by placing the whole pot into an icewater
bath, stirring for 2-3 minutes. You want lots of ice, as this will melt
it fast.

Stir in the rum, bourbon and vanilla.

Chill 4-24 hrs. KEEP YOUR FINGERS OUT!

Before serving, whip cream and remaining sugar until it just forms
soft peaks. Not too stiff, you don't want whipcream lumps!

In a serving bowl, pour the well chilled egg mixture, fold in the
whipped cream, keeping it light and fluffy.

Serve within a short time, as the whipped cream startd to lose it's loft.
Sprinkle with a little nutmeg.

Makes about 10 4oz servings, 5 8oz servings, 2 really nice servings, or, 
what the heck, drink it all yourself as a quality control test, and make another
batch.

Note:
You can adjust the amount of booze (only up, of course) before you
fold in the whipped cream. It doesn't combine well afterward.

Happy Holidays!

Message-ID: <d0cb92620512212116m56dc1cefj931ae5ba69a41b4f@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Gals and Guys,

I have noticed that there are alot of freelancers on the list and I am
looking for a little advice.  I have a client that is being a pain.  I
spent alot of time developing a site for them and it turned out very
nice in my opinion.  The client seemed very happy with the finished
product as well.

The client paid about 1/3 of the cost of the site up front and was
supposed to pay the balance on delivery.  I delivered the site months
ago and have not received further payment.  The site is still active
and it has been receiving alot of traffic.  They receive hundreds of
visits a day and many users submitting information.  Needless to say
they are doing business with the site and making a profit from it.

The owner of the site has not returned my many calls and emails over
the past two months.  I am trying to figure out how to get him to
acknowledge me and hopefully pay up!  I have a full time job as a
Java/PHP/.NET programmer so I don't do freelance often. This was the
only project I have done in years and it was as a favor to a friend. 
Now I regret doing it at all and feel that I was taken advantage of.

Any advice?

Actually a customer is somebody who pays for things, so this is not a
customer, they are somebody you allowed to steal from you.  Here is how
you prevent this in the future.

Never deliver a system without payment in full, and you get progress
payments as you go.  this means you need a W-I-P server where you can put
the drafts for them to see, but which they cannot get.  If they run into
cash problems and want to slow down  you say "great", and just leave it
there until they come back.  If they want to hurry up you say, "great" and
ask for some more progress money.

If they protest that they don't want to pay too much up front, there are
two things you must do so that each of you is minimizing risk:

1)  State very clearly something like this "My ability to extend credit is
very limited, I cannot do more than $X of work w/o being paid, otherwise I
cannot keep my commitments"

2)  Make sure to give frequent updates to the WIP site so they can see
what they are paying for, this lets them protest and stop progress
payments if they don't like it.

For the current situation, they obviously believe that they don't have to
pay you, that you don't count.  Have your family attorney send them a
letter demanding payment.  If that does not work your attorney can
escalate, and you can probably send their hosting company a letter saying
they are hosting an illegal site and ask them to take it down.   HOWEVER,
it is very important when  you pursue this legal stuff to know that it
will take about 30-60 minutes every 2-4 weeks, and in the meantime you
must not think about these guys, they'll poison your mind, concentrate
instead on new jobs and getting paid for those.  When this money comes in
after 3-6 months it will be like a bonus.

On the flip side, I occasionally would like to outsource "pieces" but am
always nervous unless I have a REALLY concrete spec. And most often, by
the time I have written a spec to the level of detail required, I've
written the code. It would be wonderful to be able to hand over a
"fuzzy" spec. and allow the contractor to develop open-ended based on it
and an interactive process. Is there any way to do this without getting
royally screwed other than trust and faith?

Thomas,

I work with a designer that uses a collection agency that charges no fee's
unless they recover.  I can find out the name of the company, they are on
the west coast.  As a freelancer you should never release the code until
payment is made in full.  Put the site on your web host or dev machine for
them to test.  They pay and then you move it over.  I will see what i can do
to get the collection agency's contact information.

Thanks,

This is a great thread.  Kudos to all involved.  I would suggest there's
still a lot of caveat emptor... even in open source ;-)  I think the fuzzy
spec that Cliff is referencing is doable under the mantra, "release early,
release often".  Be it coding or fleshing out the spec no one should get too
far down the path without feedback (and compensation).  Obviously, such
feedback requires documentation (UML?) to ensure the fuzz doesn't get
out-of-hand.

Kenneth's advice reminds me of the brick mason story.  After getting screwed
by contractors/home owners many times (e.g. building a fireplace and not
getting paid), the crafty mason would place a sheet of glass about halfway
up the flue during construction.  The client would visit everyday to ensure
the chimney/fireplace looked the way they wanted.  Upon completion the mason
would leave the invoice and wait....  When the client complained that the
house filled with smoke, the mason would complain that he hadn't been paid.
Everything was to spec, the home owner could even look straight up the
chimney and see blue sky, so why hasn't he been paid?  Upon receipt of the
check, the mason would simply climb back up on the roof and drop a brick
down the flu, bid the homeowner a nice day and then kill his dog;-)

The moral of the story?  Always be sure you have a brick in your back
pocket.

Cheers,

Cliff,

I've given a great of thought to this, and believe the answer is
technology.  I thought we needed a tool that made possible very rapid
spec-code-review cycles, lots of iterative development, development by
successive approximations.  So I wrote it.  It is called Andromeda.  I use
it myself for my clients, and you can take download it here:

http://dhost2.secdat.com

My statement of work is usually a page or two, based upon pre-sale
discussions.  We outline all of the major tables and custom screens, but
leave the details for after the first check.  My cost estimates are based
on major table count and rules-of-thumb for adding in ancillary tables. 
So far it is working out great.  I can do many small changes of spec with
no recoding and no price changes, and I also have clear guidelines that
customers accept for spec changes that require more $.

This is a pre-alpha, purely for anybody who has interest in jumping in
VERY early, before even all of the naming conventions and stuff like that
are settled.  If you need something more production-ready, probably best
to wait.

The current release is GPL, but it will be dual-licensed, something like
mySQL.  The free version will always be bleeding edge, the commercial
version will be stable and supported by my company, Secure Data Software.

Sue him.  Depending on the amount, you may be able to do it in small 
claims court, where the process is extremely cheap, easy and does not 
require retaining professional counsel.

Last I checked, the amount was $4k and under -- otherwise, you have to take
full legal action.

This isn't legal advice, but I would say some options would be to:

a)  send a legal letter stating something to the effect that you own your
work until it has been fully purchased (giving you rights to take it down),

b)  remit them to a collection agency -- no one wants bad credit or
harassment,

c)  take them to court.

The truth is, a client can still refuse to pay after a court has ordered the
client to do so -- there's little recourse if they continue to flat-out
refuse to pay, just more bureaucracy -- so the most you can do is apply as
much legal, financial and professional pressure within the law until they
break and pay you.

(Even if they don't, it's better that you pursue them as much as you can;
it sets a precedent in a karmic sort of way -- the next client will be less
likely to stiff you, and you'll have better experience setting up rules in
advance, which also make you more valuable.)

Another extremely effective collection techniquie:  Show-up.

If the client is local and ducking your calls an emails, they obviously
don't like confrontation.  Showing up might result in a check.

Do you have any ability to take the site down?  You should have language in
your agreement that say the site belongs to you until the final payment is
made.  Especially if the site is making money for your "client" he'd be very
anxious to pay up if the site were taken down.

Hey Gals and Guys,

I have noticed that there are alot of freelancers on the list and I am
looking for a little advice.  I have a client that is being a pain.  I
spent alot of time developing a site for them and it turned out very
nice in my opinion.  The client seemed very happy with the finished
product as well.

The client paid about 1/3 of the cost of the site up front and was
supposed to pay the balance on delivery.  I delivered the site months
ago and have not received further payment.  The site is still active
and it has been receiving alot of traffic.  They receive hundreds of
visits a day and many users submitting information.  Needless to say
they are doing business with the site and making a profit from it.

The owner of the site has not returned my many calls and emails over
the past two months.  I am trying to figure out how to get him to
acknowledge me and hopefully pay up!  I have a full time job as a
Java/PHP/.NET programmer so I don't do freelance often. This was the
only project I have done in years and it was as a favor to a friend.
Now I regret doing it at all and feel that I was taken advantage of.

Any advice?

you have to be careful if your contract doesnt say the site is yours until
payment is made and you take it down, he can get you for defacing his site

Joesph is right.  That is something to look for.  It also underlines the
fact that contracts should be both strong and enforceable.  Its well worth
the dough to have an attorney draw one up that is suited to your specific
business and types of clients you deal with.

Just wanted to jump in here about something Mark said in the message quoted
below: If you have the ability to take the site down and are thinking about
doing so I would definitely talk to an attorney before you do anything like
that.

A few months ago, I got stiffed on a $3200 contract and I was seriously
considering doing the exact same thing. I found out though that, unless your
contract has very specific language that allows you to do so, taking the
site down can result in you being successfully sued. Especially if they are
making money on it.

Talk to an attorney before you do anything so drastic. It sucks not getting
paid but being sued sucks more.

Kenneth's advice is very sound and level headed.

I suggest always working under a written and signed agreement that
details:
    - scope of work (spec based, time based, etc.)
    - milestones
    - deliverables (both from you and from the client)
    - timeline (maybe rough)
    - rates (hourly, daily, etc.) & expenses (licensing, etc.) and how
      they're handled (pre-approved budget, approved on-demand, etc)
    - payment schedule (on milestones, once a month, etc.)
    - late (such as 5% penalty per month) & cancellation fees (they want
      to back out)
    - who owns the code and how/when ownership will be transferred
      (copyright transfer) or license to use will be granted
Sign it yourself and get them to sign it.

But this just helps you support your case if it should happen again.
I'd pursue Kenneth's suggestion of a lawyer, or small claims court.

HTH,
Andrew

I'd suggest taking a look at the book

Graphic Artists Guild Handbook: Pricing & Ethical Guidelines

it has quite a bit of lawyer-written gobbledygook you can use as
boilerplates for your own agreements. While it has a graphics
perspective, the basic prinicples can be applied to any freelance work
for hire.

Same case.  Same dollar amount.  Same client?  hmmm...

Yes, I have customer who has done the same thing.  Unless your contract 
explicitly says something like "If you don't pay within N days, I take 
back my property" you'll regret even considering it.  Potential damages, 
unauthorized access to systems, etc... just don't do it.  Of course, if 
you can get an injunction preventing them from using it...

My client makes an average of $10k/transaction and 8-10 
transactions/month.  And he's getting pissy over this tiny amount.  Face 
it, some people are just punks.  While you'd like to hurt their dog, you 
need to be bigger than that and learn from the experience.

Just be sure to *never* sign a confidentiality agreement about the 
experience.  You never know when you can save someone else a hassle...

Any advice?

Well no legal advice -- that's for sure.

A couple of thoughts which may be helpful:

You could check with your local Small Business Administration office --
they often can give you some good ideas on how to deal with problems 
like this which are commonly faced by small businesses.

Maybe sending them a certified letter with return receipt requested
would be a good idea. I think it should have a pleasant tone --
perhaps suggesting that the client has been too busy and overlooked
payment of the invoice.

But, at least, don't put anything in it which could be (mis)construed as
threatening or harassing. I would most definitely not put a threat to
sue them in writing. (Again, this is only what I would do -- not
legal advice).

With all due respect Tim---

How come when this comes up many of us find it appropriate to be pleasant
and polite.  Frankly, when a client doesn't pay for work, and arrogantly
refuses to even acknowledge the debt, he is (in some states) committing a
crime-- theft of service.

The behavior is immoral, unethical and downright rotten.  I think the
appropriate  way to react-- within the bounds of ethics and the law-- is to
aggressively pursue what is due to you.  Why do credit card companies,
banks, etc., have such aggressive collection practices?  Because they work.

My $.02.

Java/PHP/.NET programmer so I don't do freelance often. This was the
only project I have done in years and it was as a favor to a friend.
Now I regret doing it at all and feel that I was taken advantage of.

Any advice?

Well no legal advice -- that's for sure.

A couple of thoughts which may be helpful:

You could check with your local Small Business Administration office --
they often can give you some good ideas on how to deal with problems
like this which are commonly faced by small businesses.

Maybe sending them a certified letter with return receipt requested
would be a good idea. I think it should have a pleasant tone --
perhaps suggesting that the client has been too busy and overlooked
payment of the invoice.

But, at least, don't put anything in it which could be (mis)construed as
threatening or harassing. I would most definitely not put a threat to
sue them in writing. (Again, this is only what I would do -- not
legal advice).

Having done a lot of this type of work, typically even if the spec is 
detailed, there are plenty of other little details that you're leaving 
out, so there's still value in sending it out.

It's always an interactive process, unless your specs are written in 
stone by the finger of Dog and handed down from atop a smoke-covered 
desert mountain. (In fact, the idea of iterative specs is the 
cornerstone of all those "agile" software development dogmata.)

> royally screwed other than trust and faith?

If the guy is "good", trust and faith is enough and the contract is 
superfluous. He does the work, and you pay him.

If the guy is "bad", trust and faith *and* a contract won't be enough in 
any case.

Much of the contracting world is based on trust; you live and die by it. 
I've recently been an observer to a dispute between a contractor and his 
client; the contractor simply failed to deliver repeatedly.
I will decline to make further commentary other than to say that I was 
neither the client nor the contractor.

But it sounds like a sincere effort was already made. The client could
have even said, "your work sucked so bad it's not worth the paper I wipe
my ass with." But the client didn't. Of course, all the serious legal
suggestions are appropriate; however, if it were a different era and I

Yes.  I also read once that FedEx is more likely to be opened than certified

I have experienced this in the past, and have been working as a 
contractor for 10+ years.  In one case, I had a very large client who 
refused to pay money on a job even after something was delivered in 
full.  The president of the company wanted, at that point, some 
changes made to the project (for free) which would have effectively 
meant ripping it apart and reworking not only programming, but also 
design.

And this was on a site that had already been very well received by the public.

I was young and impetuous and I just ripped down the content 
management tools after getting in a heated, expletive-riddled 
argument with him, figuring that it wasn't impacting the customer's 
view of everything, only the client's ability to keep his information 
current.

Needless to say, this got some results, but it also almost got my 
team in a lot of trouble (i.e., sued).  Since this was a large 
client, they actually hired a consultant to come in and mediate the 
dispute and figure out what went wrong.  By that time, I was not 
willing to continue work on the job, so we ended up parting ways, and 
we got paid some (but not all) of what we were owed.  So my strategy 
got me something, but not everything.  Is there a way that could have 
gotten me everything?  Probably, yes.

I think now that I am older...it would take me longer before I 
declared war on a client.  I don't know what the status of the 
original poster's project and relationship are, but it may not yet be 
time to get to that point, and until you get to that point, you 
should always be pleasant and polite.  (Actually, I'd argue that 
pleasant and polite is even a good policy AFTER you're at the point 
of contemplating lawsuits and dog killing.)

I've also been on the other end, by the way. I've had contractors 
that I hired not deliver me things, and even just disappear -- 
without even responding to emails.  This is exacerbating, but it 
happens...they don't have something done, they vastly underestimated 
effort, they think they can't do it or maybe they got a better gig, 
so rather than have that discussion with me, they just avoid the 
conflict and ignore me.

Whether you are the consultant or the client, then, I think the same 
rules apply.

Think this way: the only way to get someone to give you what you want 
is to make them want to give it to you.

So I would exhaust every 'nice' avenue there was in an effort to get 
the money before I went postal, because once you getting nasty is a 
bridge that collapses after you cross it, and it's extremely 
difficult to ever get back to the 'nice' side of the river once 
you're on the other side.

But, if those attempts all fail...invoking a collection agency or 
lawyer might be the only way, and I guess the decision to do that 
depends on how much money it is and how important that sum is to you.

Cheers,

Years ago the company I worked for dealt with this very situation.  The 
1st time it happened, they disabled the application but provided 
information to the company as to how to access their data.  They sued, 
and the cost of defense was too much.  My company settled out of court 
by re-activating the system and of all things paying like 5k.  They 
never collected, and with the settlement, ended up costing themselves to 
develop the app!

 From that point on they had much more explicit language in their 
contracts, but never had to deactivate an application again.  This was 
due to a more creative solution.  Errors.  Simply introduce code which 
once a set date is hit, cause the application to throw an error in a key 
area of the application.  When the customer calls to have it fixed, you 
say not until I receive payment for the app development, and advance 
payment for the estimated time to correct the "error".  Actual error 
correction was to remove this payment trap.

There's something about people stiffing you that triggers a certain
variety of rage that is truly unique, in my experience. I have never been
big on macho aggression, but this sort of thing makes me very nearly
understand why a person could want to hurt somebody. A homo sapiens, that
is, not an innocent dog.

This is probably just semantics, but I think this is risky.

It's one thing to have an "auto-expiration" but it's totally different 
about leaving critical "errors" in the system, let alone adding them.

I will go with the auto-expiration from here on out though.  ;)

In a PHP environment where your code is exposed,  your probably right on 
the risk.  The error is not truely an error, but an error of your own 
made to look convincing.  I've effectively used this method since I have 
free lanced, but not in a PHP environment.  The largest part of the risk 
as I see it is the discovery that the error was intentional.  Without 
access to the code, this risk is quite low.  With access to the code, 
the risk is as high as the technical skills of your client, or their 
willingness to pay to have a technical person review your code.

The timeout idea would only be useful if it is written into the 
contract, and is sufficiently spread throughout the code and based on 
encrypted/obfuscated data.  Otherwise it's a cake walk to remove from 
the code.

Howdy:

As others have mentioned, small claims court, as long as your claim is 
small enough, is piece of cake.  Otherwise, you'll need a real lawyer.  
Enforcement of unpaid judgements is done via marshalls and/or sherrifs 
depending on the jurisdiction.  If you're in the NY area, I can recommend 
a good attorney.

Yeah. You got three different ways to solve your problem, and both
include additional effort which I write off as "deadbeat protection":

1) Require final payment *before* delivery of the final deliverable. I
put our code projects on a development server that the client can
access and test from the front-side, so they know that the code
actually works and does what it is supposed to. No payment? No code.
This one is the simplest one.
2) Require a purchase order before starting the project. That should
provide just enough commitment from the client that they are now
legally liable if they fail to pay after the terms of that purchase
order are met.
3) Take 40% up front, 40% as sign off (that means they sign a document
accepting that you are complete and the software does what it is
supposed to), and then the final 20% when it is running on their
servers. This minimizes your exposure, but you can still get stiffed.

Ultimately, you have a soft good, and the second it is out of your
hands it should be considered gone forever. IMHO being pleasant and
polite are absolutely not a requirement when someone is ripping you
off. But regardless of your manners, you need to take steps to ensure
you have a way to protect yourself from those that take your
generosity and helpful nature for granted, and then take your product
without paying in full.

Kenneth's advice is very sound and level headed.

I suggest always working under a written and signed agreement that
details:
    - scope of work (spec based, time based, etc.)
    - milestones
    - deliverables (both from you and from the client)
    - timeline (maybe rough)
    - rates (hourly, daily, etc.) & expenses (licensing, etc.) and how
      they're handled (pre-approved budget, approved on-demand, etc)
    - payment schedule (on milestones, once a month, etc.)
    - late (such as 5% penalty per month) & cancellation fees (they want
      to back out)
    - who owns the code and how/when ownership will be transferred
      (copyright transfer) or license to use will be granted
Sign it yourself and get them to sign it.

But this just helps you support your case if it should happen again.
I'd pursue Kenneth's suggestion of a lawyer, or small claims court.

HTH,
Andrew

Either way you want to validate the debt.
That is, you want to make sure the client knows
how much he owes and for what, and give him 30 days
to dispute it.

If the client is real weasel, he might claim that
he never got an invoice -- and then after you invoice
him (again) start disputing the fee(s) charged.

It is much easier to get a legal ruling in your
favor, if you have a valid debt to begin with --
or at least that is my understanding.

(Of course, since I am not a lawyer, my understanding
of this sort of thing should be taken with a 'grain of salt')

Sorry but this is a terrible idea. Not only is it probably fraudulent, 
but it gives the world valid excuses for not paying you (errors). It 
also validates your (bad) reputation, which otherwise may have remained 
at the rumor / disgruntled cheapskate stage. IMHO never, ever compromise 
your integrity like this.

Mitch offered excellent advice above IMHO, as did Kenneth Downs with his 
work-in-progress process.I agree in theory with Andrew's suggestions 
about specs but I also know that a really detailed spec is a wonderful 
vehicle for screwing people out of their wages. Lawyers get paid to 
argue so the more detail subject to interpreattion the higher the cheat 
ceiling.

The whole issue for me is one of professionalism both in work and 
business relationship. Stay the course, hold the line, etc. all apply 
here. Sure it might hurt now but it's nothing personal, IT'S JUST 
BUSINESS. Whether you want to believe it or not, a whole of the business 
world is about cheating other players out of their earned share.

So, a bunch of IF's seem to apply here. Just like "if you didn't make a 
backup before your host went bankrupt, it's not the host's fault" we can 
say:
- if you never had a plan to deal with non-payers, you haven't prepared 
your business properly.
- if you had too many eggs in one basket, you weren't properly financed
- if you're overheated emotionally by the gall of the guy, you haven't 
the temperament for business

And perhaps most poignantly, if you don't know what to do to "influence" 
this guy to pay you the agreed fee, GAME OVER. You lose.

Probably sounds too harsh but it is true - if he can "get away with it" 
while working within the "system", then you lost and need to learn from 
it. And that includes his being legally wrong and you legally correct, 
yet insufficiently funded to pursue him successfully. Many, many 
business people play those odds every day. If you keep losing you are 
not doing yourself any favors staying in business (and you ARE helping 
the bottom line of that portion of the marketplace that is comprised of 
bottom-feeding scum and scammers).

It's really not as negative as it may sound... just realistic. I am 100% 
sure that some creative problem solving could help you, IF you were 
properly prepared to "stay the course". I once had a client $XX,000 
behind, making money with my work and ignoring my bills. It went to 
almost  $XXX,000 before I collected. The reason I was able to collect in 
full was because except for recurring "past due" notices and the like 
(including usurious 21% interest penalties I added unsuccessfully), I 
didn't start a war. Instead I sought ways to leverage that $40k value he 
was enjoying against the additional debt he would subsequently incur 
with further development. Ater all, if he was making cash off my work 
and didn't have to pay me (perhaps thinking he could shut me out at any 
moment) he was a sucker for more. By the time we got close to 6 figures 
it was very clear that he had a larger than six figure liability 
(equivalent to the value of the system) if I was not satisfied. One day 
I required payment in full with no compromise and it was a simple 
business decision for him to pay me promptly, as it was for me to 
subsequently exit from any further involvement. Perhaps someone on this 
list knows the client. I consider him a good reference, and a 
poor-quality client.

As for small claims, I live by the truth that *nothing* costs less than 
$5k, regardless of price. Even if the market says $2k it's not true... 
everything costs more than $5k to manage should things go even slightly 
wrong. Don't take any job that doesn't generate at least $5k in profits 
or you are assuming risk in the market place simply because there are so 
many bottom-feeders out there scamming in the under $5k market where the 
costs of doing business exceed the value. It's a game and you should 
only play it if you are willing to assume the risk or have another 
"angle" (like a brother who's a really aggressive lawyer :-)  Of course 
being willing to take the risk as a startup counts as a valid reason to 
take on the work, but then you can't really complain when you get 
cheated because you took the risk, right? There are plenty of forums for 
complaing that some people in this world suck.

Thank you everyone for the excellent responses. I think I will just
cut my losses.

I will continue to contact the client to attempt to collect the debt
but I will definitely not bother discontinuing service. Sounds like it
could turn out to be more of a headache then it's worth.  I did use a
ioncube's encoder on the php files so if the client wants any changes
outside of the things they can do with the custom CMS or changing the
smarty templates they will have to come to me.

I guess the lesson learned is to ask for periodic payments. And to not
deliver the final product with out payment.

I really appreciate all the advice.  Once again this list has proved
to be very, very valuable.

Thank you!

TOM

This is untrue.  There is a great deal of good work in the small project
sector, but it takes experience to pick out the ones that will be 'good
clients'.  I've had my issues with horrible clients (one's that still send
threatening email and voice mails to this day), and I generally chalked it
up to experience.  In that past year alone, I've had at least 20 sub-$5k.
They were quick, easy, paid on time or even (gasp!) early - as in 100% up
front.

I'm a big fan of being careful, drawing up a solid contract, keeping a
lawyer on retainer, etc.  But the idea that anyone with a project under $5k
is a swindler is a horrible way to look at our business and is
self-perpetuating.  After 7 years in the business, I can honestly say that
some of my BEST clients could never afford someone with a 5 figure minimum.
And they come early and often.  Also, don't be mistaken, my hourly wage is
correctly expensive, as in, high enough to scare away those looking for an
intricate site for $500 and low enough for a serious client/professional to
afford.

What becomes largely important when fending for yourself (freelance) is that
you know how to pick a client.  Just like a big-budget company would be
smart to give you a small BS gig to test you, you should consider the same.
You do a small part of a larger project, and pay close attention to the
interaction.  How early and completely did they pay?  What changes were they
adamant about?  How well did they understand your timing, pricing and
process?  How did they feel about your paperwork (contracts, specs, etc)?
Did they treat you as a professional or a hack?  Did they call you at 3am to
complain about pixels?

I've known incredibly successful managers who wouldn't hire someone until
they've had a solid night of drinking between them.  This is a similar
idea.  Getting to know someone before introducing them to your wife.

In business we tend to forget that we're dealing with people.  The swine out
there make this plenty easy.  I'm proud to say that of all my clients (about
15 regular clients, internationally) have no need for contracts regardless
of the size of the project.  Sure, projects that make it to the high 5/6
figure level include contracts, but that's mutual protection for all parties
involved (including the likely investors). Otherwise, I send invoices so
they can report for tax time, and I write proposals for their clients, but
my relationship with MY clients are solid.  We've chosen each other as we
would choose a friend.  Reliable and honest.  This, to me, is the ideal way
to do business, and better yet, to live (which freelancing tends to cross
borders with regularly).

Hmm.. after reading your post I think perhaps we are miscommunicating. 
It sounds like those "quick, easy, paid on time" projets of yours are 
exactly the kind I call "$5k projects". Had they not been as quick as 
anticipated, or paid on time, they would have caused hassle you would 
have had to reconsider due to the cost of pursuit.  Lucky you there were 
no issues. Or perhaps it was not luck:

How careful can one be and especially with contracts, for a deal that 
earns less than $5k? Not with my lawyers nor with my hourly. That was 
partly my point. Of course it is my *personal* ruleof thumb about the 
$5k mark... it might be different for different situations.

Ummm... I didn't intend to imply that. However I do believe there are 
*many* business people in that market who  I would  suggest  have a 
business model that monetizes the channel at least as much as the 
customer. That means they seek to make money off the various players and 
not just the client. Sometimes they only win work via low bid, and 
monetize the channel via methods such as those described.

This also belies the truth. They come often implies they are repeats. 
Repeats are valuable - everyone agrees. They have a relatively low 
overhead as clients. So doesn't that mean it is worthwhile to take on 
some risk with the first project, because you are banking on repeat 
(lower overhead) business? That was exactly my point prior.. and a 
decent approach imho. However, that initial sub-$5k project, on my 
books, is a break even or a loss leader.

Perhaps I was to colorful in my descriptions, but I feel we don't disagree.

Here, here.  I live by this same rule, and although it's not easy and not an
easy way to multimillion euros of business, assures me that when I do
something I really get paid.

I can't seem to find this from RTFM. How indeed do you go about upgrading
a slave server from 4.1.x to 5.0.17 and not break replication in the

This should be no problem at all - you just shut down the slave,
upgrade it, and replication should pick up again when you
restart. Then you can upgrade the master. This is the same as it was
with 3.x to 4.x.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-upgrade-5-0.html

Generally, you want your slaves to be the same version as the master,
but if that's not possible (as in when you upgrade), then the slaves
must be higher version than the master.

Hello,

I am creating an order form in HTML on a Linux machine. I would like to
fetch all or some of the fields from that form and put them in an email and
send the email to anyone. How can I do that? Is there an email feature in
PHP? If there is such a feature, then is it supported by all the versions of
PHP and where can I find some examples of this?

Thanks.
Sincerely Yours,
Salman.

There is the mail() function in PHP
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php>

This is a simple script to mail the contents of your form back to 
yourself would
be:

<?php
   $to = 'youremail at your.domain.com';
   $subject = 'Order form contents';
   $headers = 'From: orderform at your.domain.com';
   $body = print_r($_POST,true); // assumes that you are using the POST method
   mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers);
?>

I have no error checking in the script and I haven't checked it for syntax
errors.

There is probably no easier, more defined way than learning PEAR's Mail

http://pear.php.net/packages.php?catpid=14&catname=Mail
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.mail.mail.php

While it supports PHP native mail() call it's probably better to  
learn the package anyway.

shell> sudo pear install --alldeps Mail

Then I wonder what I did wrong when I upgraded a slave yesterday. The M in
RTFM recommends mysqldumping all your data pre-upgrade and re-storing it
post-upgrade. I did that. When I ran 'show slave status' it was broken.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Opinions Wanted: Data Management App
Message-ID: <43B2EB41.2010000@polymerdb.org>

Hi All,

I have an Open Source PHP/MySQL project I've been doing solo for quite a 
while, and I need some opinions on the value of continuing it.  Any 
comments you can make on the following situation are greatly 
appreciated.  I explain the situation first, and then some details on 
the project.

Some time ago (two or three years by now) I was looking for a package 
that would let me move my existing MS-Access database to an online 
system, preferably using PHP and MySQL.  I didn't find anything 
existing, so I started making my own.  (It was around that time that I 
subscribed to NYPHP-Talk.)

For a long time I've thought of this as an Open Source project, even 
gave it a name and got a spot on Sourceforge a few months ago, started a 
blog and a wiki to organize and publicize my thoughts on it, and spent a 
good deal of energy trying to separate the generic reusable parts from 
the "my database app" parts. So now I actually have a project that is 
self-contained and could be used to create Web-based database apps 
similar to what you might create with MS-Access.

I personally think it's pretty neat, and I keep using it because I like 
it and I couldn't find anything better.  But the effort of using it 
myself is significantly less than what it takes to make sure it's 
acceptable as a public project.  And recently I've started to think that 
maybe the PHP communitye doesn't need a package like this.  So I have to 
assess whether to keep investing in the public angle or just go back to 
doing it for myself.  I'd like you're opinion.

Here's what the thing does:
As I mentioned above, this was originally meant to be a PHP/MySQL 
replacement for MS-Access.  It mostly keeps the same  concepts of forms 
and reports (using Smarty templates), queries, and modules, so it gives 
a pretty nicely structured environment for creating an application.  
It's not meant for typical online publishing applications like blogging 
or similar jobs that could be handled well by most CMS packages, but 
primarily for data input and retrieval systems, like databases for 
membership, personnel, inventory, etc.  One of the best features, I 
think, is the ability to control access to different sections of your 
app based on the user's membership in different permission groups.  With 
this package, I can get a database app running pretty quickly, by 
creating a few tables and a few templates, then assigning the 
navigational links ("actions") to different permission groups, and 
setting up whatever users there are.

Pros and Cons:
There are a few things I really like about this package, and some things 
I think are going to limit it.  To keep this email less long, I'll link 
to the list here: http://polymerdb.org/wiki/doku.php?id=pros_and_cons

My Questions:
1. Is there something already out there that's better?
2. Is this kind of project even interesting to the PHP community?
3. If it's worth continuing, I'll take any recommendations on best ways 
to move it forward.

Other links:

Thanks for your time and input.

Define "broken".

What does show slave status show?

Allen, I'll give it a go.

We have to first ask the question, what is its value to you?  Do you use
it to make a living, or for a hobby project, or for just the fun?

It sounds like you are asking other people whether to continue, but that
would only be a valid course of action if it has no value to you.  If it
has value to you then of course you continue on those grounds.  That
leaves as a separate question whether it has value to anybody else.

I think I can relate.  I've got my own open source db system, which I now
shamelessly plug here:

http://dhost2.secdat.com

but what you are not saying, though it seems to scream out from the post,
is that there is not much interest in it.  Am I correct?  Is the question
really, should I maintain this public project that nobody(for appropriate
values of 'nobody') is using?


>

But do you think its insanely great?  Open Source is just like commercial
stuff in that people go with the projects whose creators believe their
projects are amazing and wonderful.

> But the effort of using it

A businessman's answer is to devote resources to the public project in
proportion to the expected payback.  If you are doing it for fun and glory
it is time vs. glory.  If you are hoping to attract programmers to it and
expand your company's credibility, gain colleagues you can hire or be
hired by, then you have to weigh the value of these benefits against your
time in promoting it.  What kind of track record can you look back on to
inform the answers to these questions?

> And recently I've started to think that

When you say "...maybe the PHP community..." I'm again guessing that you
are not seeing the interest you hope.  Do you talk it up at user's
meetings?  Do you mention it to colleagues at every opportunity?  Do you
believe it can change a person's life for the better (I don't mean
blinding light religious experience, I mean getting home an hour earlier
to see kids, swim in pool, etc.) and do you tell people so?  How do they
respond?

Key question: Is anybody using it besides you.  If not, why not?  What do
people tell you?

Since I have also written a database-centric PHP framework, I'd be happy
to ruthlessly challenge all of your assumptions and you could do the same
to mine.  Would such an exchange benefit anybody?  Would they learn from
the approaches you've taken?  Does it benefit anybody to know your
approach even if they don't use your system?

Hope this helps.  Its no easy thing to write a framework, and no small
matter to leave one behind.  I've written 4 and left behind 3 (Fox Dos,
Fox Windows, VFP Windows all abandoned for PHP Linux), and was lead
architect on one written by somebody else, its easy to become *very*
attached to them, and its always healthy to ask, "Is this what I should be
doing?"

Oops, sorry, too late. I restored replication yesterday and don't
remember.  Other than "seconds behind master" was NULL and some other
value up at the top of the output was other than "waiting for master to
send event," and I did a couple informal tests -- change some data on
master, see if update propagates to slave -- and they failed.

The lack of interest thus far is not so much of a concern or surprise 
for me. I should have mentioned that in fact I have done essentially no 
promotion of this project. It's therefore natural and expected that I 
don't have other people using it.  I release the code under an OS 
license as a matter of principle, but I have not invested much time or 
effort in talking it up.

More of an issue for me in this thread is whether such a project would 
actually be useful for other people.  Are people -- the people on this 
list -- looking for an Open Source PHP package that provides a 
structured development environment for data management applications?

Your comments, and your web site, are quite thought-provoking for me in 
this case.  I hope to hear more from others, as well.

Thanks,
Allen

Okay, well, troubleshooting replication is usually pretty
easy. There's not much to it. The master generates binlog files when
queries are run, and the slave pulls these over and runs them.

If there's a problem, it's almost certainly one of the following:

1) The slave is trying to log in to the master with a login that
   either doesn't exist, has the wrong password (or hash scheme), or
   has insufficient permissions.

2) There's some network problem that keeps the slave from seeing the
   master, or the ip address/port of the master is wrong.

3) The binlog files aren't being read, written, or run properly.

4) The binglog files can't be run because the slave state is out of
   sync with the state of the master when then binlog files were
   generated or the slave is using the wrong binlog file/position.

That's basically it, and it's usually relatively easy to narrow down
where the problem is.

Maybe I did something silly and broke it myself. It took some doing
to get it working again for reasons that are also obscure. Anyway, thanks.

Well before I duck out and listen to what others have to contribute, I'll
reiteratie one point, which is that I suspect you will find out more of
its usefulness if you go for more direct promotion.  When you say to
somebody, "I think I have something that may be of use to you" and show it
to them, you find out quick whether or not you are right.  The more of it
you do, the more you find out.

Hey everyone.

I have a client who has a comma delimited file each line being a new record.
currently i am trying to import this data into their new system.  The file
is 40mb in size and contains 650,000 records.

I am using file() and i am sure this is not the best method as the import
process is going dead slow.  What i am doing is this


<?php
ini_set('max_execution_time', 99200);
$link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'root', '8rittany');
$db = mysql_select_db('12all_db');
$lines = file('import.txt');
$count = 0;
$skipped = 0;
foreach ($lines as $l) {
    $line = explode(',', $l);
    if($line[0] == 'Email') continue;
    $sql = "SELECT id FROM 12all_listmembers WHERE
email='".trim($line[0])."'";
    $res = mysql_query($sql);
    if(mysql_num_rows($res) == 0) {
        $count++;
        $dt = explode(' ', $line[4]);
        $sql = "INSERT INTO 12all_listmembers (sdate, email, name, nl,
stime) VALUES('".trim(addslashes($dt[0]))."',
'".trim(addslashes($line[0]))."', '".trim(addslashes($line[1]))."
".trim(addslashes($line[2]))."', 2, '".trim(addslashes($dt[1]))."')";
        $res = mysql_query($sql) or die(mysql_error());
        $id = mysql_insert_id($link);
        $query[] = "INSERT INTO 12all_fieldsd (fid, eid, val, nl) VALUES(1,
".$id.", '".trim(addslashes($line[3]))."', 2)";
        $query[] = "INSERT INTO 12all_fieldsd (fid, eid, val, nl) VALUES(2,
".$id.", '".trim(addslashes($line[4]))."', 2)";
        $query[] = "INSERT INTO 12all_fieldsd (fid, eid, val, nl) VALUES(3,
".$id.", '".trim(addslashes($line[1]))."', 2)";
        $query[] = "INSERT INTO 12all_fieldsd (fid, eid, val, nl) VALUES(4,
".$id.", '".trim(addslashes($line[2]))."', 2)";
        foreach($query as $q) {
            $res = mysql_query($q) or die(mysql_error());
        }
    } else $skipped++;
}
echo 'imported '.$count.' records and skipped '.$skipped.' duplicates.';
?>

Any suggestions on how to speed things up?

Why use php?  Just use mysql to import the file.

I would import the file into a temporary table, then run a query to 
separate and insert data into the appropriate tables/fields afterwards. 
MySQL is pretty fast at doing that stuff.

three things.

First, As a general rule, never post code with the password, even if it is
a throwaway.

Second, if the suggestions to directly import w/mysql work out, that is
probably the best.

Third, if you cannot import w/mySQL tools, a better processing routine
would look like this:

$F=fopen("filename","r");
$kount=0;
while (!feof($F)) {
  $kount++;
  if ($kount % 100 == 0) {
     echo "On line $kount \n";
  }

  $line=fgets(F);  // beware! contains trailing newline char
  ... all processing here ...

}
fclose($F);

You should change this password, even if you only allow local 
connections. You might also want to check to see if you use a similar 
password or naming convention in other places.

As for your question, does fgetcsv() perform better? It would require 
you to process your file a line at a time rather than load it all into 
memory, but the actual parsing should be much faster.

Another idea is to write out a file with your SQL statements. Executing 
each query, one at a time, sounds really slow. Regardless of how 
complicated your queries are, you can still process them in a single 
batch. This would probably be as simple as:

$sql .=

You can write $sql to a file and let MySQL slurp it up in one go.

Hope that helps.

It depends on where the slowdown is. I'd agree with Chris, it would probably
be best to put an index on the email field (if there isnt one already), and
echo out the INSERTs with a newline. At that point you can just do php
script.php > import.sql. Just keep in mind indexes play a major role when
importing large amounts of data, especially when SELECTs are needed for each
row.

If the table isn't live or in production, it may go a lot faster if you drop
all the indexes on the table other than the primary key once you are ready
to run your INSERTs and re-add them when you are done.

Hey all:

First of all:  Happy New Year!

Secondly: I am rebuilding a site that was coded somewhat sloppily, 
and they have product images all stored in one directory (a script 
that I am not writing auto-uploads them to the web server from 
elsewhere).  Presently, this directory contains about 33,000 files. 
It will be more like 75,000 when the site launches, if things remain 
the same.

The question is:  should I be worried about this, or was this only a 
problem several years ago? (I remember people at one time attempting 
to not put too many files in one place.)

If I should be worried, what could happen?  Will we ever reach a hard 
limit of files per directory?

Is it better if each product instead has its own directory inside 
there (i.e., 75,000 directories), each with as many files as we need 
inside, or is that just the same problem?

Happy New Year to you as well!

What OS? 

Most unix filesystems have a set number of inodes and you need at least one inode per file. Files larger than the block size (4k-8k usually) take more than one inode. If you have shell access to the box try:

	df -i

It should tell you the number of inodes. The other issue you may have, even if this works, is if the box is a shared host for other clients. You'll take up a significant chunk of inodes.

That's what springs off the top of my head.

ciao!

Hi there:

Thanks for the response.

The OS will be Red Hat Enterprise 3 or 4; That will be determined 
when we get the server in February.

But, this will be a dedicated hosting box at 
servermatrix...whatever's in the client's price range at the time we 
buy (probably their low-end Pentium 4 server).  Anyway, it'll be our 
machine.

So, inodes are the only particular worry?  The directory structure is 
irrelevant?

I can see how things are working on my OS X development machine in 
the meantime, which has a hell of a lot more going on than will be 
going on on this server.

Cheers,

Marc

I don't know about performance, but it should at least work. Would hate to build an array off it though.

I've set up a test directory on a SuSE system. I also have a Red Hat 3 and Fedora Core 3 box at hand. If you have any tests you'd like to e-mail me feel free to send them over. I'll be diving tomorrow but might have time to run them Monday.

The ~/tmp/test directory is in export. It went from about 8% of inodes used to 22%. If you have a say in the building of the system and the files are small you can probably increase the inode count a bit. 

leam at leam:~/tmp/test> ls | wc -l
75001

leam at leam:~/tmp/test> df -i
Filesystem            Inodes   IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/hda5             787968  134582  653386   18% /
tmpfs                 129537       5  129532    1% /dev/shm
/dev/hda1              51400      36   51364    1% /boot
/dev/hda3             393984   85709  308275   22% /export

leam at leam:~/tmp/test> df -k
