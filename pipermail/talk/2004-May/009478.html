The pear port is never installed so that won't work.

It is also a problem in FreeBSD to install from Ports the mod_php and php
CLI ports at the same time. I think this is why Pear may be failing.

I am rebuilding my play box after a HD crash and I will experiment more
thene. Amongst the options I am considering so far is to install the CLI
on the play/test box and then make a tar of the files an copy them over to
the production box. Then manually change php.ini and anything else...

Although most likely my first option will be trying to install Pear by
manually and see if that is not too much work.

I think it's much simpler; usually, over-abstraction is a bad thing.
The original PHundamentals seed was this:

&quot;Something can always go wrong in an application so it is essential that

your application have an error handler. What types of errors can be=20
safely ignored, and which ones should be trapped by an error handler?=20
What is the best way to handle those errors?&quot;

I think the always important distinction of development vs production is
again vital when talking about error handling.

The first rule of error handling, in my view is to be alerted of ALL
errors, notices, warnings, etc.  As such, in php.ini I always have:

error_reporting  =3D  E_ALL

or if I can't modify my php.ini:

error_reporting(E_ALL);

is set in the top level include of my application.  I do this for both
dev and production environments (it's often more important in dev).  I
also ensure display_errors is off and log_errors is on.  This is all
automatically set correctly if you use php.ini-recommended

By default, with log_errors set to on, errors go to the Apache error
logs.  So:

tail -f /var/log/www/mydomain.com/error_log

(or whatever the path obviously)

will show all signs of errors, as they happen, without splashing errors
to the browser.  Even in development, errors dumped to the browser are
bad because they can become hidden in the HTML.

So, the big question; what is safe to ignore?  Basically, nothing.  I
always code so that I never have any warnings about uninitialized
variables, which is a common error (actually, notice) to ignore.  I
admit, there are times - like when repopulating form values on small
sites - when I will suppress an uninitialized variable using a @ if I'm
sure a NULL or 0 value will be handled correctly.  It's good practice to
not throw any &quot;sloppy&quot; errors in your application, and under any states
of the page; this is &quot;PHundamentally&quot; good programming.

So what about &quot;non-sloppy&quot; errors; or those errors caused by an
exceptional or unexpected condition?  For one, there are two sides to
this; what the user (browser) sees, and what the maintainer (developer)
sees.  Always - *always* - show a generic error to the user.  If the
database is offline, don't say &quot;Our database is currently offline&quot; but
rather &quot;System under maintenance&quot;.  If the system is about to crash and
PHP's core has become horribly corrupted:  &quot;System under maintenance&quot;

This does two things.  One, it makes it harder for crackers to fiddle
with your application - they never really know what they're doing or
what affect it has.  Two, it makes error handling much simpler and
eliminates complex class abstractions and hierarchies.

In most cases, these bits of code is what I use:

set_error_handler('myhandler');

if( $majorproblem ) {
   trigger_error('This is a major problem',E_USER_ERROR);
}

Then, the myhandler() function could look like:

function myhandler( $message,$code ) {
   mail('<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">siteadmin at domain.com</A>','MAJOR PROBLEM
at'.time(),trigger_dump($GLOBALS));
   error_log('MAJOR PROBLEM at '.time().trigger_dump($GLOBALS));
   go2('/error.php');
   exit;
}


I know that code won't really work and is horribly sloppy; if anyone
wants real code, let me know.  go2() is part of the this_server PCOM
(<A HREF="http://pcomd.net/this_server">http://pcomd.net/this_server</A>) to handler redirections and
trigger_dump() is the PCOM at <A HREF="http://pcomd.net/trigger_dump">http://pcomd.net/trigger_dump</A> as a wrapper
for dumping variables.

While many are probably shocked by the no-frills approach to this error
handling scheme, it's all I've never needed.  It's very &quot;un-enterprise&quot;
I know.  Look at it this way, when something goes wrong:

-- you need to know the state of the application; trigger_dump($GLOBALS)
-- you need to know when it happened; time()
-- you need to know that it happened; mail()
-- you need to have a record of the above three items; error_log()
-- you need to prevent the user from knowing any of this, except that it
happened; go2()

I'm also curious as to other's approach.  Granted, in PHP 5 we'll have
exceptions - which are a great thing - but doesn't really change that
much.  Exceptions are for *detecting* errors, no handling after the
fact.  I'm curious as to other's thoughts.

Bam... another good topic for an article?  This would be quite a tricky
article, though, since the difference can be very subtle and complex.

Good it's resolved Jayesh,
