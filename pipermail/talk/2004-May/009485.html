<PRE>Just for laughs I had to include the details of the 15-day $20 project:

Dear Bidders,

1. The new website needs to be coded preferably in asp. All pages need
to be linked to one another.

2. I need an internet radio for the website so that when a member
chooses a genre of music, media player will automatically open and start
to play that specific genre of music, but only the music of our members
that will be played by random. We will have further discussion on this.

3. A rating system where members will be able to rate other members.

4. Another rating system where members will be able to vote for their
favorite members and whomever gets the most votes in their genre will be
placed on our top 10 list.

5. There will be a calender for each member that they will have access
to and will be able to add and delete messeges on their calender.

6. There will be a mail system on our website that will only be
internal.

7. Information on how our members will be able to have their own address
from our website, meaning if a members username was 'meme', that member
could give the following address to someone so they may visit her on our
site:

[withheld so I wouldn't get sued]

8. There will also be a statistics page for every member, the statistics
page is for them to see how many people will view them often.

I think I have mentioned everything. If you haven't bid, I suggest you
bid now so that I may make my decision.

Thank you.
