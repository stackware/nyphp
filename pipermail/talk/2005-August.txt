Hi Pat, (Sorry, the first answer was pm...)

Maybe this is a result of my not perfect English, if so I am deeply
sorry. Basically I meant that Truestudio copies a lot of things of the
original JAVA IDE. For Example the Type hierarchy or the Open Type
function. Moreover the directories and the files are organized in the
PHP Explorer as Packages not as Folders etc.

Personally I like this style because some other languages I'm using
working the same way. And if you organize your projects in a PEAR
packages style it is a true advantage for me while developing...

I hope I could clarifiy my original intention.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Session Handling
Message-ID: <8d9a4280050801064770c117@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have implemented my session handling to take place in the database rather 
than flat files on the system. No i have a question. I read somewhere that 
it is always good to check the IP of the user to make sure the session has 
not been hijacked. Would the following be secure enough for that?


<?php

class session
{
/* Define the mysql table you wish to use with
this class, this table MUST exist. */
private $table = "sessions";
private $_db;
private $_page;
private $_sess_id;
private $_ip;


public function __construct(Database $db) {
$this->_db = $db;
}

public function init() {
$this->_sess_id = session_id();
$this->_page = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
$this->_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

$this->CheckIP();
}

public function open($path, $name) {

return TRUE;
}

/* Close session */
public function close() {
/* This is used for a manual call of the
session gc function */
$this->gc(0);
return TRUE;
}

/* Read session data from database */
public function read($ses_id) {

$session_sql = "SELECT * FROM " . $this->table
. " WHERE ses_id = '$ses_id'";
$session_res = $this->_db->Query($session_sql);
if (!$session_res) {
return '';
}

$session_num = $this->_db->NumRows($session_res);
if ($session_num > 0) {
$session_row = $this->_db->FetchArray($session_res);
$ses_data = $session_row["ses_value"];
return $ses_data;
} else {
return '';
}
}

/* Write new data to database */
public function write($ses_id, $data) {

$this->init();

$session_sql = "UPDATE " . $this->table
. " SET ses_time='" . time()
. "', page='".$this->_page
. "', ses_value='$data' WHERE ses_id='$ses_id'";
$session_res = $this->_db->Query($session_sql);
if (!$session_res) return FALSE;

if($this->_db->AffectedRows()) return TRUE;

$session_sql = "INSERT INTO " . $this->table
. " (ses_id, ses_time, ses_start, page, ip, ses_value)"
. " VALUES ('$ses_id', '" . time()
. "', '" . time() . "', '$this->_page', '$this->_ip', '$data')";
$session_res = $this->_db->Query($session_sql);
if (!$session_res) return FALSE;
else return TRUE;
}

/* Destroy session record in database */
public function destroy($ses_id) {
$session_sql = "DELETE FROM " . $this->table
. " WHERE ses_id = '$ses_id'";
$session_res = $this->_db->Query($session_sql);
if (!$session_res) return FALSE;
else return TRUE;
}

/* Garbage collection, deletes old sessions */
public function gc($life) {
$ses_life = strtotime("-5 minutes");

$session_sql = "DELETE FROM " . $this->table
. " WHERE ses_time < $ses_life";
$session_res = $this->_db->Query($session_sql);


if (!$session_res) return FALSE;
else return TRUE;
}

private function UpdatePage() {
$session_sql = "UPDATE ".$this->table." SET 
page='".mysql_real_escape_string($this->_page)."' WHERE 
ses_id='".$this->_sess_id."'";
$this->_db->Query($session_sql);
}

 private function CheckIP() {
$intIP = explode('.', $this->_ip);
$curIP = explode('.', $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
if( !strcmp($intIP, $curIP) ) {
$sess_sql = "DELETE FROM ".$this->table." WHERE 
ses_id='".$this->_sess_id."'";
$this->_db->Query($sess_sql);
session_destroy();
}
}
}
?>


Is this a good enough check for the IP? If the IP check fails it should 
remove the session from the database, but also it calls session_destroy Why 
did i do it this way rather than just calling $this->destroy() or just using 
session_destroy? I noticed that it was not actually removing the session 
from the database if i did not actuall make the database query myself. Any 
criticism would be appreciated as this is my first attempt at storing 
sessions in the database (with the help of a zend tutorial)

I've had similar questions regarding IP security.
We didn't use IP addresses to uniquely identify users because they were 
redundant.
We tried to hash browser agents and other items client items to identify 
users.
Here is the belief that I would also like to know a definitive answer to 
that made us not use IP addresses:
corporate networks, some schools, AOL, and other groups behind a 
gateway/router are all going to appear to be the same IP.
There was a "forwarded" ip that could append an internal IP with the 
gateway IP or something to that affect, but I haven't implemented 
anything like that and would like to know if it is practical.

We require cookies and SSL and that seems to do the trick for most 
secure apps.

If that's the case, then Apache Axis also ships with a thing called TCP
Monitor. It works fine and the price is right.

http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/user-guide.html#AppendixUsingTheAxisTCPMonitorTcpmon

It's apparently designed for people who are trying to debug SOAP
transactions but of course you can use it for whatever. I've had fun using
it as a teaching tool for introductory PHP students -- showing them all
that stuff that goes back and forth that you don't see in a graphical
browser.

Guys,

i am not sure why but when a session is hijacked the IP address in the

you can see that you can hijack a session by going to this page

http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/csaf/test.php?PHPSESSID=0615292083a9ea7010f1fe935597751e

you can also use a browser to open the page and create a session, then open 
a different browser like IE or Firefox (but not the same browser) and hijack 
your own session, as i have the page printing the session id so you can get 
it.

I am not sure why when a session is hijacked the IP in the database is 
updated, this should not be the case. The SQL query i have in my write

Any help i would really appreciate. I like the flexibility of sessions in 
the database but i dont like the idea of how easy it is to hijack the 
session without the system noticing and destroying it.

Guys,

I have the following code in use however people can easilly hijack sessions 
i am not sure why but when a session is hijacked the IP address in the 
database changes, yet the session values are retained. Here is the code.



<?php

class session

/* Define the mysql table you wish to use with
this class, this table MUST exist. */
private $table = "sessions";

you can see that you can hijack a session by going to this page

http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/csaf/test.php?PHPSESSID=0615292083a9ea7010f1fe935597751e

you can also use a browser to open the page and create a session, then open 
a different browser like IE or Firefox (but not the same browser) and hijack 
your own session, as i have the page printing the session id so you can get 
it.

I am not sure why when a session is hijacked the IP in the database is 
updated, this should not be the case. The SQL query i have in my write 
method should not do anything but insert or update if it exists.

Any help i would really appreciate. I like the flexibility of sessions in 
the database but i dont like the idea of how easy it is to hijack the 
session without the system noticing and destroying it.

it is an insert, i dont care atm if people see the session id's

but i did narrow it down to the query

something is wrong with the write method query. It seems to insert 
everytime, an update of all fields. any ideas why?

If you still want to view the full response from browser, you can
always use telnet.

to view nyphp.org/index.php

# telnet nyphp.org 80
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: nyphp.org

You need to press ENTER twice after "host: ..." line, to let the
webserver know that you are done typing in your request. That'll show
you the exact response including the headers and HTML.

BTW, this is from Mr. Shiflett's book, HTTP Developer's Handbook.

Joseph,

I trick I use often is that I check the session ID and the referrer before allowing 
the user to continue to the next page.  If the session Id and the referrer is not what I expect then
I send them back to the login page.
Is not infalable but it adds an extra layer.

Nestor :-)

Hi Joseph,

I see your query includes "INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE".  Is 
it possible that it's inserting a new row because there is no duplicate 
key? What are the keys on that table?

the primary key is the session id so it should find a duplicate key just 
fine. when i enter the query into phpmyadmin when there are no matching 
records it says it inserted one record, then when i do it again it says it 
inserted 2 records this leads me to believe that it deletes the existing 
record then inserts the new but that's not how the docs say it's supposed to 
work. REPLACE uses that functionality not the UPDATE KEY

Hi Joseph,

You may be experiencing a bug in MySQL.  See this:

What do you think?

Allen,

thanks for bringing this to my attention, i think i will have to bail on 
this method and check and then insert or update.

ok i now have another issue and thought i would seek help here once again ;)

the issue i am having is in the checkIP method, it checks the IP just fine 
and i had this working where it would delete the existing session and start 
a new one automatically however, if someone tried to hijack my session i 
wouldnt want to have to login all over again myself, i just want a new 
session started for the one who attempted to hijack my session.

i have tried to use output buffering with ob_start(); at the beginning of my 
file and ob_end_flush() at the end of my file, that doesnt seem to help with 
the error i am getting.

The following is the error i get 

*Warning*: session_regenerate_id() [function.session-regenerate-id]: Cannot 
send session cookie - headers already sent by (output started at 
E:\htdocs\csaf\test.php:10) in *E:\htdocs\csaf\lib\auth\session.php* on line 
*129*

the session id for the hijacker is never re-generated they continue to use 
the hijacked session id and it allows them to use the other person's 
session.

Worst case scenario is both users will have thier sessions reset by the 
script deleting the hijacked session from the database.

here is my code

<?php

Joseph,

Your code is tied into all kinds of knots, you need to strip out all the 
extra cruft and get it working right before you add all the features for 
user icons etc, or even better add them in a subclass.

Now, the reason your IP checking is not working is this:

In your init() function you set:

$this->_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

then you call CheckIp() which tests:

strcmp($this->_ip,$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'])

Of course this will always be true.

You need to do your IP checking in or after the read function, not 
before, because until it is read you don't know the previous IP.

On a side note IP checking isn't a great security measure because it 
will cause problems for anyone whose IP is likely to change during a 
session, such as AOL users, etc.

Hi All,

Could y'all recommend a dedicated server host at 60-70 / mo. w/ plesk? 
(and minimal setup fee). I currently have a VPS and it's a bit sluggish.

I've got a server with ServerMatrix, I've got root so the servers got whatever
I want on it. Getting it with plesk is an extra $20/mnth.
http://servermatrix.com/

I'm dropping $89/mnth for my server, with no plesk, so it's more than
you were looking to spend, but I've been very happy with the level of
service I've received over the past year (which really has just meant
that they don't bother me and the server never goes offline :) ).

Hrm, it looks like prices have gone up, wait for a sale :)

Dan,

can you offer a better way to check for hijacked sessions? I now do see that 
AOL users go through a proxy tunnel and thier ip can change a lot.

Further, if you're interested in rendered source (as opposed to the source 
as delivered before any client-side manipulation) there are several options:

The 'generated source' developer's bookmarklet (among many others):
http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html

The "View Formatted Source" firefox extension (Very nice implementation; you 
can collapse code blocks and other goodies):

The "View Renered Source" extension (consistently crashes firefox on amd64

see this link

I also use Server Matrix, although you would be better of referring to
them as the Planet. They have an outstanding network, uptime, speed
and reliability are top-notch. If you know what you're doing and can
admin your own server, you get root. Technical support is not great,
but someone please name a hosting company that has good
tech support. I know what Plesk is, never use it so...basically, for
advanced users who want a dedicated box with great reliability, I
recommend the Planet as well.

I don't have it on my desk so I can't quote chapter and verse, but Chris
Shiflett's HTTP Handbook has a section on session management that would
surely interest you. http://shiflett.org/books/http-developers-handbook

Thanks,

I just submitted an order for this book hopefully it will help me with this 
stuff ;)

Anyone here that can explain why this is happening?

with the current session class found below this is the issue

when the CheckSession method is called it compares the IP addresses from 
when the session first started and the current IP address. X.X.X.* (I am 
also trying to think of a non ip way to compare) it has no problems finding 
that it is a hijacked session, however when i call the destroy method (also 
tried session_unset(); session_destroy(); and get the same results) it 
deletes the hijacked session so the session_destroy() works. What it is 
doing (side effect of my coding i think) is keeping all the session info 
such as $this->_page, $this->_browser, $this->_ses_id, etc... and just 
inserting a new record with your IP etc.. but the $_SESSION info is retained 
so you still in essence get the hijacked data. Also session_destroy() 
whatever is happening after that allows you to keep the same session_id as 
the hijacked session, so when you look in the db all that changes really is 
the users IP address.

you can only see the results if you have DB access to change the IP in your 
session record or you have 2 machines with different ip addresses.

Pete,

I think you'd like Charles:

http://www.xk72.com/charles/

It does exactly what you're looking to do. I haven't played with it
extensively, but I believe that there's plugins for it that extend
it's usefulness. For what it's worth, I believe you'll need a plugin
to make it work with Firefox on windows. This is second hand
information though. It workls splendidly with IE.

Sounds like that.  So by "getting written every time" I assume you mean a 
brand new session file with a new name.

Yes, that's it.  Every request, a new session file is written, with a 
new name.  So, it has permissions to write, but it is almost like it 
can't read.  There's nothing in the error log, and turning on all PHP 
errors doesn't provide any help, either.

What a weird problem....

Another one to consider:

also, take a look at all the tools on that site, pretty handy.

Hello,
A while ago I've seen some code (function) to build SQL queries. It took a 
multidimentional associative array to build complex WHERE conditions. That's 
the feature that I really liked. I'm trying to find it again to no avail. 
Can someone point me to that code please?

Thanks,

File permissions could be it.  But more likely, now that I think about it, 
is your browser is probably not accepting/sending the PHPSESSID cookie 
from/to your server.  Either look in your browser's cookie list and/or put 
a test at the top of your script that checks $_COOKIE['PHPSESSID'].

Rather than being lazy and making us do your work for you, how about 
posting an idea of how you'd do it and we'll give you feedback.

If you don't have any ideas, you've got to do some reading to do on how to 
use PHP.  Check out the foreach() syntax in the PHP manual.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] persnickety problem while (reverse) proxying JPSpan
	(AJAX library)
Message-ID: <5e2aaca405080213133f774356@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wondering if anyone has insight into this problem....

I have JPSpan setup to run (within a Horde installation), and reverse
proxied through another server (giving external users access to the
application by way of the proxy server).  When I am not using the
proxy, a simple "HelloWorld" test succeeds.  However, when the proxy
is used, I get the following error:

Server_Error: syntax error
The client was helloworld calling sayhello
The response was 

new Function("var t1 = \'Hello Greg\';return t1;");


The strange part is that the response is perfectly valid JS code, and
can be eval'd in the JavaScript console just fine.  I am under the
impression, and you can verify for me, that this is what JPSpanServer
is supposed to return.  I was unsure about where the escaped single
quotes were coming from, and so I turned off magic_quotes_gpc on the
proxy server and restarted, but that had no effect.  It is entirely
possible that the magic_quotes are introduced somewhere in the Horde
Framework, but seems irrelevant since the server response is valid JS
code even when the single quotes are escaped. I'm still confused why
this is getting reported as a syntax error.

Is there a method in PostOffice that I could use to inspect the return
response of a successful sayhello call? -- simply to compare it with
the error version?

I have been running through the examples to note any change in
behavior between the straight version, and the proxied version.  I
discovered another bizarre issue:  The
/lib/jpspan/examples/testclient.php works fine when requested
directly, but when proxied, the closing tags of some of the xml.js
content are missing.
For example, the '</r>' in line 782 of http://pastebin.com/327779 or
in more detail: the attached diff compares the output of
testclient.php (normal) and testclient.php (proxied).  NOTE that this
case does not involve Horde in any way, so it certainly isn't due to
namespace collisions.

I have reviewed my mod_proxy_html rules, and there is nothing that
resembles the transformation taking place; leaving me with absolutely
no explanation.

proxy rules (real name was changed to 'appAliasFoo' to protect the innocent :-)

       ProxyHTMLURLMap / /appAliasFoo/ c
        ProxyHTMLURLMap /appAliasFoo /appAliasFoo c
        # This handles the ab theme graphics
        ProxyHTMLURLMap '= \'/autobuilder/' '= \'/appAliasFoo/autobuilder/' Rh
        # A rewrite rule that ignores links, and targets js
        ProxyHTMLURLMap '= \'/themes/graphics/([^./]+)\.png' '=
\'/appAliasFoo/themes/graphics/$1.png' R
        # A rewrite rule that tries to take care of the dynamically
generated js of the treemenu
        # This rule does not impact the embedded js loaded by
javascript.php, so a hack was put into tree.js
        #ProxyHTMLURLMap '/themes/graphics/tree/([^.]+)\.png'
'/appAliasFoo/themes/graphics/tree/$1.png' R
        # The following rule interferred with administration.png when
the trailing / was left out
        ProxyHTMLURLMap /admin/ /appAliasFoo/admin/ h
        ProxyHTMLURLMap /services/ /appAliasFoo/services/ h
        ProxyHTMLURLMap /login.php /appAliasFoo/login.php h


I don't know that there is any bug in JPSpan, but I'm at my wits end
in trying to figure out what is causing this not to work.

Thanks for your help.

Dan,
Thanks for your "helpful" response and for labeling me. All I asked was if 
someone knew what function I was referring to and where to find it. I did 
not request anyone to do my work.
I do know "how to use PHP" better than you have assumed ... and guess what 
.. I also know how to use foreach(). The code I was referring to could build 
"multi-level" WHERE conditions with multiple ANDs and OR based on the 
structure of the passed array. foreach() in not quiet all of the concept 
behind it.
I believe my question was clear and I didn't ask it because I'm lazy or 
because I'm not able to come up with a solution myself. I asked it simply 
because I have a deadline tomorrow and I 'm trying to save some time by not 
reinventing the wheel. I think any smart programmer would do the same in my 
situation.

Your response however, was neither an answer to my question nor an advise. I 
actually think it was quiet rude and I'm lucky it's not an IRC channel, 
because I'm sure you'd ban me without thinking twice for asking a question.

I've been a member of NYPHP for a few years and I hope that the list is 
still a place where people can ask questions. Correct me if I'm wrong.


Thanks,
O.

Ok so i figured i would post this here since others may be wondering about 
this too.

I couldnt figure out why when i was using output buffering that in my 
destroy method the session_regenerate_id() function would be complaining 
about the headers already being sent.

After a few days of struggling with this i ran a debug session with zend 
studio and found that even after the page is displayed and output buffering 
is flushed the session class runs one last time, it calls the write method 
which in turn called my init method and when the session was destroyed it 
would call the session_regenerate_id() function and it would complain 
because the page was already sent to the browser.

i guess my question here is do any of you guru's know how i can accomplish 
this? I tried to put the call to my init method into my read method but then 
it complained that i was trying to destroy a non existant session. Where can 
i put these checks that will run with each page load. I tried the 
constructor but that only seemed to run just one time, not once per page, 
just once.

Yup, works from home. Might be a "proxy avoidance" filter at work. Never 
mind......

Sometimes when people use AOL, the proxied http requests come in from 
multiple ip's.

I finally solved this problem in realizing that you cannot run the IP (or 
other method) check within the session class rather you have to have a 
normal function that get's called right after session_start(); This solved 
my problems and allowed me to change the users session_id when a session was 
hijacked. Also i turned COOKIES ONLY to on using ini_set so users can no 
longer use the querystring. Now i need to figure out a way to check if 
cookies can be set, if not dont allow them to use the site ;)

Rolan,

I have been trying to think of a method to use that wouldnt rely on the IP 
at all, however i cant base it on the user agent because how many people use 
IE and or FireFox? I cannot base it on the session id as that is what i am 
detecting someone hijacked and then i destroy the session. What else could i 
check? I guess i could use some javascript on the main page to grab some odd 
info from the user maybe something about thier hardware but i am not sure 
how that would go. I am sure Amazon, etc.. dont do that but yet they still 
secure thier sessions..... How?

Here's a possiblity you should look at (sorry if I'm repeating myself):

ok so i finally got the session stuff working, everything is working as 
expected... almost

if you go to 
http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/csaf/test.php
and refresh a few times, keep your eye on the Type icon. then click the 
Test2 link, notice the Type icon hasnt changed, refresh it changes. 
Everything seems to be 1 page behind. Anyone know of a work around for this, 
aside from adding a refresh to each page.

i should also note that it's not a cache issue as i have added the following 
meta tags to both test.php and test2.php

<META HTTP-EQUIV="CACHE-CONTROL" CONTENT="NO-CACHE">
<META HTTP-EQUIV="PRAGMA" CONTENT="NO-CACHE">

and it still lags by one refresh. This only happens to the record for the 
active user, i understand why it happens what i dont understand is how i can 
do a work around. It loads test2.php reads the sessions, writes the new 
session and shows the page, what i need is for it to write then read ;)

Joseph,

That is because the session data is not written until you close the 
page, so the updated data isn't visible until the page is refreshed.

If you want to be able to see the current data, you need to rework the 
way the system is designed to write that data on page load rather than 
when the session is saved, or determine it on page load, store/display 
it in/from a global variable and write it with the session.

If I understand your issue, the session needs one extra step to refresh:
I used to do a "redirect" , not a html refresh if that's what you mean.
a
header('location: etc etc');

I am not sure why sessions lag one step behind.

Dan,

thanks for the info i was trying to determine if i could make php's internal 
sessions read before write but i guess it cannot, i will have to do one of 2 
things.

1.) create my own session managment
2.) create the work around storing the values in the session as you 
suggested.

Jonathan,

it is always one step behind because of the way sessions work, it reads the 
current session then writes the new session. so it's reading the old and 
writing the new, i am not sure if there is a way to make php's session write 
then read or not i also dont know if that would be logical to do.

Joseph,

There is nothing stopping you from updating the session record from 
within the session read callback, and in fact it can be beneficial 
because your write function will then always have a record to update, 
and doesn't need to worry about insert capability.

Dan,

the issue with the read method is this.

when session_start() is called the user type is unknown. the user type is 
set when i do

$user = new Admin();
$user = new Client();
etc..

i am trying to think of a way to make this take place before the 
session_start because then it would work fine i think. Right now if i use 
the read method it registers every user as a Guest.

Joseph,

In that case just have your script insert/update the session table with 
the page-specific data when you know it, like:

1. start session

2. check logins, etc

3. insert/update session page data/type/etc

4. do real processing

5. save session data

you would probably want to only use the save callback (step 5) to update 
the actual session contents, and use your own script to manage the rest 
of the data (in step 3).

Adding a lock field to the session table may not be a bad idea either to 
prevent multiple or popup windows etc from messing up the session.

http://shiflett.org/code/http-developers-handbook/session_example.phps

guys i have a few questions about this.

here is the snipplet i am concerned with

 # Make sure the user agent is correct
$ua_should_be = urldecode($parsed_cookie['ua']);
if ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] != $ua_should_be)
{
$identity_validated = false;
}

does that seem redundant to anyone else? Why would you store a value in a 
cookie (on the clients machine) and then use that to compare to php's 
HTTP_USER_AGENT, couldnt the client just edit the cookie to be the same? 
Then once they go to the page it will see it as valid.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SQL 'WHERE' conditions in an array
In-Reply-To: <ea8ff1d2050802124743565a05@mail.gmail.com>

You may want to look up "binary decision trees".  This is not precisely
what you are looking for but it is closely related and may give you some
background.

The basic idea behind any generated SQL statement is the fact that SQL
statements that follow certain rules can themselves can be stored entirely
in scalar data.

Imagine this simple array:

$Query = Array
(
   "tables"=> Array
   (
       [0] = Array
       (
          "table_name"=>"customers"
       )
   )
)

or the more detailed:

$Query = Array
(
   "tables"=> Array
   (
       [0] = Array
       (
          "table_name"=>"customers"
          "columns"=> Array
          (
             "column1",
             "column2",
             "column3"
          )
       )
   )
)

Your code just loops through building a SELECT clause from the tables.  If
it cannot find the "columns" sub-array it puts in "*", else it lists the
columns in that array.

Everything else is just an embellishment of this, and of course remember
TIMTOWTDI.

I am the original poster of the http analyzer thread.

I have been following the thread and find it very interesting.

I ma intrigued by:

I will try both.  They both seem to be java based.  At one time I

One thing that comes to mind is that sometimes users will hand off the
URL with session ID to a robot (downloader/screen scraper), which can
emulate the USER_AGENT. However, if you store it in the cookie as
well, you'll know when the robot is unable to reproduce the cookie
variables.

Just a thought.

Hi all,

I've installed Apache2 on my CentOS box, however, I cannot get it to
load SSL when it starts with the system. It only start apache on port
80, without SSL. My installation is done from the source. However, I
did take apart the 2.0.52 RPM from CentOS. The init script it provide
didn't also help.

Can anyone point me to the right direction?

guys is this a bit better way to check session validity?

define('SES_KEY', 
md5('custom_string'.$_ENV['PROCESSOR_REVISION'].$_ENV['PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE'].$_ENV['PROCESSOR_LEVEL'].'custon_string'));

$this->_key = md5($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].SES_KEY.$ses_id);

that value is created and stored in the db on session start, then in my 
CheckSession function i am doing this

if( $key !== $data['identifier'] )

this ends up creating an identifier similar to this

733f97f78f00cd6d2f0d7955698ebac4a2aad2e4fb76d0a5862838e087a20251

this is based on the users agent, the initial session key, and some server 
stuff with some custom strings that i put in there.

This works just fine i just wanted to know if it would be easy for someone 
to hijack a session with this added security. I am also wondering if i 
should set a cookie, i am not yet sure that i want the user to be able to 
log back in after they close thier browser, i mean atleast not without going 
through the login form

I have also implemented this function 

function str_mix($str1, $str2) {
if(strlen($str1) != strlen($str2)) return FALSE;
else {
$len1 = strlen($str1);
$string = '';
for($x = 0; $x <= $len1; $x++) {
$string .= $str1{$x}.$str2{$x};
}
return $string;
}
}

i thought of using str_shuffle but that gives different results every time, 
this basically just takes the 1st letter from the 1st string and the 1st 
letter from the 2nd string combines etc.. basically every other letter is 
string1 every other letter is string2.

Joseph,

Your function would work the same way if it was:

$this->_key = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];

If the attacker spoofs the client's HTTP_USER_AGENT string as well as 
the session id they will pass the test.

Thus it doesn't actually provide any real added protection against 
session hijacking, because any attacker who can get hold of the session 
id will also be able to determine and spoof the user agent string.

I wish I had a 'silver bullet' solution to the problem that I could 
recommend to you, but I don't.

Dan

Dan,

thanks for pointing this out, i just thought that basing the identifier on 
more than just the clients stuff would help a bit, but i guess you're right 
the server stuff really wont make a difference. I would incorporate time() 
but then when i compare they wont be the same since i will have to 
re-generate the id, that is unless i uses ses_start time, that never changes

i have some ideas i am going to flow with thanks... :)

I'm not 100% sure about the init scripts on CentOS, but you might need
to add a "-D SSL" into your /etc/sysconfig/httpd file's OPTIONS var.  I
assume this is the same as the /etc/conf.d/apache2 in gentoo where I
know that to be the case.

HTH,
Andrew

Thank Andrew. I just added OPTIONS="-DSSL" to my
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd. Worked like a charm.

It gave me a chuckle to see "-DSSLing httpd:" instead of "Starting httpd" :-)

Excellent.  FYI, this works by defining a variable that trips apache's
config into loading the SSL module.  It is most likely in a block like
this in your apache config:

  <IfDefine SSL>
    <IfModule !mod_ssl.c>
      LoadModule ssl_module    extramodules/mod_ssl.so
    </IfModule>
  </IfDefine>

Followed by the SSL config wrapped in a block that is conditional based
on the module being loaded like:
  <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
  #SSL config...
  </IfModule>

> It gave me a chuckle to see "-DSSLing httpd:" instead of "Starting httpd" :-)

It is satisfying to see a flexible config systems work as expected and
needed, huh? :-)

Andrew

I agree that is difficult to find a silver bullet solution. The internet 
itself has its limits with identity management, and perhaps that's good.
Because of those limitations, security is as much about policy as 
technology.

Generally combining cookies (that can't be hijacked with cross-site 
scripting js), a server side script to create unique and user aware 
hashes, and SSL the network is  secure works well. There is a cost 
/benefit for a hijacking - if hijacking becomes increasingly complex, 
you have to be hiding something good to motivate anyone to come in. For 
example, if someone hijacked a users session in your system, what's the 
worst they could do? Could they get credit card information and pictures 
of the user naked? Or would the user only be able to post to NYPHP in 
their name? If the second is true you can always logging activity and 
communicating with the user, say sending an email confirmation like "You 
posted this" when you are really saying "Did you really post this?" I 
mean, security is really just a /sense/ of security.

It's easier to write code that works with sessions because it is a 
simple policy: once you log in, you're in. But, if there is something 
particularly sensitive you may want to verify identity again, like 
asking for the password again, or a captcha, or sending an email.

Sorry - I know I'm not giving code examples and you are in an 
implementation phase, but generally these steps have worked for me.

I think i finally got everything working the way i want it, i generate the 
hash and store it along side the session id, whenever the page is loaded it 
get's the hash from the db, and calculates the user s hash, if they match 
nothing is done, if they dont session_destroy is called and 
session_regenerate_id is called so the new user doesnt get the same session 
id as the one hijacked. Next i will implement a way to only do the check 
every X page loads for the user or something because every page querying 
this check could become resource intensive. I took a look at implementing 
adam's suggestion of regenerating the session id with every page load, i 
looked at doing this and then updating the current db record with the new id 
etc.. this would work if my hash didnt include the current session_id. The 
way it is now if i regenerate every page, every other page thinks the 
session has been hijacked ;)

Maybe sometime down the road i will look at implementing this ability as i 
am sure it's a small restructure problem but i think it's ok for now ;)

Now i get to work on my user managment and permissions system, figure out 
how i am going to implement the roles and who has what role ;)

Joseph,

Sounds like you're making progress.

As for changing the session id on every page load, this can easily break 
session support when the user clicks the 'back' button or opens multiple 
windows if not done very carefully.

If you're looking for something to help you with managing an ACL type 
permissions system I would recommend phpGACL 
(http://phpgacl.sourceforge.net).  I'm a little biased as I engineered 
its database structure, but it sounds like it may be what you're looking 
for.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Apache look back functionality and PHP
Message-ID: <1F3CD8DDFB6A9B4C9B8DD06E4A7DE358EF268F@network.PLMresearch.com>

I've been trying to use a PHP front-end script for Imagemagick as described
at evolt.org (see http://www.evolt.org/article/PHP_front-end
<http://www.evolt.org/article/PHP_front-end> _to_ImageMagick/17/55650/ )
The script relies upon $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] and  Apache's look back to find
the front-end script (magick.php).  The idea of the magick.php script is to
accept Imagemagick commands embedded in a URL.  
 
Abstract:
 
"The script will enable us to give convert commands by changing the query
string. Maybe a simple example will better explain this idea. You've got an
image: http://wwww.example.com/img/image.jpg. You copy the ImageMagick
script magick.php to the same directory. The image is now also available as
http://www.example.com/img/magick.php/image.jpg. So far, your image hasn't
changed. Now, imagine you want a thumbnail of the image with a width of
exactly 200 pixels. You can get that image by requesting the url:
http://www.example.com/img/magick.php/image.jpg?resize(200)."
 
For the life of me, I can't get Apache to look back and find the magick.php
script, rather it simply looks at image.jpg and assumes it's a subdirectory.
Has anyone had any experience with this script (a PHP front-end to
ImageMagick as described at evolt.org) or Apache's look back functionality?

Well, I don't know anything about magick.php, but this should work with 
Apache.  These URLS give identical results:

http://www.nyphp.org/ - Apache uses default document
http://www.nyphp.org/index.php - exact URL
http://www.nyphp.org/index.php/foo/bar/baz/ - searches backwards until 
it finds index.php

So, the URL

http://www.example.com/magick.php/image.jpg/foobar/

should search backwards until it finds magick.php and hits it, and 
magick.php would then have the path_info to do something with, such as 
get, mangle, and output your image file.

This Apache directive defaults to on (AFAIK) but perhaps you've turned 
it off:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#acceptpathinfo

If you want to to develop for these plaforms XHTML-basic should work.
As for javascript support I am not sure what browser the nokia has but 
my Zaurus ran Opera (slowly)
My Zaurus also ran apache, PHP, ssh, etc.

Thanks for the input.  That's what I thought.  I'm running Apache 1.3** and
I think the acceptpathinfo directive was default on back then.  Wonder if it
has something to do with the Zend debugger configured on the server?  I get
really weird results in the $_SERVER array that look a lot like the Zend
stuff (e.g. dummy.php)

Well, I don't know anything about magick.php, but this should work with 
Apache.  These URLS give identical results:

http://www.nyphp.org/ - Apache uses default document
http://www.nyphp.org/index.php - exact URL
http://www.nyphp.org/index.php/foo/bar/baz/ - searches backwards until 
it finds index.php

So, the URL

http://www.example.com/magick.php/image.jpg/foobar/

should search backwards until it finds magick.php and hits it, and 
magick.php would then have the path_info to do something with, such as 
get, mangle, and output your image file.

This Apache directive defaults to on (AFAIK) but perhaps you've turned 
it off:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#acceptpathinfo

I rely on Apache's lookback quite a bit and never have any trouble even 
across numerous hosts. Maybe take a close look at the script/parse 
instructions and your placement of the "?" in that query string. I think 
you need safe mode off for image magik, right?

Maybetry a lookback example using a basic test script, before debugging 
the image magik scripts?

Message-ID: <0IKP004TRZ7MCF60@mta3.srv.hcvlny.cv.net>

Wonder if anyone encountered this. I'm trying to install a printer driver on
WinXP Pro. The driver is in the form of a self-unzipping exe. Once unzipped,
it tries to run the setup procedure but an error message appears that
mentions the inability to run a 16 bit subsystem. I've tried the following:
 
a) Running from a DOS prompt
b) Setting the "compatibility" properties for setup.exe.
 
Needless to say (but of course...I'm saying it), nothing has worked.
 
Is there something I'm overlooking?

Have you tried telling windows to find a printer, then when asked
specifying the self extracted directory as the location of the
drivers?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Question about using ACL to direct user
Message-ID: <5458518f05080423443b0c4ad4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I'm in the process of designing a new application and I'm thinkin about 
using .htaccess files as my primary security device. Basically, I'll have my 
applications home directory. When the user hits that directory they will be 
prompted to log in by the default box the browser pops up for those things. 
Depending on the group that their username belongs to, they will be directed 
to either the /staff subdirectory or the /admin subdirectory. 

My questions are these:

1) Can I group users in an .htaccess file according to certain groups?
2) How can I retreive the username and group associated with the information 
the user provides via ACL?

I'm pretty sure this can be done but I'm not too sure how to do it. Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

It (Windows) didn't like that approach (surprisingly).
One suggestion I had gotten was to try safe mode and, failing that, do some
registry hacking (turns out this is a known Windows issue).

The Register is the second source in as many days reporting this
headline. Obviously, in our world, PHP is vibrant and strong.  But, if
the macro signs are pointing toward a downward trend, should we be at
least a *little* alarmed?

This may sound naive, but.. do they really think ASP and JSP are
replacing PHP in the world?

Is this just a stunt so Zend can hand out Netcraft numbers and use its
name in the same sentense as "Intel, SAP, Oracle and IBM"?  Let's see a
raise of hands.. who is going to run PHP on IIS?

So, what does EDC do when they sober up and try to do real work? Having seen how the "big boys" play with their Java based Webspehre and Weblogic, I'll take PHP nay day. So far PHP hasn't taken several minutes to start up, hasn't dropped half-gig core files on my server, and hasn't required a slew of developers to get simple tasks done.

I'm personally getting disgusted with the news media. They take something they know nothing about and try to get ratings by making whatever they stumble across seem important.

Back to something of interest. This past weekend I noticed something funny, keep an eye out and it might return. Or maybe I'm just inhaling the same fumes as EDC. I normally keep a tab on Cnn.com, using Firefox 1.0.6 on Fedora Core 4. Several times this past weekend the little icon on CNN's tab turned to the 4 "S" logo of Sun! Too funny...

ciao!

I wonder how much of this is due to pacific rim outsourcing of corporate 
web site construction?  I know from experience that Indian outsource 
companies have little interest or investment in open source languages 
like PHP and Perl.  Java, ASP and .NET rule there, possibly because the 
developers learned their craft through universities and commercial 
training/certification courses.

It strikes me that it is the other way 'round
ASP and JSP are established -- and it is PHP which 
is doing the replacing...

Not replacing existing stuff, of course -- 
but creating an alternative for new projects. 

IBM legitimized personal computers in an era 
when you could find personal computers right  
next to the toy section in Radio Shack. 

I think IBM's support for PHP will make some people 
look at PHP in a different light.

True Story:

Startup spends 3 million over 18 months trying to offer a Java
solution.  Can't get it to work. PHP programmer comes in,  does 90% of
the project over the weekend. Ask VC, lets get the thing out the door.
 VC says has to be written in Java, programmer says "WTF?".  Makes no
sense at all.  Why Java?  VC says,  "We heard Java was the buzz. I

Needless to say 3 months later they folded.  25 people out of work.

Hey Folks,

I'm looking for information on APC (Alternative PHP Cache).  Anyone here 
use it, have any experiences with it, found good info on it, have 
debugging and optimization tips, etc.  I haven't found much 
documentation on it.  So far, the best info I found was in the INSTALL 
file, which actually listed the ini options available.  I have it built 
and installed, but it really doesn't seem to be doing much for my 
application (running PHP 5.0.4/Apache 1.3.33 on Linux), and in fact, it 
causes some pages not to work.

Any other caches I should look at.  I've heard good things about Zend, 
but unfortunately their license doesn't work with my application's 
distribution model, so I really can't use it.

Tips and advice greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Tom

Preaching to the choir - but I'm diggin' it.

I wrote a J2ME  app. Spent 2 weeks to create a login form that used Java 
RMI, then SOAP.
THen spent 10 minutes writing a XHTML-basic /php solution.
Egads!
Not ready for the Enterprise? Why? Scalibility? Or because the 
Enterprise needs to spend money and _sound_ good.

PHP rocks. But to play devil's advocate, I was at the Boston PHP meeting
last night and one person said that he would not use PHP for certain
large enterprise apps because of its lack of threading support. Not sure
what this means or if it's a valid point, but I'm sure you'll do and can
comment.

r.e. that startup. I hope it wasn't in one of the crappy vintage 2000 VC
funds that I'm in! Live and learn...

As far as writing multithreaded applications in php, George 
Schlossnagles book (pg 130) points out ways of using Child processes for 
multi-tasking on Unix systems - or you can always import java classes 
into PHP :-/
Maybe java needs multithreading because it doesn't want to _appear_ to 
be slow. ;)

Cliff,
 I just moved from Boston to Florida. Wish I had gone to the meetings there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SOAP Security?
Message-ID: <CA50708E-EAEA-493B-94D8-98FD2C260EE1@coolmacgames.com>

I have a task manager that I created in PHP over 2 years ago.  Our  
company now has a intranet and they want to tie in the task manager.

I have used SOAP to retrieve the list of tasks but how can I handle  
User Authentication.  The one method that I was planning is have the  
intranet site login the user. If login is valid then generate a token  
and store it into a MySQL HEAP table. The SOAP result is a token and  
is sent with each request. With each request if the token is valid I  
will update it's LastAccess field in the database.  Is there a flaw  
with this method?

Thanks,
John

Subject: [nycphp-talk] screen resolution redirection with php
Message-ID: <200508051604.22272.henry@beewh.com>

Hi all:

I'm looking for a solution to my problem or if anybody can point me in the 
right direction so I can figure it out on my own.

Here's the situation:
I want to know what screen resolution a user is using. I found that this can 
be done with javascript. I found this function that does this and 
redirects...

function redirectPage() {
var url640x480 = "http://www.yoursite.com/640x480";
var url800x600 = "http://www.yoursite.com/800x600";
var url1024x768 = "http://www.yoursite.com/1024x768";
if ((screen.width == 640) && (screen.height == 480)) 
window.location.href= url640x480;
else if ((screen.width == 800) && (screen.height == 600))
window.location.href= url800x600;
else if ((screen.width == 1024) && (screen.height == 768))
window.location.href= url1024x768;
else window.location.href= url640x480;
}


But i dont want this...i want to save in a cookie or $_SESSION variable the 
resolution info and based on that use one css, or another, use an include or 
not. etc...

How can i handle this with php? is there a way? or am I stuck with javascript 
(which i know that is not 100% solution, since a user can turn off in 
browser), but in that case i can create a default design, css, etc for those 
cases.

I was thinking of creating a cookie with javascript and then accessing that 
cookie with a php code. Just a thought....

Can anyone help me, point me in the right direction or share how you solved 
this issue?

Henry

Henry,

A cookie set by the browser is a good way to do this.

If this was important, I'd say it's time to track the fundng for this 
company cause it sounds so much like marketing fud. Since it's not 
important, don't bother. PHP is about utility, not brand. That's 
important for everybody here except maybe Zend, who probably has to care 
about articles like this one. We don't -- we got here by getting the job 
done, and PHP enables us to do that. Okay everybody on this list that 
has never used any other language than PHP raise your hand. I thought 
so. We all have used what it took to get the job done, and will probably 
keep doing that.

Like Jeff Siegel said -- the kool aid is very powerful. This article 
confirms that PHP is now a valid threat, worthy of attention and 
resources from those with alot to lose.  Remember what Red Hat went thru 
as the first "legitimate" Linux distro? When I visited RedHat's campus 
in the earlier days  I couldn't miss the quote on the big wall as you 
entered the building (I see they still use it as 
religion:http://www.redhat.com/truthhappens/)

Bleeding edge might be Backpackit.com which is way cool, but has it's 
oddities, runs as a web service, and requires some new thinking about

In a perfect web world it might be awesome... as I suppose it is for

Joseph,

>From learning any good/new technique point of view it is good that you learn generating this kind of hard to break session keys, but from real world point of view, there is not much difference between PHP's standard session and yours custom made, because this is siutation like you are creating/modifying your existing lock bigger, stronger and harder to break but it's solutions to break/open it remains same like key is hanging near to your lock so anybody who knows how to open can open it easily. I am pointing at spoofing of session ids through analyzing network or by other methods. In that sense no matter how sronger you make your lock, there remains same key to open it. So you may think in both direction; lock as well as key.

Thanks

  Dan,

  thanks for pointing this out, i just thought that basing the identifier on more than just the clients stuff would help a bit, but i guess you're right the server stuff really wont make a difference.  I would incorporate time() but then when i compare they wont be the same since i will have to re-generate the id, that is unless i uses ses_start time, that never changes

  i have some ideas i am going to flow with thanks... :)

I doubt that this EMEA survey knowingly or unknowingly based upon only those companies or programmers who really do not have idea about all technologies available in the market and what suits them.

Specially in Indian subcontinent, there is still bureaucracy at management level so what technology is to be selected to build application depends upon them rather than software people who actually are going to develop it. So you know what can happen in this situation.

And how they select any existing technology from market is entirely dependent upon mouth marketing. See real time example of a small scale company going to be started, where Mr. X of company XXX software calls another company (about selection of technology to build applications), which is his relative's or who he knows better, to Mr. Y of YYY soft.

================================

X: Hello Y, how is everything?
Y: Fine thanks, and you?
X: Same, just started new business you know software development and outsourcing to America (what country is this? actually they point to US) and Canada.
Y: Good to hear, best luck.

X: Ybhai (it is tradition in India to call any person whom you are talking with), I need advice about what software is to be selected in building applications? I think PHP is in news, is it good to select it? What are you using it?

Y: Xbhai, We use Java and ASP.Net because you know how easy it to install and you know whole world is using it without any trouble. You know Java supports threading, multitasking (this person really doesn't know whether multithreading really requires in software and application that they build or not), it is robust and made by Sun where my relative works in America and he recommended it to use. And ASP by world's richest man you know Bill gates. Above both are easy to find from market and not much problems in maintenance. And if any virus attacks are there, Format everything and start again.

X: Ok, good we will choose this for our development as well. Brother tomorrow our programmer will come to your office to burn CDs of software that you have, so we will not need to find it from market, you know now pirated CDs are not of good quality.

Y: Ok, no problem. Avjo (Avjo means Bye).

================================

Software developers who are really going to write code and to build applications can't give much feedback because it is question of their job and bread & butter, no choice. So they continue with what it is there.

Now tell me who the hell is going to use PHP and other open source technologies, when scenario is like this where top management is not interested in digging the truth about what software can really provide solution to their need, and will not require more investment in proprietary software.

People here (maybe in most of the world) like buzzwords like "Enterprise, Very costly, Robust, What a GUI, Easy to learn, Most available in market, .NET, Bill gates, Classes, Multithreading, Secure, Because my relative in America uses it, Because it is very costly but easily available from market through piracy etc." rather than actual usability of software and technologies, so if 1 company has adopted anything, other one will most likely to chose same. Where comes real time survey here to actually find what people really wants.

However only medium and large scale companies are aware of Open source software and actually using them, but figure of such companies are not that much in comparison with small scale companies. (I call these small scale companies as Hawkers.)

Even in education system, there is not any awareness of Open source software and still old software are being taught like Dos, FoxPro, Fortran, Dbase etc. just because they do not have expertise in new technologies like Linux, PHP, Mysql. And most importantly they do not want to get changed. Something is going, let it go. So it is luck by chance here that whether new company will adopt FOSS or Proprietary software.

Interestingly, I just have been appointed to takes lectures in colleges of our region about subject "Computers applications to managers" for management students. And since they didn't know what technology, software to be taught for this, they asked me to prepare course curriculum for them. They needed teaching of something like Computers introduction, an OS and Office like suits. Since I am open source lover, I told them that I will teach them about Linux, and Openoffice and they said Ok. So management students are now learning "Application of FOSS in their business". Hence to spread FOSS more and more, we should target Top level management rather than bottom level programmers because only top level is most of the time going to take decision about everything. Interesting paradox, isn't it.

I am not here comparing 2 sides Proprietary and Open source, but just depicting true picture of situation in our subcontinent. So we know what it appears is not truth always. However scenario is changing and more and more software companies are adopting open source standard but still it is much slower then expected.

I know I am deviated here from main topic, but I felt to say something to this community and this group about what actuality is.

Enjoy!

  I wonder how much of this is due to pacific rim outsourcing of corporate 
  web site construction?  I know from experience that Indian outsource 
  companies have little interest or investment in open source languages 
  like PHP and Perl.  Java, ASP and .NET rule there, possibly because the 
  developers learned their craft through universities and commercial 
  training/certification courses.

Message-ID: <200508060646.j766kXF0024291@centrifuge1.centrifugeit.com>

Hi all,

 

I have multiple domains but only a single IP address and I'd like to support
encrypted connections for certain operations like login, credit card info,
secure file upload and download, etc.  I've heard a lot about how SSL can't
be used with name based virtual hosting but I'm still looking for a solution
that does not force me to set up a separate IP for each domain that has
needs for secure operations.  I've had a couple of ideas that I think might
work but I'd like a few other smart folks to bounce the idea off if
possible.

 

 

 

1.  IPTABLES + APACHE REVERSE PROXY + MULTIPLE INTERNAL WEB SERVERS

 

There are two domains.  domain1 and domain2 both mapped to the internet
address inet_ip by dns.

 

The firewallServer located at inet_ip (internally this is internal_ip_4) has
iptables installed and running.

There is an iptables rule that redirects all traffic with a destination of
inet_ip:443 that is not part of an established connection to internal_ip_3

(not sure exactly how to write this yet.  Can anyone give a definitive
answer on whether it is possible and how?  If not, I'll look into it as time
permits)

Internal_ip_3 is running an apache server with name based virtual hosts and
reverse proxy rules set up to map domain1 to internal_ip_1 and domain2 to
internal_ip_2

Internal_ip_1 is running an apache server set up with SSL and a certificate
for domain1

Internal_ip_2 is running an apache server set up with SSL and a certificate
for domain2

 

 

I'm not sure if this is accurate, but I was thinking that if a client were
to make a request to https://www.domain1.com <https://www.domain1.com/> 

the initial packet would come into the firewall server and be routed to
internal_ip_3.

I was also thinking that at this point the connection has not yet been made
to the destination server so no encryption has actually been performed.

This would allow Apache to freely read the header information.

If this is correct, SSL shouldn't actually need to be installed on the
internal_ip_3 server and port 443 could be set up as a standard http server

 

OK, the above is one of the key points in this method of supporting SSL.
Please let me know if you know this won't work.

 

If the above is true, progress continues by the initial packet being routed
to the internal_ip_1 server.

This server has Apache set up with SSL and a certificate for domain1

The request is received and the handshake is performed.

Finally, the response from Apache on internal_ip_2 is encrypted with the
certificate for domain1 and returned to the client.

 

Further requests come in from client1 that are encrypted but due to the fact
that they are part of 

an established connection they are routed appropriately to the machine the
client previously connected to.

This is the second key question.  Will conntrack actual be able to do this
mapping with an encrypted packet.  If it can't the whole thing falls apart.

 

If this doesn't work exactly as is, would doing an SNAT when incoming
packets hit the firewallServer and the reverseProxy allow it to work?

 

Ok, that's that was my first attempt to design a solution.

 

 

 

next.

 

2.  ONE DOMAIN WITH SSL ENABLED THAT IS LEVERAGED FOR ALL LOGINS AND OTHER
SECURE REQUIREMENTS

 

I haven't worked out all of the details on this but it seems like it should
be pretty manageable

to have the site that needs secure services pass a site id and perhaps an
original URL to the secure site.

This should allow the secure site to brand the pages and fulfill secure
services with things like site specific user lists and redirects to the
referring page.

 

This seems like a pretty workable solution with the key drawbacks being some
confusion and potentially paranoia

on the part of the user due to the URL not being part of the original domain
and some additional coding and deployment complexity

due to the fact that the functionality of a "site" would really be split
across multiple domains.

With any luck,  proper branding could reduce the user confusion and proper
architecture and documentation would make it easier for developers to
implement.

 

OK, that's the second attempt.

 

 

 

I'd really appreciate any input anyone has.

 

Thanks,

 

 

 

 

Jeff

All the languages that the report mentioned are in use by Yahoo! and
Google - and these companies are more competent than Sun or Microsoft.
Can the report explain what they (Y! and Google) do not know that Sun

It appears that my problem stems from the Apache version that I'm running
(version 1.3.XX) - acceptpathinfo directive (e.g. look back) is only
supported in Apache 2.0.30 and above.  I thought I read somewhere that look
back had always been supported in Apache, but it appears that was just
wishful thinking.  If I'm mistaken, please feel free to correct me.

Thanks,

Cool, and probably too true. This is a place where Software priacy hurts economic interests; if small companies had to actually pay for the software they are using their choices might be more inclined to Free/Open Source. I know my clients are happy with using free software.  :)

Also, I wonder how many of us would be available to travel, or at least give talks about the free software that we use to groups who can't economically support a full fledged training program, etc? The thought of going someplace where these decisions are being made and telling them the options they have just seems too useful. Though I'm not an "Open Source or die!" sort of person I know open source software has so many advangates over the alternative it's easy to tell the truth and feel good about it.

One more reason to keep posting Phundamentals and white-papers...

ciao!

b) sort by or FILTER ONLY emails that have not gotten a response (from me or 
from the other party both filtering)
why? well... people ask me for info. i reply immediately. if they dont get 
the email, they think i didnt respond. they get upset. and generally my 
email is sitting in their spam filter. so.. i want a way to look for emails 
that have NOT been responded to for 3+ hours.
c) filter / forward based on time and # B, criteria
 do if / thens...
  _____________
****
 a) the way around the problem for me is to simply chance my subject lines 
BEFORE they get sent ... or Auto Generated from my formmail...
see http://evdo-coverage.com
 simple problem with gmail. all my conversations are bunched together EVEN 
IF they are unrelated ... simply due to subject line similarity.
 so.. i thought... instead of my FORMMAIL subject being the same " ! QUOTE 
REQUEST ! - New Client Contact !"
it could be...
 " ! QUOTE REQUEST ! <--! NAME and COMPANY FIELD VARIABLE GOES HERE-->- New 
Client Contact !"
 anybody know formmail perl????

Nah... can't be true. I only recently switched to 2.0 and I've been 
relying on combinations of FILE/Forcetype and apache's inherent 
directory walking for years.

Okay I took a look at Acceptpathnfo docs for v2 and I think I know what 
you mean. See the section of "default settings" because it reminds us 
that the default Apache HANDLER doesn't accept trailing string info on 
the resource name, but most SCRIPT handlers do (by default). Thus to use 
the default handler and get that railing info, you need this 
AcceptPathInfo stuff.

Since I use a FILES directive to set a php handler for my root scripts, 
the trailing info is present without that (i.e. in 1.3x).

guys...

 

Anybody know how to hack GMAIL so that

a) i can manually break up converstations. ****

b) sort by or FILTER ONLY emails that have not gotten a response (from me or
from the other party both filtering)

why? well... people ask me for info. i reply immediately. if they dont get
the email, they think i didnt respond. they get upset. and generally my
email is sitting in their spam filter. so.. i want a way to look for emails
that have NOT been responded to for 3+ hours. 

c) filter / forward based on time and # B, criteria

 

do if / thens...

 

 

_____________

****

a) the way around the problem for me is to simply chance my subject lines
BEFORE they get sent ... or Auto Generated from my formmail...

see http://evdo-coverage.com

 

simple problem with gmail. all my conversations are bunched together EVEN IF
they are unrelated ... simply due to subject line similarity.

 

so.. i thought... instead of my FORMMAIL subject being the same " ! QUOTE
REQUEST ! - New Client Contact !"
it could be...

 

" ! QUOTE REQUEST ! <--! NAME and COMPANY FIELD VARIABLE GOES HERE-->- New
Client Contact !"

 

anybody know formmail perl????

Don't use those. :-)

Those examples are meant to introduce some basic principles about state 
and session management in a generic way. The code is PHP, just because 
PHP is easy to read. It's not meant to be used by PHP developers, since 
the native session mechanism is much better.

This has all been a learning experience for me as i have never done anything 
with sessions aside from using PHP's default file based sessions.

I have posted my code for you experts to view so that maybe i can get some 
constructive criticism to make the code even better. Feel free to use this 
code in your applications if you feel you want to ;)

contractor.php - http://codebowl.dontexist.net/csaf/sessions/contractor.phps
admin.php - http://codebowl.dontexist.net/csaf/sessions/admin.phps

again i would like to get some suggestions, flames, whatever about my code, 
if you cant look at it now please look at it when you have some extra time 
;)

I have finally gotten everything to work (well almost). I have the session 
output showing all active sessions aside from your own session because the 
icon and page change was always one page refresh behind. However everything 
works perfect if i dont show the current users session info.

I would also like to thank all of those whom have contributed to this email 
and led my mind down roads which i may not have thought of right away ;) 
Thanks for all the help guys.

I think my next step is to implement a using function like you would see in 
.NET so that i can do 

using('lib.auth") and have it include all the files in that dir ;)

I was about to point this out, too. The data within $_ENV is going to be 
consistent, so it can't help you to identify inconsistencies in the 
client's requests.

That's not necessarily true. Judging something according to its strength 
as an identifier doesn't make a lot of sense in this context, either, 
and this is another remark I frequently observe.

The idea with these Defense in Depth mechanisms is to reduce the 
likelihood of session hijacking udner the condition that the session 
identifier has been captured. Every little thing helps.

A valid argument against user agent checking is that it can be 
inconsistent for the same user due to inconsistent HTTP proxy behavior. 
Thus, while it can help you identify inconsistencies, it's possible that 
some of these are false positives. These can be reduced somewhat by 
recording a user's history - someone with a consistent user agent for 
the last 100 requests is unlikely to send a different one in the same 
session, and a simple password prompt as "punishment" can make sure that 
any false positives don't piss off your legitimate users too much. :-)

Chris,

I appreciate your thoughts on the User Agent, maybe i will have to implement 
that type of tracking but i also think that if i compare the current user 
agent to an array of the last 100, wont that be time consuming and resource 
intensive.. that would get checked on every page load. I guess i could check 
it every X page loads but then again it wouldnt be a consistant check. I 
might have to check and see how much it would actually lag my site by doing 
that. I can imagine several thousand users doing that check every page load 
would not be that good ;)

You should discontinue this practice. It can adversely affect your 
legitimate users, and it's a trivial safeguard with negligible value.

Referer is sent by the client. Everyone on the planet knows exactly what 
you expect it to be. See the problem?

It would actually be better to make the client choose heads or tails - 
at least this can only be guessed correctly about 50% of the time 
instead of 100% of the time.

> Is not infalable but it adds an extra layer.

This general approach is a good one (it's called Defense in Depth), but 
try to pick a safeguard that has some value.

Hope that helps.

This is a tough one. The problem is that the session mechanism's write 
handler executes after the output stream has been closed. Many people 
run into this when trying to output debugging information to the screen 
- you'll never see the debugging info that your write handler outputs.

Hope that helps.

Chris,

thanks for the answer to that.. I had struggled with that for days before i 
realised what it was. I continued to get the error and in most cases it was 
my database object throwing an exception due to a bad query format.

It's not a particularly good example, since an attacker can pretty 
easily determine the format of the cookie string and spoof it.

However, it's meant to illustrate the basic idea of consistency 
checking. Inconsistencies in a client's request are reason for 
suspicion, although legitimate users may send slightly inconsistent 
requests due to HTTP proxies and weird browser behavior (IE sends a 
different Accept header when you reload a page) on occasion. So, make 
sure your "punishment" is mild. :-)

Hope that helps.

George is the performance guy. :-)

Yes, any safeguard is going to cost you some performance. I think this 
is fine as long as long as the negative impact of a safeguard has a 
linear correlation to your traffic. Exponential costs will kill you.

For example, in this case, you could check against each user agent sent 
in the past requests for the current session, and this would be awful. 
Every time a user requests a page, the performance impact is higher than 
it was for the previous requests, because the cost is accumulating.

A better approach would be to check an integer - whenever a user agent 
matches, you increment a counter. After a certain threshhold of your 
choosing, you can begin enforcing user agent consistency. Checking to 
see whether 7919 is greater than 50 is comparable to checking to see 
whether 100 is greater than 50. Thus, while the safeguard has a 
performance cost, it's a consistent one.

Hope that helps.

Chris,

yet again someone shows me a method of doing something that i was not 
thinking about ;)

thanks if i implement this i will be doing it this way, basically storing 
the last 10 UA's and checking those, once one is found that doesnt match it 
increments a count. The count hits a certain # the session is destroyed, is 
that what you meant?

I would store one user agent and increment a counter whenever a match is 
found (not the other way around). Once that counter passes a certain 
threshhold of your choosing, enforce user agent consistency.

I would reset the counter when a match is not found, otherwise the 
purpose is lost.

This is a pretty extreme reaction. A better approach is to prompt the 
user for a password. After all, this approach isn't foolproof, and 
neither is the implementation. There are situations (weird browser 
behavior, HTTP proxies, errors in your code, etc.) that can cause a 
legitimate user to fail one of your checks.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Chris,

I think i see your point about not destroying the session. I should just ask 
for thier password, if it matches let them continue on, if not maybe allow 3 
attempts and then destroy the session.

if you are incrementing on a valid match of the UA, are you saying to stop 
checking once they hit a threshold of say 50 checks?

I'm saying to start enforcing the checking at that point. :-)

This whole idea of recording history is just to increase the reliability 
of the approach - it's not necessary, but you're otherwise more likely 
to ask a legitimate user to provide the password again.

This same approach can be used for more than just user agent - the idea 
is to identify things that are consistent in requests from your 
legitimate users, then you can identify inconsistencies as a reason for 
suspicion.

Hope that helps.

Jeff-
 
I looked into this a while back and came to the conclusion that you have to
have different IP address or do it with the application logic.  I'm no
expert, so would be interested if someone knows of a solution.
 
A couple of comments found from the Internet:
- "Name-based virtual hosting cannot be used with SSL secure servers because
of the nature of the SSL protocol."
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/vhosts/name-based.html#using).
-  Another site said "...when using SSL, all HTTP traffic is encrypted, and
this includes the request's Host: header. This header is unavailable until
the SSL handshake has been performed, and that in turn requires that the
request has been dispatched to the appropriate virtual host, because the SSL
handshake depends on that particular host's SSL certificate. For this
reason, each SSL-enabled virtual host needs its own, unique IP address. You
can still use name-based virtual hosts along with SSL-enabled virtual hosts
in the same configuration file, though."
 
-Pat

Hi all,

 

I have multiple domains but only a single IP address and I'd like to support
encrypted connections for certain operations like login, credit card info,
secure file upload and download, etc.  I've heard a lot about how SSL can't
be used with name based virtual hosting but I'm still looking for a solution
that does not force me to set up a separate IP for each domain that has
needs for secure operations.  I've had a couple of ideas that I think might
work but I'd like a few other smart folks to bounce the idea off if
possible.

 

 

 

1.  IPTABLES + APACHE REVERSE PROXY + MULTIPLE INTERNAL WEB SERVERS

 

There are two domains.  domain1 and domain2 both mapped to the internet
address inet_ip by dns.

 

The firewallServer located at inet_ip (internally this is internal_ip_4) has
iptables installed and running.

There is an iptables rule that redirects all traffic with a destination of
inet_ip:443 that is not part of an established connection to internal_ip_3

(not sure exactly how to write this yet.  Can anyone give a definitive
answer on whether it is possible and how?  If not, I'll look into it as time
permits)

Internal_ip_3 is running an apache server with name based virtual hosts and
reverse proxy rules set up to map domain1 to internal_ip_1 and domain2 to
internal_ip_2

Internal_ip_1 is running an apache server set up with SSL and a certificate
for domain1

Internal_ip_2 is running an apache server set up with SSL and a certificate
for domain2

 

 

I'm not sure if this is accurate, but I was thinking that if a client were
to make a request to https://www.domain1.com <https://www.domain1.com/> 

the initial packet would come into the firewall server and be routed to
internal_ip_3.

I was also thinking that at this point the connection has not yet been made
to the destination server so no encryption has actually been performed.

This would allow Apache to freely read the header information.

If this is correct, SSL shouldn't actually need to be installed on the
internal_ip_3 server and port 443 could be set up as a standard http server

 

OK, the above is one of the key points in this method of supporting SSL.
Please let me know if you know this won't work.

 

If the above is true, progress continues by the initial packet being routed
to the internal_ip_1 server.

This server has Apache set up with SSL and a certificate for domain1

The request is received and the handshake is performed.

Finally, the response from Apache on internal_ip_2 is encrypted with the
certificate for domain1 and returned to the client.

 

Further requests come in from client1 that are encrypted but due to the fact
that they are part of 

an established connection they are routed appropriately to the machine the
client previously connected to.

This is the second key question.  Will conntrack actual be able to do this
mapping with an encrypted packet.  If it can't the whole thing falls apart.

 

If this doesn't work exactly as is, would doing an SNAT when incoming
packets hit the firewallServer and the reverseProxy allow it to work?

 

Ok, that's that was my first attempt to design a solution.

 

 

 

next.

 

2.  ONE DOMAIN WITH SSL ENABLED THAT IS LEVERAGED FOR ALL LOGINS AND OTHER
SECURE REQUIREMENTS

 

I haven't worked out all of the details on this but it seems like it should
be pretty manageable

to have the site that needs secure services pass a site id and perhaps an
original URL to the secure site.

This should allow the secure site to brand the pages and fulfill secure
services with things like site specific user lists and redirects to the
referring page.

 

This seems like a pretty workable solution with the key drawbacks being some
confusion and potentially paranoia

on the part of the user due to the URL not being part of the original domain
and some additional coding and deployment complexity

due to the fact that the functionality of a "site" would really be split
across multiple domains.

With any luck,  proper branding could reduce the user confusion and proper
architecture and documentation would make it easier for developers to
implement.

 

OK, that's the second attempt.

 

 

 

I'd really appreciate any input anyone has.

 

Thanks,

 

 

 

 

Jeff

Chris,

so what you are suggesting is that i grab the users UA every page load, once 
i have 50 of them compare them to see how many i have that are not 
consistant? I think you confused me there lol.

Not at all.

1. Record the user agent. This is just a string, and you can record the 
MD5 of it to give yourself a consistent format and size (and eliminate 
some injection concerns).

2. Upon each visit, you'll have a conditional statement that compares 
the user agent in the current request with the one you recorded. If they 
are the same, increment the counter. If they are different, reset the 
counter (and perhaps record the new user agent).

3. If the counter passes a threshhold of your choosing, enforce the 
consistency check by prompting for a password when the user agents don't 
match.

Something like that - you shouldn't be recording a bunch of user agents 
and doing lots of comparisons.

Chris, Patrick,

Thanks for the feedback.  I thought the first idea probably wouldn't work
due to the encryption of the header but I wanted to get some other opinions.

Has anyone worked on a solution that had a single domain serving the SSL
requests, authentication, credit card authorization, etc for multiple
domains?

Thanks,



Jeff

I wrote a little about this here:

http://shiflett.org/books/http-developers-handbook/chapters/18

There is a section on virtual hosting.

I thought that one of the main points of
http://shiflett.org/code/http-developers-handbook/session_example.phps --
though it's for demo purposes only -- is the technique of re-writing all
your URLs to include a token as a secondary identifier in addition to the
session id so that an attacker has to steal both in order to succeed.

Do the solutions you're playing also with work that way, or just by
storing extra stuff in the session to compare with the current request?

Also, isn't there a more than negligible chance that an attacker could be
using the same UA as the victim?

Message-ID: <8d9a42800508080929656f42a@mail.gmail.com>

the way i currently have it is like this

define('SES_KEY', md5('CUSTOM_STRING'));

$key = 
md5($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].SES_KEY.session_id().$data['ses_start']);
$key = str_mix($key, SES_KEY);

this will create a key 64 chars long. i needed a way to have it mix the 
strings but mix them the same way every time so str_shuffle would not work 
for me. I created the following function which just takes the first char 
from str1 and str2 and combines like so

str1_1.str2_1.str1_2.str2_2.str1_3.str2_3, etc..

function str_mix($str1, $str2) {
if(strlen($str1) != strlen($str2)) return FALSE;
else {
$len1 = strlen($str1) - 1;
$string = '';
for($x = 0; $x <= $len1; $x++) {
$string .= $str1{$x}.$str2{$x};
}
return $string;
}
}

i take this string and store it in the database next to the session_id. 
Every page load i create this string based on my custom string and the user 
info, and then i compare it with the one in the database. if they match 
everything is ok, if not, something is wrong.

Well I knew I was doing a poor job before, but this session discussion has 
finally brought me to finally design a new system. However, I think in order 
to prevent against something, you need to first learn how it works, which is 
why I write. What is session hijacking, and how do you do it? I'm currently 
designing a new site where security is very important, and I feel the need 
to go fully into this. If anyone could explain, or point me to some articles 
( can't really afford books at the moment, about to leave for college and 
don't really have that much money ) I would greatly appreciate this. Thank 
you.

Message-ID: <8d9a42800508081237245aa62@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Guys,

i am working on a database class however i am not getting the expected 
results.

<?php
using("System.Database.Drivers");
class Database {

public function __construct($dsn = 'mysql://csaf:bose343 at localhost/csaf', 
$persistant = false) {
$d = explode(':', $dsn);
$driver = ucfirst(strtolower($d[0]));
if(isset($driver)) {
if(isset($dsn)) return new $driver($dsn, $persistant);
else throw new DatabaseEx('Invalid DSN'); 
}
else throw new DatabaseEx('Invalid Driver!');
}
}

$dsn = "mysql://user:pass at localhost/csaf";
$db = new Database($dsn);
$db->Open();
$res = $db->Query("SELECT username FROM admins WHERE id=1");
$data = $db->FetchArray($res);
$db->Close();
print_r($data);
?>

i get the follwing error with that code.

*Fatal error*: Call to undefined method Database::Open() in *
E:\htdocs\csaf1\global.php* on line *156*

if i do 
if($db instanceof Mysql) echo "YAY"; 
it never echo's but if i change Mysql to Database it will echo.
Any help / explanation would be appreciated.

You're calling a method of Database that doesn't exist, hence the
error "Call to undefined method. You define the class Database, but it
has no Open(), Query(), FetchArray() or Close() methods defined. If
you want it to inherit methods from some base class, you're going to
need to define your class doing something like:
class Database extends BaseClass {
}

what is this using() function at the top? Is that a user defined
function that does a require on a file in the path?

ps... I hope that's not your actual user/pass pasted in the code... if
so I would change it now that it has been shared with a bunch of
strangers.

Speaking of which I also noticed your constructor returned things. I
thought that constructors implicitly return an instance of their class and
nothing else -- that is, they can succeed and return a class instance,
throw an exception, or die. But maybe I am mistaken and should go back to
the books.

David,

you were correct i could not have the constructore return a class like i was 
trying to do, rather i created a static method GetDriver that i am using to 
have the driver returned.

Basics of sessions:

1) User logs in providing something he knows (username, password)
2) You assign (cookie) the browser with a long random string.  You record 
the string in a datastore on the server.
3) Anytime you get hits from a browser which presents the long random string 
that's in your datastore, you can assume it's the same user - therefore you 
need not ask for the username/password again.  Also, you know what the user 
did last - you can keep state across requests.
4) If time passes without access, you might delete the long random string in 
your datastore, rendering the browser's credentials invalid and requiring 
the user to log in again.

Good points:

1) User doesn't have to log in for each page.

Bad points:

1) If someone obtained the long random string, it would be like obtaining 
the user's username and password.  Bad person's browser could present the 
long random string...

Ways to hijack a session:

1) Eavesdrop on the user's datastream.  By default, all of this is in plain 
text, including the initial sending of the username and password.  
Solution: use HTTPS.

2) Find a way to insert javascript on YOUR website that accesses the cookies 
the user is sending and resends them to BAD_WEBSITE.  This is called 
cross-site-scripting, or XSS.  Solution: design your website to not echo 
any user input back to the user without sanitizing it.  Many, MANY sites 
are vulnerable to this.  The only upside is that usually XSS attacks have 
to be customized for the site they are attacking - someone has to want to 
attack YOUR site, not just any site.  The motivation for doing so is as 
valuable or as non-valuable as the accounts on your website are (so many of 
the vulnerable sites don't really need to care).  Read up on XSS.

3) If your session id's are being maintained in the user's URLs rather than 
user cookies, an attacked just has to get the user to follow a link to 
BAD_WEBSITE, then the session id will show up in the HTTP_REFERER variable.  
Solution: cookies are much preferred over URL-variable sessions.

4) Hack your server.  Solution: Don't let them hack your server.

5) Come along shortly after a user and use the same web browser he did.  
Solution: limit session length, warn users about logging in from public 
workstations, use session cookies that are deleted when the browser is 
closed, etc.

Miscellaneous:

1) Some people store state info in the cookies themselves, where the user 
can get at and modify them.  I prefer storing it serverside.  For 
unimportant state info, like a user's choice of language for a site, it 
doesn't matter.  For important state info, serverside is the only choice.

2) PHP's session info is stored in text files on the server.  I prefer 
sessions that are stored in a real database.  For small sites, it doesn't 
matter.  For large sites, database is the only real choice.

3) Keep in mind that PHP's built-in session-handling is one implementation 
of the idea of "sessions", and not necessarily a good one for you.  You can 
write a PHP app that does sessions, and does them very well, without using 
any of PHP's session-handling functions.

4) Storing and verifying other info about the user (such as their IP 
address, user-agent string, or what-have-you) is effectively requiring the 
user to present more than just the long random string to validate his 
session.  Your sessions will break if you require something to be static 
(i.e., IP address) that actually isn't (AOL users behind an array of 
proxies).  Also, if the attacker can steal the long random string, he can 
just as well get the browser user-agent, etc. etc.

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0508091703410.222@emra.pair.com>


Inside my intranet I have (or had) passwordless SSH keys set up so I could
ssh into the machines I administer with an absolute minimum of pain. I
followed the instructions found on some how-to out there, and it worked
fine for a long time.

Today I replaced a failing drive in one of the machines, the drive that
housed the /home partition. Put in new drive, partitioned it, etc.,
restored data from a tarball. SSH keys stopped working. The drive
replacement event is the only difference between Before and After that I
can think of.

The offending box is called interps1. In my .ssh directory on my desktop,
I have:

[david at mintz ~]$ ls -l .ssh
total 28
-rw-------  1 david david  887 Aug  9 15:18 identity
-rw-------  1 david david  887 Apr  8 14:39 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  1 david david  240 Apr  8 14:39 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 david david 2762 Jun 30 11:00 known_hosts

The id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files where created with ssh-keygen back in
April. There's another box called interps2 where I have my .ssh with that
very same id_rsa.pub appended to my authorized_keys; passwordless SSH
logins work fine from my desktop to that machine. I can also
passwordlessly SSH into all the other machines to which I've copied my
public key; that is, nothing has changed except with this interps1.

So I started over from scratch with my .ssh directory on interps1, that
is, I appended my id_rsa.pub (from my desktop) to .ssh/authorized_keys (on
interps1) and tried again to ssh. Still I get prompted for password. I
tried it with -v for verbosity and it doesn't seem to tell me anything I
don't already know (i.e., it ain't working).

I tried several other silly things as well but I don't want to bore you
(too much).

All three machines are running Fedora Core 3 and OpenSSH_3.9p1, OpenSSL
0.9.7a

Any ideas what I could be doing wrong?

A million thanks,

Any Spreadsheet/Excel/Writer.php experts out there?  I'm trying to paste
bitmaps into spreadsheet cells via insertBitmap.  The images appear without
a hitch, I'm just not able to adjust the size of the cell (either via the
insertBitmap parameters or setColumn/setRow).

If anyone can point me to [better] documentation [than PEAR's], or has some
words of wisdom they can share....

TIA,

Documentation for Spreadsheet::Excel is sparse, I'm afraid, and the 
library is quirky enough that I wrote an API wrapper for it so I 
wouldn't have to remember all the gyrations I needed to use to generate 
a boilerplate report.  Unfortunately I can't share it because my client 
considers it a trade secret.

IIRC, setColumn() needs to be called to size the cells before any data 
is written to the worksheet, if that's any help.  I've only used images 
to brand spreadsheets with client logos, always at 0,0.  But I seem to 
remember that bitmaps tend to float over the spreadsheet anyway.  That 
is, they're not bound by cells.

Do not keep it password-less - do have a look at ssh-agent

Have a look at /var/log/messages on both the machines when you ssh.
That should give you more hints.

Make sure the authorized_keys file is readable only by you.  When you
do an "ls -l" on the file, you should see something like this:

-rw-------  1 cmerlo cmerlo 605 2005-08-09 23:04 .ssh/authorized_keys

Steve,

You were correct, setColumn() needs to be called to size the cells before
any data is written to the worksheet.  Now the $M question....anyone know
what the units are in setColumn?  Definitely not pixels.  Maybe a conversion
ratio?

Did you try '-vv' or '-vvv' ?

Also you might try editing
#SyslogFacility AUTH
#LogLevel INFO
in the sshd_config

D'OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Just 20 seconds ago I figured that out and then checked
my nyphp mail hoping it wasn't too late to say nevermind.

Thank you.

One of the hardest things to learn is when to get up and walk away. I
walked out in digust yesterday, came back fresh today and solved it in
literally under a minute. RTFM turned out to be fundamental once again.

As for the passwordlessness, yes of course you're right. Problem is there
are some things cron does over ssh from here to other machines out there
(outside out intranet) and I haven't figured out how to do them with --
pardon them expression? -- nonpasswordless keys. I have read somewhere
about ways to limit the command set that can be executed on the remote
server, shoulda bookmarked that page.

Thank you again,

	David

Just curious, would this error be picked up in some log file
somewhere, there are probably a dozen or more scattered about.  Not
sure if this one would have been detected, but who knows?

I was always told: "Grasshopper, all is there, watch your breath, your

Thanks for the information, was greatly helpful.

I have a question about the basics of sessions you listed though - you say 
that you provide the user with a cookie that contains a long string; what if 
they don't allow cookies? are you referring to the session as a cookie?

And I have a question about my current system:
As of right now, I create 3 sessions for each user: userID, user, and pass 
(md5 of it, I never directly deal with the user's password). The reason I 
think my current system is poor is because I trust the session, and I only 
check the 'userID' session for authentication. So for instance, if the 
userID is mine (ie, 16), and that userid has access to certain areas of the 
website, I allow it, without any further checks.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's safe, but it's the system I created 
before I knew much about how php worked, so I didn't really know any better, 
which is why I'm trying to create a more secure system.

man sshd. :) I use the command parameter quite a bit for passwordless
keys. You simply have 'command=whatever' at the beginning of the key
in authorized_keys. Most of what I use it for is rsync backups from a
certain machine.

Very good questions. You might be interested in the lecture notes I wrote
up for an introductory php course:

The cookie *is* the provided mechanism for maintaining state.  To me, 
questions about maintaining state when the user has disabled cookies are 
like questions about how to display the color red when the user has pulled 
the red gun out of his monitor.

You can try to maintain state in other ways, such as appending a GET 
variable to every URL.  This is a poor substitute for cookies (and if the 
user is that concerned about tracking, they should manually delete that GET 
variable anyway, thwarting you.)  If you *need* sessions, require cookies.

I think your terminology is a little confused.  Remember that PHP's built-in 
functions are just one specific way to handle the generic idea of 
state-tracking.  PHP uses a PHPSESSID for its long string.  This is 
"behind-the-scenes" to you - you never explicitly assign it - if you're 
using the built-in functions.  You could create and assign and use your own 
long random string and write your own session-handling code if you wished.

That is, your browser is sending PHPSESSID (not 'userID'), and PHP is 
automagically seeking a session file with that name on disk, and retrieving 
your 'userID' variable from that file, and making it available to the rest 
of the PHP script.  Assuming that PHPSESSIDs are random and long enough to 
be unguessable, this isn't a security flaw.

Can anyone here tell me how to make my useragent change when using mozilla 
firefox?

The reason i ask is because i am working on a session class that will count 
how many times a users agent changes, if they hit a max limit it will ask 
the user for thier password again for security. The issue i am going to hit 
is not knowing how to change my UA so that i can test to make sure the 
functionality works.

In FF address bar, type "about:config" to access the configuration
area.  Right click anywhere, choose "new" and add a "String".

Enter the Preference Name to be "general.useragent.override" and use
whatever value you wish.

Also, I found this: http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/useragentswitcher 
not sure how good it is though.

Do you mean you're setting three cookies?  Don't.

Don't set any cookies manually.  Let PHP's session_start() do it for you.

Then, to save data in the session, save it like this:

    $_SESSION['username'] = 'foo';

That saves it on the server, which is the whole point of sessions.

I don't use cookies for that. I use $_SESSION['userID'], $_SESSION['user'], 
$_SESSION['pass'].

I understand the concept of sessions, I don't understand the concept of 
hijacking them, and making a system to prevent hijacking them.

One way to hijack a session is to hack in, compromise a machine on the 
network and run a sniffer. Most hackers are not running sniffers to 
hijack sessions though. They sniff to grab login/passwords from 
pop/imap/smtp/ftp/telnet. Requiring  SSL/TLS protects you from this attack.

Another way to hijack sessions is to find websites that still append the 
session data to the url and links. The *friendfinder.com sites and 
several others, which I shall not mention, maintain sessions like that. 
I believe if you disable cookies in your browser, PHP reverts to url 
based sessions*.

Ok, so here's basically how it works: You find a php website which uses 
session cookies and allows you to post messages/stuff (eg. your dating 
profile). In your dating profile, you include some stuff about yourself 
"bla bla bla"... then add <img 
src="http://yourownwebsite.com/blankpixel.gif">

Then site back and wait.

Every now and then, grep your web server logs for "blankpixel.gif". The 
referer field in the log will list the referring url... which contains 
the appended session cookie. At this point, you can just copy+paste the 
referer url into your browser, click "GO" an assume the identity of the 
person who viewed your dating profile. For this reason, passing session 
id's via GET requests are extremely dangerous.

* safest thing to do is "enable session.use_only_cookies" and require 
that clients have cookies enabled.... and use https

Chris,

the current way i have things working is like this.

On the first page load set $_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
On the next page load compare the agents.
If they dont match increment the counter
otherwise continue on as normal

Once the counter hit's a limit of say 3 it shows the password box and tells 
the user they need to verify they are the same user. If they enter the 
correct password, everything is reset, otherwise a password check counter is 
incremented. If they enter the password wrong 3 times the system will 
destroy the session and assume it's not the correct user.

My questions is, did i get a clear understanding of what you were saying to 
do and did i implement this the proper way according to your thoughts?

Joseph,

 From my understanding this is the opposite of what Chris was 
suggesting, because it does not adapt to usage patterns.

On the first page load set $_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
Also set $_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT_MATCHES'] = 1
On each page load, if the user agent matches what is stored, increment 
$_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT_MATCHES'] by 1
If the user agent does not match, and the count of matching agents is 
greater than some threshold, then prompt for a password.

The idea is to protect people whose user agent does not change often 
without unduly penalising people whose user agent does (for whatever 
reason).

The fact that the system 'learns' from the activity of the user to offer 
the best balance between security and convenience is what sets a system 
like this apart from the majority of rigid systems.

It occurs to me that this would be a good structure to generalise and 
implement in an extensible class, as it can (and should) really be 
applied to many different security tasks.

I think you're still missing part of how php sessions work.

The default is for sessions to use a cookie.  When a new session is 
started a cookie is sent to the user that contains the unique session 
name.  All other session variables are stored on the server.  When going 
to a new page, the session name in the cookie is compared to the session 
name on the server.  If they match, OK, things continue.

If you don't want to use a cookie you can pass the session name along in 
the URL using the PHPSESSID constant.  I believe that this is not 
recommended as it is very transparent.

Also, in your example you are not creating three different sessions. 
You are creating one session and storing three different variables in 
that session.

I believe that if you want to get more in depth about preventing 
sessions from being hijacked, that is when you get into writing your own 
session functions/classes (see the other ongoing sessions thread).

I'm just a newbie of sorts myself, so I'm hoping the gurus will correct 
me if I have inaccuracies here.

hth,

-Aaron

Dan is exactly right, and this is a good explanation of the reasoning:

Enforcing consistency isn't a perfect solution, but if you can make 
things a bit harder for the bad guys without adversely affecting your 
good guys, it's a step in the right direction. :-)

That seems a bit backwards to me.

If thier User Agent doesnt change and it hit's my threshold why should i 
prompt for a password? If thier user agent continuously changes they will 
never get prompted for the password. Isnt the idea to promp for the password 
if thier user agent changes often?

I guess i am not understanding why it would work like this

user hits the page User Agent stored
user hits again User Agent Compared
If they match increment counter

When counter hits threshold prompt for password.

Joseph,

To understand the approach you need to take a step back and look at the 
bigger picture of what we're trying to achieve.

Say we have a client who always uses the same browser, and all of a 
sudden you get a request that comes from a different browser.  This does 
not fit the profile, and so we should prompt for a password because it 
is likely to be an attacker.

If you have a client who for whatever reason changes their user agent 
string all the time, you don't want to enforce the user agent check 
because it will just annoy them, and probably lose you the client.

So, you keep track of the user agent to see which the client in question 
is.  If you are dealing with the former, enforce the check because it 
will increase their security, otherwise use a different check.

The counter is there to determine which category the client in question 
falls into, so when their user agent hasn't changed for some number of 
page loads you assume they fall into the first category and enforce the 
check.

This same approach could also be very powerful when applied to IP 
address checking, to provide protection for clients whose IP does not 
change often, without affecting those who do.

ahh so you are only saying to prompt for the passwoird if they are over the 
threshold AND thier user agent changes, i understood it as everytime they 
hit the threshold to prompt. That makes a bit more sense, however for 
someone who's UA changes frequently they wont ever get prompted for thier 
password. What would you suggest to ensure thier security?

I like Dan's answer here very much.
Rule based security is the only way intrusion detection, like preventing 
session hijacking, works effectively. And for further example - spam 
filtering, in addition to regular expressions, neural networks are even 
used because there is no one rule that works.

I would also note that if a client hits more than 3-6 times a second, 
especially on a login, that something is wierd.
I store these kinds of things in a MySQL hashtable.

I understand what you are saying about if a users UA doesnt change often 
then all the sudden there is a change, this is not normal so i should 
enforce the check. However for the users that for whatever reason thier UA 
changes frequently what else could i check? Thier IP may change frequently 
as well so i cannot base the second check on that alone. Maybe i should 
integrate the IP checking in with the UA checking, and if thier UA changes 
frequently but thier ip does not, check the ip, if changed that's not 
normal, show the login. However what if it is an AOL user tunneling in 
through a proxy and for whatever reason thier UA changes frequently, thier 
IP could change from page to page as AOL tunnels through proxies.

I guess i need to know what to do if the users UA and IP both change 
frequently, should i just ignore them and hope they dont have thier session 
hijacked? I understand what i am implementing should secure atleast 90% of 
users but what about the other 10%

Guys here is my current CheckSession function code, can you critique it for 
me please ;)
basically it checks to see if the users user agent changes, if it does it 
checks to see if it normally changes frequently, if it does it should do 
nothing, if it doesnt change frequently and it has changed, it then checks 
to see if the users ip address has changed. If both the UA and IP have 
changed and it's abnormal for the users UA to change it requests the 
passord. I have yet to add this functionality but plan to

If the users UA does change frequently it will check to see if the users IP 
changes frequently if not and it has infact changed it will display the 
password page, otherwise it will keep on chugging and realise this is one of 
the say 10% users who's UA and IP changes frequently.


function CheckSession() {
global $db;
// check the users user agent activity.
if(isset($_POST['submit'])) {
if(isset($_POST['passwd'])) {
$table = strtolower($_SESSION['type'].'s');
$res = $db->Query("SELECT pass FROM ".$table." WHERE 
username='".$_SESSION['username']."' AND pass='".md5($_POST['passwd'])."'");
if($db->NumRows($res) == 0) {
$pError = 'Invalid Password!';
// display password form 
// displayPasswordForm($pError);
} else {
// reset our session variables.
unset($_SESSION['UA_CHECKS']);
unset($_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
unset($_SESSION['UA_CHANGES']);
}
} else {
// displayPasswordForm($pError);
}
}
if($_SESSION['UA_CHECKS'] >= UA_THRESHOLD) {
}

// check to see if UA_CHECKS is instanciated, if not set it to 0
if(!isset($_SESSION['UA_CHECKS'])) $_SESSION['UA_CHECKS'] = 0;
// check to see if the users IP address has been set, if not set it.
if(!isset($_SESSION['REMOTE_ADDR'])) $_SESSION['REMOTE_ADDR'] = 
$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

// check to see if the IP has changed
if($_SESSION['REMOTE_ADDR'] != $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) {
// It has changed, update and increment IP_CHANGES count
$_SESSION['REMOTE_ADDR'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
++$_SESSION['IP_CHANGES'];
}

if(!isset($_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) $_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] = 
$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
else {
// check to see if the UA has changed
if($_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] != $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']) {
// Check to see if the UA_CHECKS has been completed UA_THRESHOLD times
if($_SESSION['UA_CHECKS'] >= UA_THRESHOLD) {
// It's not normal for the users UA to change frequently
// check to see if the IP has changed at all
if($_SESSION['IP_CHANGES'] != 0) {
// The users IP changed also, display the password page.
//display the password page
}
// UA_CHECKS has not met with UA_THRESHOLD increment the UA_CHANGES
} else {
if(!isset($_SESSION['UA_CHANGES'])) $_SESSION['UA_CHANGES'] = 0;
++$_SESSION['UA_CHANGES'];
}

} else {
++$_SESSION['UA_CHECKS'];
}
}
}

He asked if I was setting the information in a cookie, or by using 
$_SESSION, so I told him.

Do you mean you're setting three cookies? Don't.

Don't set any cookies manually. Let PHP's session_start() do it for you.

Then, to save data in the session, save it like this:

$_SESSION['username'] = 'foo';

That saves it on the server, which is the whole point of sessions.

--Dan

I understand that I'm not creating 3 different sessions, was just my 
terminology that I misused.

So what you're saying is if I see a "?PHPSESSID=xxxxxxxxxxxx" in the URL of 
my site, than it is vulnerable?

I think this is a great discussion and very worthwhile, and some of 
these explanations should be very enlightening. However, we need to be 
aware of the problems associated with one of the "80/20 rules" (which 
these approaches "seem" to endorse). (satisfy 80% of the market and 
don't worry about the other non-mainstream 20%).

* Let's not forget that vulnerability usually comes from lazy or 
incomplete coding. When corners are cut (for whatever reasons, with 
whatever validity), vulnerabilities are left in place.After reading this 
thread I can imagine coders carefuly coding so those with static IPs and 
static user agents get standard auth and those who vary get trapped by 
extra security checkpoints that are little more than re-checks of the 
same credentials. Sure, as the argument goes, there may be more risk so 
why not re-check.

* Let's just make sure that you are testing your code well enough that 
your 20% are properly managed (chances are your dev machines will rarely 
go through the extra checks and if they do, you'll probably bypass it 
for convenience).
Let's also make sure we aren't inconveniencing the most important market 
segment in that 20% -- I know some of my privacy websites would fail 
miserably if this sort of "extra security" were deployed.
Once you start inspecting UA, you get into the browser standards world - 
plenty of browser/extension combinations mess with the UA or block it 
altogether. As already stated many times, proxies wreak havoc with IPs 
and UA strings.

 From a user-friendliness perspective, there is little more annoying to 
me than a definitive but erroneous statement from an error message or 
security check (like when I have cookies ENABLED and I get a message 
"Your browser does not accept cookies...please turn them on and try 
again").

Personally I prefer the concept of "translucent data", although I 
recognize it is not for everyone. Start with

Also check the .ssh directory itself itself can only be seen by you.
Spent almost two hours trying to troubleshoot an SSH problem... and it was

I'll be giving September's talk and wanted to offer a few possibilities 
to see what people are interested in hearing - if anything. :-) The talk 
I give doesn't have to be an existing talk but can be a medley of topics 
of your choosing, so feel free to mix and match or suggest specific 
areas of interest.

1. PHP Security Briefing
    Beginner/Lecture
    60 Minutes

2. PHP Security Audit HOWTO
    Intermediate/Lecture
    60 Minutes

The first is a general talk covering many bases, including best 
practices, common vulnerabilities, and popular attacks. The second is a 
more specific talk that describes the art of the PHP security audit, 
including tips that I've picked up over the last few years.

Other topics I can speak on include HTTP, state, and sessions, although 
these tend to be a bit less exciting. :-)

Recently found out my job contract will be winding down and have been

I have a couple leads, but was wondering if anyone has any tips for this

I made a post on craigslist:

Which had a couple bites and has one interview pending..
But figured I would ask here as many of you guys work in PHP shops.

Thanks

Subject: [nycphp-talk] somewhat OT: open source code auditing
Message-ID: <42FD0CD0.8050705@supertom.com>

Hey Folks,

This is slightly off-topic, but I've just had the "higher-ups" come to 
me asking about open source and coding audits.  I'm not speaking about 
collaborative tools or auditing from a security perspective, but rather 
from a legal perspective.  Simply put, how do you know were a piece of 
code really came from?

I'm hoping that others on the list have gone through this (or are 
actually going through it now) and can provide some insight. 

Some general questions:
1. When you decide to use a piece of open source software, what do you 
document? (package name, authors, download location, website, license, 
date/time, etc)
2.  Do you feel the need to actually verify that they wrote it?  Or is 
it enough to say, "This is a popular package, and it is generally 
accepted that this person wrote it."

As this could relate to PHP:
1.  The PEAR and PECL repositories - is there anything built into the 
package approval process that looks for this?  I didn't see anything on 
the website.  I would imagine that some Google searches probably occur 
just to make sure this package
2. Code posted on the PHP site by users?  Is that "free" to use?

I realize that most of us aren't lawyers, and we're getting help from 
our legal team, but any help you can provide is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom

There's a very active thread on the PHP internals list regarding major 
changes to PHP as suggested by Rasmus for version 6.

Here's the original post, along with many, many replies supporting the 
suggestions to varying degrees:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-dev&m=112386891931477&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112386908300002&r=1&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112387117900002&r=1&w=2

I'm not a language-itself-PHP-developer, but some of these things seem 
quite radical (hence the version number, of course) for the end programmer 
(mainly points 7 and 8, which are admittedly considered lower profile). 
Thoughts on the proposed changes?  Anything you might add yourself?

What does $file (and/or $data) look like?

The only weird thing I see below is the escaping of the quotes.in the  
xml and rss versions.

I caught your "Audit How To" talk in Vancouver and it was very good, 
thanks. I know the NYPHP audience would appreciate that one.

If you also showed how past FOSS PHP alerts (such as those listed by 
Secunia) fit the models, and thus could have been detectred by the audit 
process, that would push it over the top quality-wise.

The PHP Security Audit HOWTO sounds really interesting.

I disagree that something with sessions wouldn't be all that 
interesting, though.  Of course you'd have to put a new twist on it... 
instead of the same old custom storage of session data in a MySQL 
database, perhaps store them in an IMAP mailbox, shared memory segment, 
"duplexing" session tracking data to an audit printer in real time, 
etc.  I dunno, maybe it's just late and I need some sleep.

With all the buzz and focus on 5, I totally forgot the development cycle 
continues!  Woops!

Like Chris, I'm optimistic about PHP's future, too... I definately like 
the idea of removing register_globals.  I think the whole namespace 
thing (if implemented correctly) would be another big selling point; I 
hop that one can gain some support.  Honestly, it would be nice too to 
have all the string functions have a consistant needle/haystack order as 
someone suggested too (it really is quite irksome), but I know that's 
too much to ask for.

i used to think we needed a 'throws' keyword for methods.
As I tried to formulate my email, I changed my mind.

I'm no language architect, but it seems to me that in Java you define a 
method and let others know that it may throw a certain type of 
exception.
That way they know in advance and MUST handle it or it won't compile.
But  since we are not compiling, I guess all possible exceptions should 
be handled by the method or class creators, since it seems impossible 
to impart this knowledge to the class or method user.
the class or method user shouldn't need to know anything about how the 
class works except what methods can be called, properties that are 
available etc.
I don't know really , though

I would like to see the Type Hinting expanded in PHP 6. In 5 now you can do

class Test {

public function testDatabase( Database $db ) {

}
}

what if i wanted to make sure it was a String, Integer, Boolean, Float, 
etc.. i would like to see that added to the type hinting ;)

I suggested it hopefully they implement it ;)

It might be nice if at least, short of forcing you to catch or throw a la
Java, you could set some sort of error reporting to alert you that you
might have had an uncaught exception from called $some->method() at line
xxx. (Yes I'm aware of set_exception_handler(), but still...).

Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20050815175450.021259a0@mail.optonline.net>

Here is a problem which I have been able to work around but haven't been 
able to understand.

1.  form script starts a session, shows a form, submits it to a checking 
script.
2.  checking script starts a session and checks whether some fields
have been filled in.  If not, uses header to go back to the form with
an appropriate reminder.  If so, stores post info into session and
uses header to go back to form script.
3.  form script starts session, retrieves session info, and emails it.

This works perfectly unless cookies are turned off.  When cookies are
turned off, the docs say that PHP will send the SID as a get variable.
But when I test in Firefox/WinXP the SID is not passed, and so the
session info is not available to the email, and so the form info is
not sent.

The host has session.use_cookies set on, and session.use_only_cookies
set off, and session.use_trans_sid set on. This to me means that the
sessions should be working even without cookies--but they aren't. What
no doubt obvious thing am I overlooking?

I try my best not to use header redirects if possible. Things get kind 
of hairy sometimes.
In your case,  PHP might not be appending the sessions id's to your  
header("Location:webform.php").
You might want to try something like:

if (!$_COOKIE['SID']) {    // if there is no session id cookie set, 
redirect with the SID in the url.
    header("Location:webform.php?SID=$SID");
}
else {  // otherwise do a standard redirect
    header("Location:webform.php"); 
}



I haven't tested the above, but conceptually it should work.

This depends on session.use_trans_sid. With it enabled, PHP will rewrite 
URLs (as necessary) according to url_rewriter.tags, which defaults to 
a=href,area=href,frame=src,input=src,form=fakeentry,fieldset=.

In other words, it's rewriting URLs in your HTML. It's not going to 
modify your calls to header() for you.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Whenever someone mentions inconsistent behavior with the use of the 
Location header, it always seems to be because they do not format the 
header properly. Try this:

header('Location: http://example.org/webform.php');

The header() function is great - PHP gives us a lot of control over the 
exact HTTP response that we send. However, this is also an opportunity 
for us to screw up the format. Be careful. :-)

The following has always worked for me even when cookies are turned off.

header('location: xxx?PHPSESSID='.session_id());

Just makes the url's a little messy.

Yesterday IBM made a formal announcement about our code contributions to 
Firefox 1.5 (due out this September) with respect to Accessibility. These 
announcements focused on the technology Laurent Hasson and I demonstrated 
to NYPHP back on July 26th. Since the technology is DHTML based, it is 
applicable to PHP programmers.

Details on the technology can be found at: www.mozilla.org/access/dhtml

Thanks Dan for yours and IBM's effort in this area.

Are you still interested in preparing a webcast of your presentation
for those that missed it?

I'd be intrigued to see it again, as I've had more time to play with
AJAX recently...though haven't gotten to testing RAD (and your JSF)
yet.

Whether the webcast is focused on your Javascript libraries or
accessibility features, I'm sure there will be plenty interested
(within and outside the NYPHP community).

This really comes down to the license.  If it's GPL, you basically are legally bound to make your "derived works" public as well.  Of course, what defines derived works is not something clearly defined.

Ugh - there's that word again, free :)

It's certainly a sticky area.  But, keep in mind, that most of the larger open source projects, like PHP and Apache, are licensed using a BSD style license.  These questions should only be answered by lawyers, but most source from PEAR and PECL should have a header indicating the license.  Typically, this is the PHP license, and so you're likely safe - but again, no one really knows :)

yes, that does it (and as is usually the case, obvious once somebody says 
it); thanks.  But as Chris Shiflett notes, header() format is important: 
the L in location should be capitalized, and there should be a space after 
the colon (it looks as though you do have one).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] character set filtering
Message-ID: <43020C0F.3020203@iifwp.org>

Hi All,

I've googled around a little but probably am not using the right key 
words, so I ask for a few suggestions:

Our online database system is meant sooner or later to allow several 
thousand of our contacts to start updating their own data records (with 
careful data screening on our side of course).  The big sticking point 
for me is that we can't have them submitting it in just whatever 
character set they want.  For example, we don't want to let a Japanese 
user send in his name in Chinese characters, or any kind of kana either; 
the Koreans shouldn't be allowed to submit Hangul, etc., etc.  So 
somewhere in the system I have to screen user input to be sure it's 
limited to a certain character set. 

Questions I'm struggling with along this line are these:
* What character set shall we use?  (For example, of course we don't 
allow Chinese, Thai, Arabic, etc., but what about umlauts and the 
occassional enye?)  That's an internal decision for us, I'm sure, but do 
you know of technical points I should be sure to consider?
* How will I screen the incoming data?  Do I just hack some regex 
together and run everything through it, or is there a library I should 
consider, etc.?
* How totally without clue am I about this whole topic?

If you have specific examples of sites that are doing a good job with 
this, or links to more I could read on the topic, that would be great, 
but I'd love to hear any suggestions or experience you can share.

Thanks,
Allen

Can't agree more. 

Security topics as related to all installations, administration and in
development should be advanced. 

In books security steps should be Chapter 3, not Chapter 11. In discussions
security should be in Part 2 not in the closing Q&A. In READMEs security
steps should be organized and grouped near the top of the file. In seminars
recommended security should be discussed in the early hours of presentation.

Security steps should not be recommended later, they must be early,
mandatory, and restrictive. 

E.g.: kudos to MySQL for their most recent installer that clearly enjoins a
password on root before deployment.

Why are installs by default too insecure and users have to stumble onto the
secure methods after the fact. Why not install locked down and let users
stumble onto the loosening methods after the fact.

Peter

I suspect the looseness of default security is proportional to the rate 
of adoption by new technology users. Loose defaults = more initial 
adoption, strict defaults = more dropped users. I also suspect MySQL's 
imposing a default root pw has more to do with their lessened need to 
accommodate new users now that they are "established", than the call for 
increased default security. As many can attest, a strong root pw on a 
fresh install of MySQL does not a secure environment make.

I follow your thread entirely and empathize marginally with the
observations. 

Further, though, I'll note that we all understand that we must pass a
written test and road test to get a license to drive and almost the entire
emphasis is on safety in this driving learning curve. We don't let newbie
drivers just careen about unsafely at first just to get them on the road and
adapted to driving. We don't let new electricians wire away till they get it
right.

I believe that the defacto standard for out of the box product and
programming will become more like "locked down, instant secure setup", "data
encrypted", "all SSL" and "no anonymous access".

We will all be reading on newbie forums questions like: "How do I let my
users access their admin site without a strong password or Smart card." And
the answers will be: "Typically impossible. Why would you do that anyway,
newbie?" 

I can only hope. Because I really want to use and trust the internet for
banking, personal storage, controlling my home and appliances, and using a
"safe" ATM without concern that my PIN is being scarfed by the staff behind
the counter.

Doesn't it bother you that emails and web sites have become digital
ambushes. That dealing with your own bank has become caveat emptor.

This is our personal privacy at stake and the forward reputation of our
entire industry is in the cusp. 

I think we will need to look towards some self regulation or at least a
common set of minimum standards for large-scale opensource projects. Maybe
even have code get an association's security endorsement similar to
Underwriters Laboratories, say.

I'd certainly like to hear from more programmer's who believe that insecure
programming methods can still be endorsed in any way.

We need a security spearhead, one programmer, one product at a time, if that
is what it takes.

Peter

I agree and disagree.

I think it's great that FreeBSD comes shipped without the ability to 
SSH in as root. I was used to that ability in Red Hat, and when I tried 
FreeBSD, I was surprised for a moment, but then I thought about it, and 
if I ever use a Linux distro that allows that, it will be the first 
thing I change.

But security is a moving target. A lot of hardening  is in response to 
exploits, not as a result of pre-engineering.
So, while I'm glad that experts may be willing to start things off with 
heightened security, I realize that security is an ongoing process.

No average web programmer would be comfortable with the "secure"  setup 
of a web security "expert" of five years ago.

If that wish came true, there would be an immediate market for new 
systems that are not locked down. "Find a need and fill it" is a truism 
of free markets (and even not-so-free markets).

In my OPIONION, there in lies the error. Where there is TRUST there will 
be exploitation, so whatever is behind the lock must be additionally 
protected against the inevitable exploitation.

IMHO those who are LICENSED or otherwise REGULATED (in other words, 
those who have been granted a public trust -- like bankers) should be 
help accountable for the consequences of exploitations of systems which 
they have "trusted". That is the missing link, and until it is found 
should "we" be putting valuable assets (e.g. info) online?

If my home appliances can be turned on remotely, they should not turn on 
unless I myself did it. If they do turn on and I didn't do it, I should 
not be responsible for the consequences. Who should? How can that 
accountable party make sure it was ME turning them on? Until technology 
can solve that, we should not make my home appliances part of the public 
internet. Until you are prepared to license the internet, it may be best 
NOT to trust it. Heresy... you bet!

You have ALWAYS been wise to deal carefully with your bank. Sometimes I 
think a few generations of Americans raised by post-war parents were 
spoiled with a mythical trusted government/trusted "system" belief, and 
that the recent world events are not so much highlighting a new problem, 
but conradicting the false hopes put forth in that upbringing. Welcome 
to reality, and I am sorry to here you were misled.

I often arrive at the same conclusion on these issues: grant partial 
ownership (and subsequent accountability) to the coders. Secure 
programming is needed to the extent that the product behind the lock 
needs protection. Place the burden of PROTECTION onto the people 
building the locks, and the whole world changes.

Consider what would happen if you held locksmiths accountable for losses 
whenever a lock was picked or otherwise evaded. What would happen? A 
whole slew of locksmiths would refuse to put locks onto doors, because 
they knew the locks would not prevent theft. They would need to know 
WHAT WAS BEING PROTECTED, WHAT OTHER ACTORS PARTICIPATED IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT, and would want some asurances that the system would not be 
used for other purposes that that for which it was designed and 
approved. Now consider programming.....

I don't believe we could advance if we didn't build imperfect systems 
and analyze them. I don't think we could achieve social security without 
experiencing exploits and learning from them. I also don't believe we 
should trust these systems when we know they are not trustworthy (!)  I 
leave the "why we do that anyway" as an exercise for the reader ;-)

I'm trying to formulate a question out of this. If there isn't one here, 
I hope the read is interesting.
My goal is to create the simplest efficient graph data structures - that 
allow for cycles.

The reason one would want cycles in a graph is the following:
a->b
and
b->a
(or b->a again with another arc (also known as a hypergraph))
or
a->a

 where '->' is an arc
Even if the arcs are labled, the data in 'a' is something I don't want 
to duplicate.

I am using php version 4.3.11

If I try to do this with a simple php array:

    $a = array();
    $b = array();
   
    $a['b'] = & $b;
    $b['a'] = & $a;

    print_r($a);

Array
(
    [a] => Array
        (
            [b] => Array
                (
                    [a] => Array
 *RECURSION*
                )

        )

)


I get this recursion error. Or, perhaps this is not an error at all. But 
I can't seem to use this function:

    function recursive_print($array)
    {
        foreach($array as $key => $value)
        {
            if (is_array($value))
            {
                echo $key .' <hr /> ' .recursive_print($value);
            }
            else
            {
                echo 'end'.$value;
            }
        }
    }

So I went to the PEAR site - http://pear.php.net/package/Structures_Graph
This pear package doesn't throw any errors but it also seems to balk  - 
although I am not sure the *RECURSION* will affect functionality


    include 'Structures/Graph.php';
    $directedGraph =& new Structures_Graph(true);
    $nodeOne =& new Structures_Graph_Node();
    $nodeTwo =& new Structures_Graph_Node();

   
    $directedGraph->addNode(&$nodeOne);
    $directedGraph->addNode(&$nodeTwo);

   
    $nodeOne->connectTo($nodeTwo);
    $nodeTwo->connectTo($nodeOne);


Inside the code I found a comment about the Zend engine before the data 
structure procedes to iteratively loop through the the nodes to see if 
there are duplicates.
            /*
             ZE1 equality operators choke on the recursive cycle 
introduced by the _graph field in the Node object.
             So, we'll check references the hard way
            */

Even so, print_r produces many recursion warnings.

Maybe I am just trying to use a hammer for a screwdriver. But can anyone 
offer any insight here?

Thanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP 5 Objects
Message-ID: <8d9a428005081705534ed0deec@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

Is there a way to accomplish this?

i am creating a set of objects for storing objects serialized accross pages. 
I have the following


<?php
abstract class Objects {
public function __construct() {

}

abstract function load($class);
abstract function save($class);

}
?>

<?php
class FileObjects extends Objects {

public function __construct() {

}

public function load($class) {

}

public function save($obj) {

}
}
?>

<?php
class FileObjects extends Objects {

public function __construct() {

}

public function load($class) {

}

public function save($obj) {

}
}
?>

The issue i am running into is when i save an object, how do i know what 
type the object is? How do i know it is of type User/Database/FileObject, 
etc... I cannot simply go through a ton of if statements, and i cannot force 
each class to have a __tostring() method.

Johathan,

Have you considered putting the nodes into one array, and the arcs into a
second?

$nodes = array('a'=>array(..info..),'b'=>array(..info..));

$arcs = array(array('a','b'),array('b','a'))

This allows each node's info to be stored only once, and allows you to
then treat the arcs cleanly, allowing or disallowing any combo you may
choose.

You may have to write a little of your code to walk through things, but
you'll have complete integrity and control.

That seems to be a very elegant solution to the problem, top stuff!

Is it mandatory that you use PHP to solve your problem?

If not, then I suggest you consider using Perl. Unless I'm
mistaken, there doesn't seem to be quite the codebase
in PHP for these sorts of abstract computer science
problems. Perl is another story. CPAN contains 1000s
of modules for this kind of thing, and a quick search
revealed this promising package: 

http://search.cpan.org/~jhi/Graph-0.66/lib/Graph.pod

Gasp! Someone posting a message about Perl to a PHP
mailing list? Let me tell you, I was using Perl long before
PHP was nothing but a bunch of CGI scripts (written in
Perl mind you, and later in C).

Also, the languages are very similar, so you may be able
to port the Perl Graph library to PHP. HTH ~d

Hi Kenneth,

Thanks very much. I like what you have posted!
I think I would add keys to the arrays and add one more dimension so 
that there can be multiple graphs with the same label.

$arcs['likes'][]  = array('a','a');
$arcs['likes'][]  = array('a','b');
$arcs['knows'][]  = array('a','b');

$arcs['knows'][]  = array('b','a');
$arcs['confusedby'][]  = array('b','a');

 I can get the functionality I need from this.
I wonder how scalable this is. What if there are over 5 million arcs. My 
traversal algorithms would have to be very efficient.

Another package I am looking at for graph manipulation is bundled with 
the PHP RDF package RAP.

http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/rdfapi
http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/rdfapi/tutorial/usingNamedGraphs.htm#ng-intro

They use quads - where a quad is a labeled graph. In the above data 
structure, a new graph would just be a new set of arcs. So it looks like 
nothing is missing from this array based graph.

Hmm, or why not

$arcs['a']['likes']['b'] = true;
$arcs['b']['likes']['b'] = false;
or
$arcs['b']['likes']['chocolate'][] = '80%';
$arcs['b']['likes']['chocolate'][] = 'quite significantly';

Then I can have a "triple" with a label and a value.

This could be interesting.

Hi Douglas,

Perl is a perfectly rational choice and more proven for lower level 
number crunching and data structures than PHP, I believe. Python would 
also be a good choice. To reflect on language choice for certain 
problems is important. There are also graph libraries in C 
(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) that could be used as 
custom/dynamically loading modules in PHP . Can I make a feature request 
for PHP 6 - a native and fast graph manipulation library?

I chose PHP because it's so widely deployed in web hosting environments.
Can I embed/call perl functions in php easily? (PHP doesn't run on 
Parrot yet)

- Jonathan

PS

I also choose PHP because I started using PHP long after you were using 
Perl ;)

Doug,

I found these articles relating to using perl from within PHP. Not sure 
about performance.

http://wiki.cc/php/Perl
http://www.zend.com/php5/articles/php5-perl.php

Have you used these techniques?
Any idea if perl.so is cross platform?

How do you print to STDOUT so that what you're printing ~replaces~ what
you previously printed to STDOUT, instead of appending? You know, like the
way PEAR installer shows you download progress with a btye counter that
keeps updating itself?

I haven't been able to Google this effectively because I don't quite know
how to put it.

I looked around for a PEAR package but couldn't find any. I examined some
of the source involved in the pear installer but also came up empty.

Thanks,

When you write a new line use \r instead of \n. This will take you back 
to the begining of the line where you can output new information. You 
have to explicitly overwrite any old characters for them to go away. If 
the second set of output is shorter than the first, the extra characters 
from the first line will still be seen.

There's the console progressbar package:

http://pear.php.net/package/Console_ProgressBar

You may want to look at that (and the other console packages) to get 
some ideas.

Good Luck!

Jonathan,

Glad this helped.

If your graphs get big then you must do this in a database, don't attempt
it in scripts.

Many people recommend mySQl because it is free, but PostgreSQL is far more
capable and is also free.

Going off topic:

Thinking of ways to persist the graph :
I've used MySQL a long time and see them as only getting better. But 
their dual license deters me from some uses. - what about SQLite - also 
completely free (LGPL, MIT, or Apache  License I think), small, and fast?
Or dbm functions if I only need to store hashes?

I'll feel silly if I reinvent the work of the RAP RDF datastore. I'll 
have to write tests and a couple implementations so I can know what is 
faster and more efficient.

here is one I made the other day for doing a spin-cursor on FTP
transfers:

// just call with no arguments inside a loop.
function progress(){
	global $spinnerpos;
	$spinner = array("/","-","\\","\\|","/","-","\\","\\|");
	passthru("printf \"\\b\"".$spinner[$spinnerpos] ." ");
	$spinnerpos=($spinnerpos +1)%8;
}

Cheers.

My experience in db servers is limited to MS SQL Server, IBM DB/2 and
Postgres.  Postgres is the one I pick when the decision is mine.  The
others I really cannot comment on.

Also, as for the table design, a google search on both web pages and
newsgroups should yield some pre-existing solutions.

I'll likely use ADODB  as a DB abstraction layer - they even have a C 
module. That should keep my options open.
I like ADODB but I haven't used php's dbx or PEAR db either.
I am not sure if some db features won't be available to me, like certain 
kinds of indexes or table types that I am used to setting in MySQL.
As for Postgres, I fear the complexity a bit.

this a while back..

posted the code here for doing termcolored graphs..

Joel,

I played a little with your spinner and couldn't get it to work 
properly.  I did come up with this though, which works on both my WinXP 
laptop and Linux dev server:

function progress()
{
   static $spinnerpos = 0;
   static $spinner = '-';
   $spinners = array('-','\\','|','/');

   echo $spinner;
   flush();

   $spinnerpos = ($spinnerpos+1)%4;
   $spinner = "\x8".$spinners[$spinnerpos];
}

The best system is usually the one that works, and if you are comfortable
with mySQL then that is the one that works  :)

Let us know how this turns out.

Message-ID: <330532b60508172115cd76019@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies for the crosspost, but it is a bit of a humdinger of an
announcement ;-)

So we're back from LinuxWorld in San Francisco (where we won Best Open
Source Solution, woo-hoo!), and things have been moving at 1,000,000
miles per hour in Mamboland. If you follow Mambo, you've probably been
tracking some of the dissension within the community after the recent
formation of the Mambo Foundation by Miro Ltd. Tonight, the core
development team has released an official response:

http://opensourcematters.org

Please visit here for updates on our future, and be sure to join the
new forums to participate in our ongoing discussions with the
community.

We can't say any more than what is in the official statement right
now, but we have retained the services of the Software Freedom Law
Center and will be providing more details about our plan shortly.

ALSO: If you're not familiar with the SFLC, it doesn't get much
better. Here are a few of the people on the SFLC team: Eben Moglen,
Lawrence Lessig, Dan Ravicher, and Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the
W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).

Does anyone know of a good tutorial or documentation for Mantis? The
documentation link on the Mantis website is broken.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] 'CHECK TABLE' syntax for Postgres
Message-ID: <1124378491.18456.240969212@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all,

I am back from the land of the disappeared. How has the weather in
NYPHPland been since I was gone?

I have a question that I hope some Postgres gurus could answer. MySQL
lets you run a query with the syntax 'CHECK TABLE my_table' to see what
is wrong with it. More info:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/check-table.html

I was wondering if Postgres has something similar, or if it uses an
external tool. I did a fair bit of Googling, but have come up with
nothing so far.

Also - does it have something similar to MySQL's 'REPAIR TABLE' syntax
if problems are found and tables need to be repaired? More info:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/repair-table.html

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

- Jay

I've been having some trouble getting DataObjects to recognize the
keys in Oracle. So, it generates the skeleton classes and ini file,
but does not create key entries for each table. Anyone else have any
luck using DataObjects and Oracle?

Has anyone heard anything or used PHP multiple newsletter?

http://www.phpmultiplenewsletters.com/index.html

At the moment I'm a little too busy to create a custom one for what I need 
so I'm on the hunt for some premade ones, if anyone has used other software 
too that would be great- preferably free as this project is being funded by 
me and a friend of mine, and we're both going into college next year and 
could use all the cash we can get right now :)

All I need it to do is be able to register users, and send them an email 
using a form, but not show the recipients the emails of the other users on 
the group (simple I know, but that's rather important to me).

Thanks in advance

Hi Steve

See in this example from php.net

|$filename = "/usr/local/something.txt";
$handle = fopen($filename, "r");
$contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
fclose($handle);

|What  is happening for you is that the second parameter is 0 or less.
This means that the file you are trying to load is probably empty.

I'm just quoting the PHP.net site again.
Sorry if you've tried these things already.
Is it a binary file?

With large files you might need to break it up:


|<?php
$handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "rb");
$contents = '';
while (!feof($handle)) {
  $contents .= fread($handle, 8192);
}
fclose($handle);
?> |

    *Note: * If you just want to get the contents of a file into a
    string, use *file_get_contents()*
    <http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php> as it
    has much better performance than the code above.

I see, so it's a binary file.

Have you tried ?
|fopen("http://www.example.com/", "rb"); |

This is great stuff - good to see this type of functionality coming out into
the public.  With PHP on the server and this type of flexibility in the
client, the day of rich internet apps is coming quick.

Looking forward to the next release of FireFox, and to getting a web cast
out there as Chris mentioned.

Thanks Dan

Why is it that in my php.ini I have session.use_cookies set to 1, but when I 
view a site of mine it appends the links to say ?PHPSESSID=xxxxxxxxxxxxx, 
even though my browser has cookies enabled?

I think I'm going to set session.use_only_cookies to 1 as well, but I'm 
always learly about limiting a portion of the community from viewing content 
if there's an availible workaround for it.

Checkout the list archives:

And the PHP-GTK mailing list archives:

(for more results try searching for "php compiler")

Cool, thanks for the collateral reference to PHP GTK. It answers a problem that came in the mail last night.  :)

I friend wants me to write something that lets people enter data, the forms does some minor math, and then produces a printable output. Ideally the process would allow writing the data to a local file so the user could pull up old forms, edit them, and then print them again. I didn't know php-gtk existed, but am starting to try it in another window. 

Well, try to get it to work, I think. So far it doesn't look to be a robust install and the test scripts fail.  :(

But my question is, to do the above, what PHP extensions/tools would be needed? The user would tend to be non-technical, and there would be no mysql/apache; just PHP and the data files. It would need to run on Windows, from old verions to the newest.

ciao!

PHP-GTK has some odd dependencies at the moment. PHP-GTK 1.0.2 requires 
PHP 4.3.x and will not work with PHP 5. PHP-GTK 2.0 is still under 
development but requires PHP 5.1 or greater. If you have PHP 4.3.x and 
you are installing on windows, installation is easy. Just download a 
file, unzip it and copy a directory or two. Linux is a little more 
complicated but is 300% better than it was in the past. If you check the 
PHP-GTK mailing list archives, you will find answers to almost any 
installation issue.

I think PHP-GTK is a perfect solution but then again I may be a little 
biased.

Hehe...why would that be?  Okay, taking the php-gtk install issues out of the thread as I need to deal with those seperately, what tools would be required? I want to:

1. Create the PHP programs and extensions and have them on the CD the client gets.
2. I don't have any Windows compilers or PHP Zend-y type things either. What would be needed?
3. Is php-gtk 2.0 close enough that using PHP 5.x would be adviseable? This is a stand-alone app so I don't need to stick with PHP 4.x. Not that I mind either, but most of the web-sites I've seen are on PHP 4.x.
4. Are there old versions of windows that PHP doesn't run on? This is a serious question--many of the clients are on software that is very old. I'd not be surprised of someone had Win 95 or even Win 3.1.

ciao!

Try bCompiler. It is a PECL package and claims to turn PHP scripts into 
full functioning executables that don't require PHP to be installed. I 
haven't used it myself but I have heard success stories.

> 3. Is php-gtk 2.0 close enough that using PHP 5.x would be adviseable? This is a stand-alone app so I don't need to stick with PHP 4.x. Not that I mind either, but most of the web-sites I've seen are on PHP 4.x.

PHP-GTK 2.0 hasn't even had an alpha release yet (mainly because of the 
installation issues) so I wouldn't recommend using it for production 
code quite yet.

I believe that future releasees will drop support for win9x.

I'm just stating some assumptions here so I might learn:

Wouldn't winbinder let you run on windows natively? If you don't need a 
cross-platform gui or you can use native windows GUI.
http://www.hypervisual.com/winbinder/

http://www.php-compiler.net/ wouldn't help you with win 3.1 or 95.... or 
would it?

GTK is certainly the best cross platform choice for GUIs using php.

What about XUL? (not sure what I am asking here...
http://wiki.mozilla.org/XUL:Xul_Runner
http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/articleview/82/1/2/
http://pear.php.net/package/XML_XUL)

You probably have session.use_trans_sid enabled. PHP has to rewrite URLs 
on the first page, because it hasn't had a chance to determine whether 
the client has cookie support enabled.

Hope that helps.

I think you'll be much happier with BBedit on the Mac. And for CSS
things this editor looks pretty cool:

For clickstream analysis, is there a way to link the phpsessid with
apache 1.3 log files?  If so, is it for the default php session
handler? or a custom built one with mysql?

Not to mention that if someone bookmarks the page, the session id will
get stored in the user's bookmark url!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] All-in-one authentication class
Message-ID: <b762526905081911205d440f9@mail.gmail.com>

A graphic designer friend asked me if I knew of any drop-in PHP
solutions for providing user authentication -- something that includes
forms and logic for handling user registration (possibly with email
confirmation), login, and password change. Using native PHP sessions
of course.

Good documentation / howto for non-programmers would be a bonus.

PEAR auth is too barebones, as it expects you to create all the forms
and much of the logic. Clew's pauth is too complex.

There must be something like this out there... any suggestions?

If the session has expired such as in browser close or timeout, the 
bookmarked page won't be a liability as the session id in the URL won't 
find a matching session id on the server.

Authentication would fail and the result might be the user being sent 
back to the login page.

I think...  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

VACUUM ANALYZE, probably.

There's also a shell script version that can be run from a nightly crontab.

The server doesn't know when the browser is closed, so that part's not 
right. It is true that a session timeout (on the server side) offers 
some protection against this type of accidental hijacking.

Hope that helps.

I started that old NYPHP List thread and after trying Roadsend for a
while I ended up abandoning it and switching to Perl and perlcc. The
results were much better/faster for what I was doing (cross platform
string/file manipulation).

Just in case you were interested...

Perl is certainly capable (Perl 6 and Parrot too). Python isn't anything 
to sniff at for compiling either.
Since I'm already invested in PHP, I might start with native PHP and 
some accelerator and then porting to C/C++ to make shared libraries. 
I've sent some questions to roadsend - like if/when they'll have

 - php 5 support
 - apache 2 support
 - is it possible to build in custom .so/.dlls (I guess if you buy their 
source code license)
 
Maybe I am getting outside PHPs niche into areas it "shouldn't" be used - \
I still think I can prototype what I want to in PHP though...

There used to be (perhaps still are?) some Roadsend developers on this list.
They're out in Long Island.

I know the last time I spoke to them, they were working on some of the above
items.  Would be interested to hear where things stand now.

Hiya,

If you're over on WWWAC you've already seen this but I'm asking here
from another slant. I have no idea what I can or can't do withOUT
having to create/manage a mySQL db...my server will let me do this
easily enough but it's been over a year since I've thought of PHP or
mySQL and I don't want to get so distracted by the programming
mindset that I forget what I was doing in the first place (trying to
do some marketing).

Below is the process I'm trying to implement - step 5 is where I'm
fuzzy...I know I could definitely have the URL come back to a
PHP page that looks up the string in a db (and a very simple one,
I'm sure, since it's just a list) but I'd rather just have the URL come
back to the Flash file and do the checking from within the .swf,
with ActionScript - is that easier or harder? Since you guys all love
PHP and probably only half of you even like AS, I know it's a biased
answer I'll get :-) but try to be objective and not play favorites
on the languages here.

What I want to do:

(1) user gives me email address

(2) with a PHP script (free from http://www.allhype.co.uk/tools/md5/
and a very nice script actually!!) I MD5 their email address

(3) I send user a message (to validate the address works) that has
their MD5'd address as a link for them to come back and get what
they want

(4) user clicks unique query string in the email I've sent them

(4) I validate the string .....how/from where is the ??? :)

(5) if valid, give them the Flash file; if not, give them an error message

Any help much appreciated!

You could do all of this with just Flash, etc. assuming Flash has MD5, as
I'm sure it does, but you'll be limited.  If you want to track who has
downloaded what files, the browser they're using, etc. you won't be able to
do so without a DB.

There's also a security concern here.  There's no way to know that the email
address you've gotten originally, is the same as the one that's coming from
the link.  Since you're not storing anything anywhere, you have no way to
keep persistent data.  If I know that you're checking that an MD5 matches
the MD5 of the email address, I can pass you any MD5 I want, and it'll
validate.

A bookmarked session id might not result in a hijacked session, but
it's not a good idea have session ids exposed and kept around like
that.

Consider another example:  Someone is logged into a newspaper site and
sees an interesing article.  The user copies the url (with session id)
and pastes it in an email to a friend.  If the friend receives the
email quickly and the server has a long timeout, accidential session
hijacking could occur.

The primary reason to have a session id in the url is if the browser
doesn't support cookies, right?

I think you have the purpose of the MD5 hash confused. In this case,
you want it to be an *unguessable* token that the user can bring back
to you to prove that they got they got your validation message, and
that they own the mailbox associated with the provided email address.

In other words, it should be random. If it's just the hash of their
email address, then an impersonator could easily generate the right
token and validate an address that isn't their own (as Hans pointed
out).

You will need some sort of DB -- MySQL or flat file or otherwise -- to
store the email address and the random token in the same record, so
that when the user clicks the link with the token in it, you can look
up the email and mark it valid.

Ahh, now I'm still confused :\

I added this to a main included file at the top:

ini_set("session.use_trans_sid", 0);

ini_set("session.use_only_cookies", 1);

However, I'm still seeing "?PHPSESSID=xxxxxxxxxxx" in my URL's.

I apologize in advance if I'm getting this wrong, but I tested it in IE and 
Firefox, and no luck either way. Not to mention that cookies are enabled on 
both browsers so it shouldn't even be resorting to the URL. 

I then put 

echo ini_get("session.use_only_cookies");

and the output is 1, but it is still giving the sessid through the URL. If 
anyone knows whats going on, I would appreciate some help fixing this :\ 
Thanks.

Thanks for the explicit verification, Chris. You and Hans are both
right, I am definitely fuzzy on using MD5 hashing (how and why).
I also am not looking to do the serious user management Hans
points out is lacking from my algorith, just as you guys noted,
some quick little lookup verification.

Thanks for the help...time to drag out the 7-yr-old Dell again,
where my Apache/PHP/mySQL installation residies. Gonna be
hard after working on the Toshiba Satellite, but thank you for
the sanity check on this, guys! I'll just stick to PHP for the whole
shebang--it's such a great language and all I really need out of
Flash is the pretty picture part, not ActionScripting.

XAMPP rocks. Just be careful of the placement and settings of INI files
if you already have others on your machine. And look at your PHP.ini
file. I thought the default setting for magic_quotes in PHP5 is off.
XAMPP has it turned on, which caused some head scratching.

As a side note, Flash / Actionscript does not have native crypto functions /

need them...

Good luck!

That seems to be the same problem I'm having, so is it okay that the URL 
only gets rewritten on the first page? Because that's all I'm seeing as of 
now, but I thought that was almost as dangerous as it being there all the 
time.

Appreciate the help.

Hans, here's what Shannon at Roadsend had to say:

Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for you interest in the Roadsend Compiler!

Yes we are planning PHP 5 support, but it will probably not be available 
until a release sometime next year. Currently we are focused on adding 
more extension support through a compatibility layer that will allow the 
use of open source php extensions.

We are also working on adding the ability to compile an application with 
a built in web server, so you can distribute web applications as stand 
alone programs.

> 2. Are you planning Apache 2 support? The reason it only works under

Yes, but before native Apache 2 support shows up we will probably have a 
better CGI interface (using FastCGI) that would allow the use of a 
compiled apps under Apache 2, IIS and other web servers.

> 3. Did you run your benchmarks against php with eAccelerater, etc.?


The benchmarks posted on the site were run against a plain open source 
PHP install.

In the current release there is no easy way to do a stand alone web 
server app.

The new feature we are working on that I mentioned above will embed a 
small web server right into the final executable. When the executable is 
run, it begins listening on a (customizable) port so all the user has to 
do is point a browser to it. It will then begin serving (compiled) pages 
like a normal PHP application.

You would not have to bundle anything besides the required binaries and 
supporting files (images, external files the app uses, required 
supporting libraries, etc).

> 5. If I write my own .so or use libxml2 or mcrypt, technically

>

Our compiler will allow you to create a binary that uses external 
libraries, but you are still responsible for adhering to the license 
restrictions for that particular library. For example, if you create a 
commercial, closed source application that requires the MySQL library, 
they require you to purchase a license, as explained here: 
http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/faq.html

On the other hand, libxml2 and libpcre are free to use commercially, so 
it depends on the library.

Let me know if I can answer any more questions.

As far as I understand, session.use_only_cookies should NOT rewrite the 
URL even on the first page.
session.use_cookies  WILL rewrite the first page and decide from then 
on whether to use cookies (if enabled) or continue rewriting.

someone else can chime in if this doesn't sound right.

Hiya,

If you're over on WWWAC you've already seen this but I'm asking here
from another slant. I have no idea what I can or can't do withOUT
having to create/manage a mySQL db...my server will let me do this
easily enough but it's been over a year since I've thought of PHP or
mySQL and I don't want to get so distracted by the programming
mindset that I forget what I was doing in the first place (trying to
do some marketing).

Below is the process I'm trying to implement - step 5 is where I'm
fuzzy...I know I could definitely have the URL come back to a
PHP page that looks up the string in a db (and a very simple one,
I'm sure, since it's just a list) but I'd rather just have the URL come
back to the Flash file and do the checking from within the .swf,
with ActionScript - is that easier or harder? Since you guys all love
PHP and probably only half of you even like AS, I know it's a biased
answer I'll get :-) but try to be objective and not play favorites
on the languages here.

What I want to do:

(1) user gives me email address

(2) with a PHP script (free from http://www.allhype.co.uk/tools/md5/
and a very nice script actually!!) I MD5 their email address

(3) I send user a message (to validate the address works) that has
their MD5'd address as a link for them to come back and get what
they want

(4) user clicks unique query string in the email I've sent them

(4) I validate the string .....how/from where is the ??? :)

(5) if valid, give them the Flash file; if not, give them an error message

Any help much appreciated!

You could do all of this with just Flash, etc. assuming Flash has MD5, as
I'm sure it does, but you'll be limited. If you want to track who has
downloaded what files, the browser they're using, etc. you won't be able to
do so without a DB.

There's also a security concern here. There's no way to know that the email
address you've gotten originally, is the same as the one that's coming from
the link. Since you're not storing anything anywhere, you have no way to
keep persistent data. If I know that you're checking that an MD5 matches
the MD5 of the email address, I can pass you any MD5 I want, and it'll
validate.

A bookmarked session id might not result in a hijacked session, but
it's not a good idea have session ids exposed and kept around like
that.

Consider another example: Someone is logged into a newspaper site and
sees an interesing article. The user copies the url (with session id)
and pastes it in an email to a friend. If the friend receives the
email quickly and the server has a long timeout, accidential session
hijacking could occur.

The primary reason to have a session id in the url is if the browser
doesn't support cookies, right?

I think you have the purpose of the MD5 hash confused. In this case,
you want it to be an *unguessable* token that the user can bring back
to you to prove that they got they got your validation message, and
that they own the mailbox associated with the provided email address.

In other words, it should be random. If it's just the hash of their
email address, then an impersonator could easily generate the right
token and validate an address that isn't their own (as Hans pointed
out).

You will need some sort of DB -- MySQL or flat file or otherwise -- to
store the email address and the random token in the same record, so
that when the user clicks the link with the token in it, you can look
up the email and mark it valid.

OK, I'm a little out of my element here, but I think that's not true. 
The GPL requires you to release the source for any derived works that 
you release. You are not required to release anything; it's just that if 
you do release something, you must also release the source. GPL-derived 
code that you want to keep internal to your organization is A-OK.

These questions should only be answered by lawyers, but most source from PEAR and PECL should have a header indicating the license.  Typically, this is the PHP license, and so you're likely safe - but again, no one really knows :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Session Handling
Message-ID: <010d01c5a79c$a7e90450$0164a8c0@aum1>

Hello all,

I have slightly different problem related to sessions when your session is idle for more than specified interval. In our case we are having high traffic website where hundreds of session are created every time.

I wanted to increase session's inactive time out from default 24 to 2 hours. So we increased value of below php directive in httpd.conf

php_value session.gc_maxlifetime 7200

But interestingly, this is not working at all and session is seen as garbage after it's default timeout period set by php (i.e 24 mins). We store session files at default location (i.e under "/tmp") and it supports "atime" attribute as well. phpinfo() also shows local value of above directive as set to 7200 but session doesn't remain active for that amount time and is deleted after 24 hours.

I have noticed on various forums that many ppl have faced this problem, and they do not have solution either. Does anyone have any ideas about this problem? Or am I missing some more configurations?

I am using LAMP technology to run my website and as far as I know everything is properly configured like php.ini and httpd.conf.

Thanks,

Anirudh Zala

Hello all,

A silly question perhaps but I'm fairly new to PHP and looking to do 
some work on a new MySQL driven website - I have been asked to provide 
reasons why PHP is a better option than ASP. I am not familiar with ASP 
so if anyone out there can trash it for me... I mean give good reasons 
why ASP should not be used for this application it would be really 
useful! I'm hoping to use this project to really push my PHP learning so 
I really don't want the owners of the site to go with ASP.

Well,

here are a few reasons i can think of ;)

PHP++
Cross Platform (can run on windows, linux, osx, etc..)
Free to use
Syntax is GREAT (personal opinion)
Object Oriented very easy to expand in the future

ASP 3.0--
Not Cross Platform (runs only on windows, unless you get a host running 
chilisoft and that's expensive from what i hear)
You have to pay for your database (unless your site is small and can use an 
access database)
Windows hosting is usually more expensive than unix hosting
Syntax is well HORRIBLE (personal opinion)
Not Object Oriented, Not as easy to expand in the future

I guess it all comes down to whether the client is going to use ASP 3.0 (old 
style) or .NET If they are going with ASP 3.0 the above should say why PHP 
towers over ASP. However i do not have much experience with .NET aside from 
knowing the following.

ASP.NET--
Hosting costs are usually higher since it has to run on windows (unless you 
program the site in C# and run mono on a unix box) 
It's not cross platform, the database you use you will have to pay for 
(unless the site is small and can run an access database)

ASP.NET++
Comes packed with built in classes (All Object Oriented)
Can use any .NET compliant language, even mix the pages with different 
languages (VB.NET <http://VB.NET>, C#, J#, i hear delphi is working on .net 
or has released one.) When i say mix languages i know one page can use VB 
and another can use C# but as for mixing languages in one file i dont think 
you can do that.

You probably have a shared hosting environment, where other websites are 
being hosted on your server too, right?

I think this has even been addressed earlier in this thread, but here it is 
again.  The PHP interpreter doesn't distinguish between sessions pertaining 
to different sites hosted on the same server.  It treats all sessions 
equally, and wipes them out after the specified time period.  So:

Situation A:
--You have session lifetime set high
--Someone else hosted on server has it set to default lifetime
Result: all sessions get wiped after 24 minutes

Situation B:
--You have session lifetime set to 1 minute
--Someone else hosted on server has it set to default lifetime
Result: all sessions get wiped after 1 minute, all other users hosted on 
that server start posting to newsgroups that their sessions are only 
lasting one minute and they don't know what is wrong

I think if you change the session save path to someplace not shared with 
other users (but the webserver has to be able to read and write to it), 
you'll be okay.

Well, it sounds like you're wanting:

SELECT number
FROM   numbers

That will give you the values in the number column. Of course, you can't 
have three values in a single row when you only have two columns, so I 
might not be answering you correctly. If so, can you clarify?

One word: IIS

(You can run ASP stuff in Apache, but I can't imagine that's a good 
choice either.)

I'm a big PHP fan, but the choice should come down to programmer
experience and the technology infrastructure.

If they have Windows Servers, IIS, ASP.NET and Visual Studio (and
preferably SQL Server), the company has people experienced
maintaining them, and there isn't much of a likelihood that the
environment will change, then ASP can be a good choice.  I don't know
how well it plays with MySQL, though, but seems like it should.

I chose PHP over .NET from a cost perspective.  All of the MS
technologies above cost $$$, whereas many flavors of Linux, Apache,
PHP, MySQL and a good PHP editor/IDE (I use Eclipse and Subclipse)
can be had for free.

As far as I know, that cannot be done with a single query.  Your best 
bet is to query (SELECT number FROM numbers) then programatically get 
your results to the comma delimited format you want.  It can also be 
done using stored procedures if the database you are using supports 
stored procedures.

I would bet there is some really perverse virtuoso contortion you could do
involving concat() and sub-SELECTs, but yeah, go with doing it
programmatically.

Haiku, anyone?

Has anyone ever tried running MSIE under CrossOver Office? Really? How'd
it go?

The goal is to test pages in our old friend MSIE without having to reboot
a dual-boot system into Windows or run two computers. It would be nice
just to sit there and flip back and forth.

Thanks,

Hi Joseph,

While I am no fan of ASP or ASP.NET <http://ASP.NET> I did want to point out 
that, if someone did choose to use ASP they *can* interface with MySQL. It's 
not as easy as it is in PHP but it *is* an option. So, technically, one 
doesn't have to pay for the database.

It works, and is useful for checking pages provided they don't rely on plugins.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] fgetcsv alternatives?
Message-ID: <4D2FAD9B00577645932AD7ED5FECA24532526C@mail>

Hello Listies,

the basic call to fgetcsv looks like this:
array fgetcsv (int fp, int length) 

where:
"fp must be a valid file pointer to a file successfully opened by fopen(),
popen(), or fsockopen()"

I have a large buffer that I'd like to parse as CSV -- so is there a
function similar to fgetcsv() that could operate on a string buffer rather
than a filehandle?

Why not explode()?

<?
$lines = explode("\n", $buffer);
foreach ($lines as $line) {
    $fields = explode("\t", $line);
}
?>

Wellington,

This isn't the most efficient function in the world, but it will get the 
job done and can handle embedded newlines and other CSV oddities.

Dan

function csv_parse($str,$f_delim = ',',$r_delim = "\n",$qual = '"')
{
   $output = array();
   $row = array();
   $word = '';

   $len = strlen($str);
   $inside = false;

   $skipchars = array($qual,'\\');

   for ($i = 0; $i < $len; ++$i) {
     $c = $str[$i];
     if (!$inside && $c == $f_delim) {
       $row[] = $word;
       $word = '';
     } elseif (!$inside && $c == $r_delim) {
       $row[] = $word;
       $word = '';
       $output[] = $row;
       $row = array();
     } else if ($inside && in_array($c,$skipchars) && ($i+1 < $len && 
$str[$i+1] == $qual)) {
       $word .= $qual;

     } else if ($c == $qual) {
       $inside = !$inside;
     } else {
       $word .= $c;
     }
   }

   $row[] = $word;
   $output[] = $row;

   return $output;
}

Because CSV is more complex than that -- delimiter characters that are
actually data, the escaping of text qualifier characters, etc.

Dan,

This looks great, though I haven't tried it. Thanks!

I was also hoping, and just kinda curious, if there were some way of
treating a buffer as a filehandle, since I could see that coming in handy.

Thanks again!

Can you write the buffer to a temp file, read it back in with 
fgetcsv, and then delete the temp file?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP5/Apache problems after FC4 upgrade
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0508231457160.72600@emra.pair.com>


Foolish me, just upgraded from Fedora Core 3 to 4 (with CDs, choosing
"Upgrade" rather than fresh install).

Now Apache can't start, and the error is

Syntax error on line 223 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/libphp5.so into server: libssl.so.4:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

Not really understanding what I am doing, I figure, let's just try
re-compiling and re-installing first Apache, then PHP. Apache went fine.
With PHP 5.0.4, 'make' pukes the following:

grep: /usr/lib/libxml2.la: No such file or directory
/bin/sed: can't read /usr/lib/libxml2.la: No such file or directory
libtool: link: `/usr/lib/libxml2.la' is not a valid libtool archive
make: *** [libphp5.la] Error 1

And /usr/lib contains:

You probably have a shared hosting environment, where other websites are
being hosted on your server too, right?

I think this has even been addressed earlier in this thread, but here it is
again.  The PHP interpreter doesn't distinguish between sessions pertaining
to different sites hosted on the same server.  It treats all sessions
equally, and wipes them out after the specified time period.  So:

Situation A:
--You have session lifetime set high
--Someone else hosted on server has it set to default lifetime
Result: all sessions get wiped after 24 minutes

Situation B:
--You have session lifetime set to 1 minute
--Someone else hosted on server has it set to default lifetime
Result: all sessions get wiped after 1 minute, all other users hosted on
that server start posting to newsgroups that their sessions are only
lasting one minute and they don't know what is wrong

I think if you change the session save path to someplace not shared with
other users (but the webserver has to be able to read and write to it),
you'll be okay.

Thanks for suggestions, but this is not the case, I am experienced php
programmer and aware with all these possible situation which can this
problem. Although we are running different different websites, we have only
single httpd.conf file where everything is hosted and I have set higher
session time out value in that file only, so no other wiste is overridding
it. I have also checked whether "atime" is enabled for session directory or
not. And it is enabled. There is not even any other cron etc. script that
can empty "/tmp" folder after regualr interval. I know most of reason where
session time out may not work properly, but I have checked all of them and
none of them is causing this problem.

Sorry, I just forgot to mention these in my post, otherwise you could have
though in different directions.

I take a more pragmatic approach.  
PHP 5  :  Wired . . . 
ASP :  BOOOORING . . . 

I think if you want to just get it done, you can do find no better
tool then PHP.  If you want to learn a new language, you can spend all
your time freed up by the PHP solution and explore Ruby, Python,
Swing, et al.

The ASP solutions (s) (in my limited experience) have about zero sex
appeal. However I'm sure if you put the time into it, you can build
some pretty good software using an all Windows based environment, if
that's your target.

I think Microsoft lucked out with the web.  But I don't see them
getting on to Web 2.0 any time soon. __ not in their corporate rule
book (at least not yet).

Just my 2 rupee's

-ed  :-)

Message-ID: <37590.38.117.147.25.1124890054.squirrel@38.117.147.25>

I can tell you why I tried ASP.Net and why I eventually walked away from it.

First, cross-platform is big, it had to run on Linux.  But I had to work
out some basic ideas first about the app and I had no knowledge of Linux
dev tools, while I was very comfortable with Windows, so this made
anything .Net the easiest way to get started.

So I put .net onto the Win2k laptop, installed MSDN and got started with
the tutorials.  Built the basic 3-tier and 4-tier model of a basic
application.  Then started working through my own ideas.

The first trouble I ran into was how difficult it was to code manually. If
you don't use the IDE it is nigh near impossible to grind out the simplest
page.  There is a huge overhead of declarations, namespaces and binding to
work out.  This is a problem because as I get older I am much less
impressed with complexity and really like simple programs that are easy to
read and understand on sight.  But so far I withheld judgement and kept
looking at it.

The next trouble was dynamic database connections.  In my systems users
connect as who they are, not using an aliased generic connection.  In PHP
I can create a connection on-the-fly using session variables and work with
it, while ASP.Net wants a gazillion different objects before you execute
your first SELECT statement.  Programmatically changing the connection to
log in as somebody else did not seem to be something they were expecting
anybody to do.  I found nothing easy about dragging and dropping 3 or 4
objects around and setting all kinds of properties (that i could then not
change dynamically) compared to this:

$conn = pg_connect("host=1.2.3.4 dbname=.... etc)

The IDE would do extremely perverse things to your page.  If you went in
and tried to monkey with the HTML, the editor inserts line breaks and
spacing that appear to be deliberately obfuscating the page.  This made it
very frustrating to work through what was going on.

At this point I was still getting useful work done prototyping the actual
project, so I still pressed forward.  However, the tide of opinion had
changed and I was, as you might say, looking for trouble.

The deal-killer turned out to be the very foundation of ASP.Net, what i
believe really makes it bad, its concept of the 'code-behind' page that
stores processing code separate from HTML code.  This is the biggest
departure from original ASP, it is what also truly distinguishes ASP.Net
from PHP, and it is what makes ASP really really bad.  The problems are:

1) It makes it very difficult to create completely dynamic pages.

2) You've got two pages no matter what (AFAICR), even when you don't need
that kind of complexity.

3) It hides the details of execution flow and actually denies you access
to those details.  If you have ever seen the horrors of what happens when
a programmer is shielded from architecture realities, you will appreciate
the kind of resource hogs this is going to create.  While it is clever to
allow a programmer to put server-side event code in for a single control,
it is also lunacy to execute round trips on these events.  PHP requires
you to know about the architecture so that you can code it right.

Now, compare this to PHP, which meets the first requirement for
programming: if the computer can do it, PHP can do it.  But it also meets
the second requirement: Don't fluff it up, just do the job!  ASP.Net has, 
to put it mildly, a lot of fluff.  PHP has so far is OO-sane, it provides
OO without requiring it.  That sums up the entire PHP experience regarding
almost everything, it provides it and supports it but does not require it.

Does anyone have any experience with setting the MaxRequestsPerChild

Have you ever set MaxRequestsPerChild to another value. If so what number

I want to limit the amount of resources kept in use, and want child

Yes.

1024 but if you like to burn cpu cycles starting new httpd processes
you can set it as low as 1, eh? It's up to you.

If it's an unfixable memory leak you are concerned about, that will do
it. But of course you know you're treating the symptom, not the
problem.

This list is probably 95% programmers who actually code PHP on a daily basis.  

In some companies, .NET vs LAMP technology decisions are made by
managers who don't program.  They purchase research reports and read
white papers and browse marketing brochures.

Rarely - set it to 10000 on occaision...

I only did it because of instability with some Oracle client libs that PHP
was linked against.  That was about 4 years ago, and I haven't done it again
since.  Generally, setting it higher than zero isn't needed, but you could
set it to 10k or something (on a moderate trafficed site) for paranoic
reasons (or, perhaps, if you're on Solaris or another UNIX that isn't as
popular).

Not aware of something that would provide this functionality on a per
directory basis.  Of course you can set the limit on a server wide basis,
but if you want to track how many people are in a directory, you may need
some PHP magic.

I've noticed mysql "Duplicate entry" error after accidental 
system power down. It occurs for an auto increment primary key. 
Do you know how can I avoid it?

Corrupted tables, likely MyISAM.  Run CHECK TABLE/myisamchk

Ultimately, I found two available Apache mods called mod_throttle and
mod_bandwidth that can selectively throttle Apache. The documentation of
mod_bandwidth clearly showed it could throttle by directory and/or virtual
sites.

But I am instead first attempting to resolve my situation with more basic
techniques: Tuning Apache. Tuning MySQL. Building a slow-query log. Getting
more RAM (as it is actually called for). Revisiting the PHP code.

I can't find enough third-party endorsement of these throttling mods to go
right ahead with them.

Gracias compa?ero.

Not aware of something that would provide this functionality on a per
directory basis.  Of course you can set the limit on a server wide basis,
but if you want to track how many people are in a directory, you may need
some PHP magic.

Thanks guys. Maybe I will give wine a shot first since it's easier on the
wallet. I've heard it can be a bit of a beast to figure out but I suppose
I'll see for myself.

FWIW, here is how I muddled through, in case somebody else one day is
desperate enough to follow suit. I have minimal expertise in solving build
errors, so if I don't find a solution here or from Mr Google, I just have
to beat my head against it until it works.

My ./configure includes --with-xml and --with-xsl. I was getting compile
errors about libxml2.la not being a valid libtool archive. I tried mucking
around with /usr/lib/libxml2.la and manually re-building libxml2, and for
my trouble I got something like 'libxml2.la seems to have moved.' When I
left these configure options out it worked fine. But I didn't want that so
I finally

* removed and reinstalled libxml2 via yum. yum erased several other
packages that depended on it so I re-installed these after re-installing
libxml2

* rm -rf /path/to/php-5.0.4 source directory resulting from unpacking
php-5.0.4.tar.gz.

* unpacked tarball and did ./configure [...], make, make install once
again.

HTH somebody.

Generally speaking, running "make distclean" should have the effect of
removing the source tree and unpacking, and should be quicker.

It can do both, depending on the options.

That's probably the right approach.  Of course everything depends on
hardware and your traffic pattern, but so often the database/PHP processing
can be the bottleneck that's it's good to check pressure points in that area
first.

I've worked more with mod_throttle than mod_bandwidth.  I'd say it's more
active, but it's just a educated guess from a couple of experiences in the
past.

Hiya,

If you're over on WWWAC you've already seen this but I'm asking here
from another slant. I have no idea what I can or can't do withOUT
having to create/manage a mySQL db...my server will let me do this
easily enough but it's been over a year since I've thought of PHP or
mySQL and I don't want to get so distracted by the programming
mindset that I forget what I was doing in the first place (trying to
do some marketing).

Below is the process I'm trying to implement - step 5 is where I'm
fuzzy...I know I could definitely have the URL come back to a
PHP page that looks up the string in a db (and a very simple one,
I'm sure, since it's just a list) but I'd rather just have the URL come
back to the Flash file and do the checking from within the .swf,
with ActionScript - is that easier or harder? Since you guys all love
PHP and probably only half of you even like AS, I know it's a biased
answer I'll get :-) but try to be objective and not play favorites
on the languages here.

What I want to do:

(1) user gives me email address

(2) with a PHP script (free from http://www.allhype.co.uk/tools/md5/
and a very nice script actually!!) I MD5 their email address

(3) I send user a message (to validate the address works) that has
their MD5'd address as a link for them to come back and get what
they want

(4) user clicks unique query string in the email I've sent them

(4) I validate the string .....how/from where is the ??? :)

(5) if valid, give them the Flash file; if not, give them an error message

Any help much appreciated!

You could do all of this with just Flash, etc. assuming Flash has MD5, as
I'm sure it does, but you'll be limited. If you want to track who has
downloaded what files, the browser they're using, etc. you won't be able to
do so without a DB.

There's also a security concern here. There's no way to know that the email
address you've gotten originally, is the same as the one that's coming from
the link. Since you're not storing anything anywhere, you have no way to
keep persistent data. If I know that you're checking that an MD5 matches
the MD5 of the email address, I can pass you any MD5 I want, and it'll
validate.

A bookmarked session id might not result in a hijacked session, but
it's not a good idea have session ids exposed and kept around like
that.

Consider another example: Someone is logged into a newspaper site and
sees an interesing article. The user copies the url (with session id)
and pastes it in an email to a friend. If the friend receives the
email quickly and the server has a long timeout, accidential session
hijacking could occur.

The primary reason to have a session id in the url is if the browser
doesn't support cookies, right?

I think you have the purpose of the MD5 hash confused. In this case,
you want it to be an *unguessable* token that the user can bring back
to you to prove that they got they got your validation message, and
that they own the mailbox associated with the provided email address.

In other words, it should be random. If it's just the hash of their
email address, then an impersonator could easily generate the right
token and validate an address that isn't their own (as Hans pointed
out).

You will need some sort of DB -- MySQL or flat file or otherwise -- to
store the email address and the random token in the same record, so
that when the user clicks the link with the token in it, you can look
up the email and mark it valid.

Hiya,

If you're over on WWWAC you've already seen this but I'm asking here
from another slant. I have no idea what I can or can't do withOUT
having to create/manage a mySQL db...my server will let me do this
easily enough but it's been over a year since I've thought of PHP or
mySQL and I don't want to get so distracted by the programming
mindset that I forget what I was doing in the first place (trying to
do some marketing).

Below is the process I'm trying to implement - step 5 is where I'm
fuzzy...I know I could definitely have the URL come back to a
PHP page that looks up the string in a db (and a very simple one,
I'm sure, since it's just a list) but I'd rather just have the URL come
back to the Flash file and do the checking from within the .swf,
with ActionScript - is that easier or harder? Since you guys all love
PHP and probably only half of you even like AS, I know it's a biased
answer I'll get :-) but try to be objective and not play favorites
on the languages here.

What I want to do:

(1) user gives me email address

(2) with a PHP script (free from http://www.allhype.co.uk/tools/md5/
and a very nice script actually!!) I MD5 their email address

(3) I send user a message (to validate the address works) that has
their MD5'd address as a link for them to come back and get what
they want

(4) user clicks unique query string in the email I've sent them

(4) I validate the string .....how/from where is the ??? :)

(5) if valid, give them the Flash file; if not, give them an error message

Any help much appreciated!

You could do all of this with just Flash, etc. assuming Flash has MD5, as
I'm sure it does, but you'll be limited. If you want to track who has
downloaded what files, the browser they're using, etc. you won't be able to
do so without a DB.

There's also a security concern here. There's no way to know that the email
address you've gotten originally, is the same as the one that's coming from
the link. Since you're not storing anything anywhere, you have no way to
keep persistent data. If I know that you're checking that an MD5 matches
the MD5 of the email address, I can pass you any MD5 I want, and it'll
validate.

Morning  Rinaldy:

The problem you are having is most likely to do with directory/file
permissions on the access database.  If you have control of the webserver
than you need to use windows explorer and give write permissions to the
directory and to the access database .mdb and .ldb.  If you are not in
control of the webserver you will need to ask your hosting provider to
update the permissions.  I have run into this problem a number of times when
using access databases for web development.  Hope this helps.

This is a discussion list for the PHP language.  Because you are using ASP, 
you need a discussion list for that language.  Try http://aspadvice.com/

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Operation must use an updateable query.
In-Reply-To: <20050826100109.53275.qmail@web52715.mail.yahoo.com>
References: <20050826100109.53275.qmail@web52715.mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <430F64FE.1010100@gmail.com>

Even though this is a PHP discussion list this problem has a quick 
enough answer for me to offer an answer here.

The most probable cause is that the IUSER account doesn't have modify or 
update permissions on the folder the database is in. Make sure IUSER has 
the right permissions on the folder and try again. This will probably 
solve your problem.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Operation must use an updateable query.
References: <20050826100109.53275.qmail@web52715.mail.yahoo.com>
	<430F64FE.1010100@gmail.com>

I think  Anthony is right..!!!!

Cause
This error usually happens on Windows NT, Windows 2000 or Windows XP and may 
be caused by any of the following conditions:
- the database file or database folder doesn't have necessary security 
permissions to write to, or erase an .ldb file created by Microsoft Access 
when opening the database
- the database file doesn't have sufficient security permissions or write 
permissions to be modified when updating data in it. The web browser is seen 
by the web server as a Internet User that has the server account IUSR. This 
user needs to have write permission to the database file and to the database 
folder.
Resolution
Follow these steps to resolve this issue:
1. Use Windows Explorer to find the folder on the disk, which contains the 
database file (.mdb). This is usually your project folder.
2. Right-click on the project folder and select Properties.
3. Uncheck the Read-only property.
4. Click on the Security tab in the properties window.
(Attention: If you don't see such tab (Windows XP), close the properties 
window, open any folder, select Tools -> Folder Options -> View, and uncheck 
the option Use simple file sharing.)
5. Click Add and find, then select the user IUSR_<COMPUTERNAME>.
6. Select the Write checkbox in the Allow; column to assign Write 
permissions to the IUSR account.

Even though this is a PHP discussion list this problem has a quick
enough answer for me to offer an answer here.

The most probable cause is that the IUSER account doesn't have modify or
update permissions on the folder the database is in. Make sure IUSER has
the right permissions on the folder and try again. This will probably
solve your problem.

Rinaldy,

Again, this is not an appropriate place for ASP questions.  Please do not 
post them here (those who do have answers should send them off list as 
well).

And in the future, if you do have PHP related issues similar to this, at a 
minimum please consult Google before asking for help.

This is pretty basic, but may help you until some one get's you the slides:

If you are on Windows (WAMP or XAMPP et al) there is an error in the 
wiki, so beware. It looks pretty obvious, but I didn't document the fix 
so I didn't update the wiki and can't provide step-by-step right now..

If you follow the instructions to edit php.ini and htppd.doc and the 
eclipse confi all is ok except in one place they have you specifically 
load a version-number-named php dll and later they specify  a generic 
php dll (which obviously doesn't exist so you get an error).

Again sorry for no positive specifics but at least with this quick reply 
you know there is a small issue.

Follow the instructions here:

http://phpeclipse.de/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=23

This installation uses Eclipse with webtools, then a software update for PHP.

PHPEclipse (and Eclipse with webtools) are definitely improving and
looking quite nice!  6-12 months ago PHPEclipse was a little buggy.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Dynamic Forms and Form Handlers
Message-ID: <40fcda73050830081433887206@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on a small project for my employer to collect data from clients. 
Although most of the fields are shared between all projects, there are 
slight variations (not every client has departments, or employee ids). To 
accomodate that, I need to be able to add/remove HTML fields on project 
basis. I would like NOT having to update both the HTML forms and php form 
handlers manually every time. Does anyone know of a barebone framework which 
will allow me to create such forms and form handlers? Or if you know of any 
resources which I can consult, that'll help.

I think I can figure it out on my own, but it'll take longer than the time I 
have been given.

Thanks.

Just a thought:  You could subclass HTML_QuickForm and have its
constructor add all the elements you expect to be common to all the forms
you will need. Then instances of your subclass can remove/add additional
elements as needed.

The slides don't cover installation, but I will be writing some stuff up to supplement them (and the slides should be on line this week).

Basically installation is just a matter of unzipping the PHPEclipse zip file into the Eclipse directory.  However, be sure to have WTP installed first, which also requires some pre-installation of other plug-ins (which you can use Eclipse's Software Update facility in the Help menu for).

Best,

Perhaps a dumb question, can anyone recommend an effective way to restrict
direct access to an images subdirectory?  Specifically, I would like to
serve up images _only_ through .php scripts on the server, not directly via

Put an .htaccess in the directory so that you can't browse to it at all, 
and have php include() the file in the web page directly? Or read it in 
and print it out?

maybe?

Depending on speed requirements you can insert the binary data of an 
image in a database or restricted area of the filesystem and have a php 
script retrieve the image.
Your html would look like this
<img src="getimage.php?image_number=1324">
This is often used for tracking.

If you just want directory listing prevented use .htaccess of apache to 
shut off the option for indexes.

a) put the images directory outside the web tree.

b) create a file named ".htaccess" in the directory with this line of text 
in it: "Deny from all".

Perhaps a dumb question, can anyone recommend an effective way to restrict
direct access to an images subdirectory?  Specifically, I would like to
serve up images _only_ through .php scripts on the server, not directly via
a URL....

Forgive if I'm wrong, but I believe you'll need to open the image
data, send the correct http header so the browser will render it
correctly, along with the actual data following the header.

You could use the display/visibility style attribute to show or hide fields. eg. make a decision in Javascript or PHP to set this attribute for each field - just wrap each field in a DIV tag with an ID.

Just a thought:??You could subclass HTML_QuickForm and have its
constructor add all the elements you expect to be common to all the forms 
you will need. Then instances of your subclass can remove/add additional
elements as needed.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Partial Name Lookup Function in PEAR
Message-ID: <20050901010551.48E98A863E@virtu.nyphp.org>

Does PEAR offer a partial name lookup function?  What is the best way to do
a partial name lookup in a database-independent manner?  If I must drop back
to hard-coded MySQL calls, is the LOCATE() function the appropriate one to
use in this situation?

Any responses will be appreciated, including advice to direct these
questions to another list.

 I do not know about PEAR but if you are just trying to look up a first or last name (or anything other name/text) using only a partial piece of information the LIKE command is best.
 
SELECT "column" FROM "table" WHERE "column_name" LIKE [PATTERN] 
 
ie.
 
SELECT * FROM pics WHERE pic_name LIKE '%ANG%'
 
This would return all pic_name where ANG is contained in the string.
