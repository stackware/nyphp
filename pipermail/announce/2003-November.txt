Subject: [nycphp-announce] November's Meeting - Show off your site
Message-ID: <3FB16229.7070505@nyphp.org>


Hi all,

For the November meeting we're looking to showcase sites from the NYPHP community, and I'm looking for volunteers who'd like to show off a site they've been involved with.  If you have an interesting, fairly unique, or success story that involves AMP Technology, please contact me at noreply at nyphp.org.  We plan on having 3-4 sites demonstrated at November's meeting and this is a great chance to show your or your company's handy work.  Presentations are expected to be kept fairly short (15 minutes) and will be informal.  Even if it's just a fun site, we'd love to hear about it!


Thank you,

Hans Zaunere

Subject: [nycphp-announce] PHundamentals Topic #4 - php.ini settings on NYPHP
	Talk
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20031112153009.00b51650@mail.optonline.net>

PHundamentals topic #4 - php.ini settings is up for discussion on NYPHP's 
Talk mailing list.

If you are already a member of Talk, you will have seen it already, and you 
can stop reading now.

If you are not a member of Talk but would like to participate, you may sign 
up at http://nyphp.org/lists . Do not even attempt to discuss it on the 
Announce list; your message will just go into a black hole.  For reference, 
here is the notice:
=====================
Settings in the php.ini file have an important
effect on the operation, security and reliability of your application.
For example, setting register_globals to a value of "on" makes it easier to
pass variables from one script to another, but opens serious security
vulnerabilities--so best practice is always to set it "off."

What settings do you consider essential?  How should they be set, and why?

In next month's PHundamentals, we'll discuss how to manage these settings 
most effectively.

Subject: [nycphp-announce] next@nyphp: November General Meeting,
 AMP Certifications, Books for Reviews Available
Message-ID: <3FBA1C6B.9010908@nyphp.org>


---- November Meeting Program ----

Wouldn't it be interesting to see what your fellow PHP developers are working on?

At this month's General Meeting, we have four PHP driven sites from the NYPHP community. Each developer highlights the interesting points in development, challenges they've faced, and how they made it happen with PHP.  Join us for:

-- Investment Accounting
-- www.bikesummer.org/2003/
-- jimslobsterco.com
-- maxcards.com

See http://nyphp.org for complete details about each site, directions and time.  As always this meeting is free and open to the public - and please be sure to RSVP by sending a message to rsvp at nyphp.org.


---- Rapid AMP Certifications ----

Concise, intense, skill-centric; RAMP Certifications now available.
Details at http://nyphp.org/ramp


---- Book Review Reminder; More Free Books Available ----

Get hot book titles, free!  Help the community and authors by writing a
brief review of the books.  And these aren't book reviews like you did
in high school - just a couple of paragraphs and an overall critique
is perfect!  Thanks to NYPHP developer Peter Lehrer, we now have a site
for members to request and pickup books for review.  For a sample
review, more information and to request a book for October, please
see: http://nyphp.org/library

For those with books already, get your review sent into
library at nyphp.org, and sign-up for more great titles.

And, if there's a book not in our list that you'd like to review, tell
us at library at nyphp.org! 



---- Online Web Forums ----

We've received numerous requests for providing additional resources to
the community through online web forums, and have answered with
http://forums.nyphp.org and forums at nyphp.org.

makes available. Please see http://nyphp.org/phpmag for details.
