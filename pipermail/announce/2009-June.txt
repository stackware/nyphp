Message-ID: <000001c9e56b$71bca6a0$5535f3e0$@com>

New York PHP Managing Member Hans Zaunere and Member Gennady Feldman will be
presenting to the Web Performance Meetup on June 16th.  Topic details are
below and RSVP (required) is available at the Web Performance meeting site.

Registration:

PHP + DB, Hans Zaunere
All modern web sites require persistent data storage and manipulation.  New
York PHP Managing Member Hans Zaunere will review common bottlenecks and
best practices for keeping PHP and the database speedy and reliable.
Although we'll talk specifically on MySQL, we'll also learn how these
concepts are relevant for any database and the roll memcached has in keeping
your web sites flying.

PHP code profiling using XDebug, Gennady Feldman
Xdebug is a very powerful PHP extension that should be in the toolbox of any
PHP developer. In this quick presentation we will do a quick introduction
into some of the things Xdebug is capable of and what it can do for you.
We'll cover a number of Xdebug features like remote debugging and code
profiling. Forget those print and echo statements as your debugging aids.
Gennady will share some tips and tricks (time permitting) of how to be a
more efficient and productive PHP developer.

Front-end performance testing and optimizations, Sergey Chernyshev
PHP code is executed on the server, but site performance is usually affected
by many other factors as well and many of them are related to front end of
your applications.  Sergey Chernyshev, organizer of New York Web Performance
Meetup will talk about ways PHP web-developers can measure their web
application performance and what they can optimize to get good results
quickly.  He'll show how to see your bottlenecks and how to use browser
cache effectively and how this affects your PHP code.

Registration is required. For full details and to register visit the meetup

	(RIAs) with Silverlight & PHP
Message-ID: <010b01c9ef54$7229c080$567d4180$@com>

June General Meeting:
Building Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) with Silverlight & PHP
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, June 23rd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

Even though Mother Nature may not know it's June, it is, and time for our
June meeting.  We'll welcome back Peter Laudati and Microsoft, to give us a
refreshing "summer" refresher on the Silverlight and PHP play.

In March 2007, Microsoft introduced Silverlight to the market as a new
platform for developing rich internet applications. Silverlight is a
cross-browser, cross-platform, and cross-device plug-in for delivering the
next generation of media experiences and rich interactive applications for
the Web. By using various tools, designers and developers can collaborate
more effectively using the skills they have today to light up the Web of
tomorrow. Silverlight is a client-side technology with no dependencies on
the Microsoft web stack (.NET). Therefore, it can be a perfect complement to
PHP applications.

Come join us as we take a tour around Silverlight, including its
capabilities, how to develop Silverlight applications, and the tools used.
We'll also talk about how you can use Silverlight together with PHP to take
user experiences to the next level!

And join us at TGI Friday's at 56th and Lexington after the meeting for FREE
food and drink, thanks to Microsoft.

Peter Laudati is a Developer Evangelist with Microsoft. In his current role,
Peter works with the developer community in New York and New Jersey to
support area user groups, code camps, and other events. Previously, he
worked as a consultant in Microsoft's services division. As a consultant, he
worked on several application development projects and provided
architectural guidance for large customers throughout the NY & NJ metro
area. He lives with his family in central New Jersey and loves kayaking and
biking at the Jersey Shore. His blog can be read at
http://www.peterlaudati.com.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles.

 When: Tuesday, June 23rd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php
