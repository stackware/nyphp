Join New York PHP in this year's pre-Thanksgiving feast of AMP Technology. An AMD System Engineer will be examining AMP Technology and the AMD64 platform. Stop by our IBM location to see how 64bits can crank AMP up.

AMP Technology and the AMD 64 Architecture

With AMD engineer David O'Brien, we'll examine the advantages and nuances of working with AMP and open source on the new AMD 64 platform.

As a primer for the presentation, New York PHP is working with AMD to understand the best methods for deploying AMP on this exciting new hardware platform. 32bit is so very last decade, and thanks to NYPHP's Michael DeWitt and representatives from AMD, we've been testing AMP Technology on a complimentary dual AMD64 server.

New York PHP's President and Founder, Hans Zaunere, is working with the PHP-Internal list and discussing getting PHP up to par on lib64 systems. See Zends digest for the work Hans and others have been doing on taking AMP to the 64 bit platform.

As part of this NYPHP initiative, Hans has been documenting the complete steps, pitfalls, and gotchas of deploying AMP to lib64 platforms, including operating system installation notes for SuSE and Red Hat. Part of NYPHP's soon to be announced AMPeers project, he'll be publishing detailed articles and sharing his experiences on how to deploy on this next generation platform.

Don't be left behind; learn how you can shatter 32bit limitations and be prepared for the next generation of hardware.

Enjoy turkey in two days, but save room beforehand for AMD &amp; AMP.

Platinum sponsor IBM has provided a great room with seating for plenty.

        When: November 23rd, 2004 at 6:30pm *sharp*
       Where: 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th floor)
Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th

Join us after the meeting for good food and discussion!

As always this meeting is free and open to the public.
