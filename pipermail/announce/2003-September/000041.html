--- New Meeting Program, tonight! ---

New York PHP has organized an exciting new lineup for our general monthly meetings. Each meeting includes a monthly review of previous PHundamental Threads (<A HREF="http://nyphp.org/content/calendar/view_entry.php?id=36&amp;pass">http://nyphp.org/content/calendar/view_entry.php?id=36&amp;pass</A>), a technique or product demo, and a feature presentation. We will be starting at 6:30pm sharp, so please arrive on time.

September 23rd, 2003 @ 6:30pm (sharp) at Digital Pulp, Inc.

6:30 PHundamental Threads
-- Join NYPHP developer Jeff Knight for discussion, review and Q&amp;A on this month's thread, &quot;Site Structure.&quot;

6:45 Product/Technique/Special Feature
-- NYPHP VP Daniel Kushner shows the exciting new features in Zend Studio 3. And, meeting attendees receive a 50% discount on Studio 3!

7:00 Feature Presentation
-- &quot;A Tale of Three Templates&quot;
Lead by NYPHP members Chris Snyder, Daniel Kushner and Hans Zaunere, see how the different templating solutions compare. Chris looks at the powerful Smarty engine, Daniel examines the pure PHPLIB implementation, and Hans maintains that PHP is a templating engine itself! The panel will examine three identical tasks, and compare each solution for performance, maintainability and development life-cycle.

7:45 Q&amp;A and Recap
-- Join us for open Q&amp;A, including dinner and drinks after the meeting.


As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting and location details at <A HREF="../../../index.html">http://nyphp.org</A> - and please be sure to RSVP by sending a message to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">rsvp at nyphp.org.</A>
