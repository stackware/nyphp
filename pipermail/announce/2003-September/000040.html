--- Free books, direct from the publishers ---

Get hot book titles, free!  Help the community and authors by writing a brief review of the books.  And these aren't book reviews like you did in high school - just a couple of paragraphs and an overall critique is perfect!  Thanks to NYPHP developer Peter Lehrer, we now have a site for members to request and pickup books for review.  For a sample review, more information and to request a book for September, please see: <A HREF="http://nyphp.org/library">http://nyphp.org/library</A>

And, if there's a book not in our list that you'd like to review, tell us at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">library at nyphp.org</A>!


--- New Meeting Program ---

New York PHP has organized an exciting new lineup for our general monthly meetings.  Each meeting includes a monthly review of previous PHundamental Threads (<A HREF="http://nyphp.org/content/calendar/view_entry.php?id=36&amp;pass">http://nyphp.org/content/calendar/view_entry.php?id=36&amp;pass</A>), a technique or product demo, and a feature presentation.  We will be starting at 6:30pm sharp, so please arrive on time.  

September 23rd, 2003 @ 6:30pm (sharp) at Digital Pulp, Inc.

6:30  PHundamental Threads

7:00  Feature Presentation
  --  &quot;A Tale of Three Templates&quot;
      Lead by NYPHP members Chris Snyder, Daniel Kushner and Hans Zaunere, see how the different templating solutions compare.

--- NYCwireless and The Downtown Alliance to Co-Sponsor The Wireless Park Lab Days ---

Media Contact: Dana Spiegel, NYCwireless, (917) 402-0422, <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">dana at nycwireless.net</A>

New York City, NY - September 19-20, 2003 - NYCwireless and the Downtown Alliance will co-sponsor The Wireless Park Lab Days, a two-day event that celebrates the availability of open wireless (Wi-Fi) networks in Lower Manhattan and explores their implications for art, community, and shared space. Produced by Dana Spiegel of NYCwireless, and artists Brooke Singer and Yury Gitman, Wireless Park Lab Days will be held in City Hall Park, the most popular &quot;hotspot&quot; in the Lower Manhattan Wireless Network, each day from 12 noon to 4pm.

The event is an innovative exhibition of new wireless art that features a &quot;new user&quot; area designed to help people become acquainted with the technology, and NodeRunner, the critically acclaimed wireless scavenger hunt that was recently awarded an Arts Electronica Golden Nica. The Wireless Park Lab Days will exhibit a wide-range of projects: PeopleWatching translates a typical park activity into an online arena, Public Broadcast Cart gives a very public voice to remote visitors, Bass-Station transforms a 1970s style boom box into an open juke box accessible to the public through a wireless connection. The New User Area will be staffed with experts in wireless computing from NYCwireless, who will help people get online and better understand Wi-Fi technology. The event will close on Saturday with a fun, interactive  round of the group game NodeRunner.
