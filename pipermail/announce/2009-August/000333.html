August General Meeting:
Xdebug from A to X
-----------------------

 When: Tuesday, August 25th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>
  Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th

A as in August and X as in Xdebug. Written by core developer Derick Rethans,
Xdebug has grown to be a powerful toolset for both the savvy and new PHP
developer. This month we're pleased to have power user Gennady Feldman speak
on making the most with Xdebug.

Xdebug is a Swiss army knife of PHP extensions and a must have for any PHP
developer and provides invaluable functionality out of the box. We'll cover
some of Xdebug's greatest and often overlooked features, as well as its best
known value as a profiler and debugger. Gennady will also share some of his
personal tips and tricks for getting the most out of Xdebug, including how
to find where your performance bottlenecks are and tracking down where a
particular function gets called and/or included from.

Gennady has been programming since the age of thirteen. He was always
fascinated with computers and trying to make them do cool stuff. Over the
years a personal hobby became a professional career and Gennady started
coding php over six years ago. Current challenges include learning best
practices, and finding answers to scalability and performance issues. In his
spare time Gennady is also an Open Source contributor. He has contributed to
BusyBox, Miranda IM and libyahoo2. Gennady also maintains a personal website
where people can download free software and read his blog. Gennady is also a
regular on the #phpc channel and tries his best to attend NYPHP and NYMySQL
user group meetings. The rest of the time is spent with his wife, family and
friends.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles and
jho
