Summer Networking Party and Joomla Gathering
--------------------------------------------
August 23rd at 6:30pm at The Delancey


August's dog days are here but relief is on the way.  NYCBUG and New York
PHP are excited to team up again for an informal summer networking event.

Even if you're not a member of these groups, you're invited.

At 6:30pm on August 23rd, we'll be getting together on the roof-top lounge
of The Delancey (http://www.thedelancey.com), in the Lower-East Side.  The
roof-top is a small piece of tropic serenity in Manhattan, with a relaxing
fountain, lush plants, and a great view - and of course WiFi.

There is no need to RSVP and all are invited to attend.  Just stop by 168
Delancey, between Clinton and Attorney, and head upstairs.

We hope you'll join us for this relaxing summer fling before Fall begins to
fall.


JOOMLA USERS: The New York PHP Community Joomla SIG will be having it's
first meeting at this event.  The meeting will serve as a way for people to
meet, greet, and decide the future direction of the SIG. And most
importantly, it'll be a great opportunity to finally meet the other Joomla
users and share war stories.

Join the Joomla mailing list
(http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla) to stay informed.

We're also looking forward to scheduling our fall meeting lineup.  If you
have ideas for a topic, or would like to speak yourself, please feel free to
submit or suggest a presentation.

	Framework
Message-ID: <02ab01c7e65f$fe0328d0$651ba8c0@MobileZ>


All,

We're looking to line-up our Fall presentation schedule, and we encourage
the community to present at our monthly meetings.

Submit or suggest a presentation - either for online presentation or
in-person:
http://www.nyphp.org/presentations.php


Special Event:
Zend's PHP and Framework
------------------------

 When: Wednesday, September 12th at 6:30pm
Where: Suspenders, 111 Broadway (lower level)
       http://www.suspendersbar.com/location.php
 RSVP: No RSVP Required


In this special event, we're pleased to host Mark de Visser and Matthew
Weier O'Phinney as they dive into Zend's enterprise PHP offerings and
up-and-coming framework.

NOTE: This meeting isn't a general meeting at IBM. It occurs September 12th,
at 6:30pm, in the lounge area of the Suspenders Bar and Grill. No RSVP is
required.

Building the PHP-stack for the enterprise
PHP has become ubiquitous when it comes to personal blogs, content
management systems, ecommerce sites and more. Take any list of Web 2.0 sites
and you'll find that more than 50% have PHP as back-end technology. What is
less known is that PHP is also making significant inroads in the enterprise.
In his presentation Mark de Visser will cover case studies of that trend,
and will discuss what drives the adoption and what still needs to be
accomplished. He will cover the role of Zend and other commercial vendors in
the PHP ecosystem, and will present a roadmap for the coming year of Zend's
main PHP products and services.

Zend Framework Overview
Zend Framework provides a high-quality open-source framework for developing
Web Applications and Web Services. By following the PHP spirit, the Zend
Framework delivers easy-to-use and powerful functionality, focusing on the
challenges of building robust, secure and modern Web applications. In this
overview, Matthew will detail Zend Framework goals and principles, as well
as several popular components.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

 When: Wednesday, September 12th at 6:30pm
Where: Suspenders, 111 Broadway (lower level)
       http://www.suspendersbar.com/location.php
 RSVP: No RSVP Required
