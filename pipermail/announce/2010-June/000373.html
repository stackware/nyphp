<PRE>June General Meeting:
PHP Development with Drupal Internals
Drupal internal architecture and coding examples and best practices
-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This month's meeting is not at IBM. Normal RSVP procedures still
apply.

         Date: June 22nd, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: Hive at 55, 55 Broad Street, New York, NY (13th Floor)
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/172">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/172</A> (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: Networking/drinks location to be announced at the meeting.

Many doubted it would happen, but it's here. Summer is in full swing and
with it comes the hot topic of Drupal. This June, join Forest Mars and the
ever-optimistic NYPHP group as we look at Drupal internals, architecture and
the PHP development practices that make it sultry enough even for our White
House (and join our Drupal mailing list at
<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/drupal">http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/drupal</A>).

IMPORTANT: This month's meeting is not at IBM. Normal RSVP procedures still
apply.

Join Forest Mars for a lively talk on the Drupal internals from the
perspective of php coding practices. Since Drupal implements very few true
OO classes (with methods, abstraction, etc.) the talk will cover how you
actually write php for it. We will be examining the underlying architecture,
using code examples to show how they implement the more abstract design
patterns Drupal uses and going over the hook system, as well as performance
tuning for Drupal.

Forest Mars is a Network Architect and Developer currently working on
implementing Hypermedia using the Drupal platform. Coming from a background
in Cybernetics and Information Theory, Forest Mars is known for his work as
the Architect of New York's first WiFi Internet Service Provider and the
&quot;Two Rooms&quot; of &quot;New York's Only Free Internet Cafe&quot; located in Manhattan's
East Village. He also serves as a board member of the Community Free
Software Group and Unigroup of New York.

This month's meeting space is provided by the Hive at 55
(<A HREF="http://www.hiveat55.com">http://www.hiveat55.com</A>). In cooperation with NYPHP, they are offering a
free trial of their affordable New York coworking office space, including
office amenities and conference rooms, in an entrepreneurial environment.
Email the Hive at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">hiveat55 at downtownny.com</A> for your free day and tell them
NYPHP sent you.
