Subject: [nycphp-announce] PHundamentals topic #4B - managing php.ini
	settings - is on NYPHP Talk
Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.2.20031201203357.01af4388@mail.optonline.net>

PHundamentals topic #4B - managing php.ini settings is up for discussion on 
NYPHP's Talk mailing list.

If you are already a member of Talk, you will have seen it already, and you 
can stop reading now.

If you are not a member of Talk but would like to participate, you may sign 
up at http://nyphp.org/lists . Do not even attempt to discuss it on the 
Announce list; your message will just go into a black hole.  For reference, 
here is the notice:
=====================
Last month's PHundamentals topic, what are the most important php.ini
settings, generated many good suggestions. Now we turn to managing
those settings.

On a server we control, that seems straightforward: we modify php.ini.
But we may also control some PHP settings using a <Directory> or
<Files> directive in httpd.conf, or in .htaccess. What is best
practice here?

And what is best practice on a server we don't control, where we have
access only to our own directories? How can we make certain that our
required settings are in effect?
