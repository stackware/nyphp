<PRE>September General Meeting:
The modx CMS and Framework
Rapid application development with flexible data models
-------------------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, September 28th, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: HIVE AT 55, 55 Broad Street, New York, NY, 10004
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/176">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/176</A> (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: Networking/drinks location to be announced at the meeting
(about 8pm)

As the briskness of Fall settles in, we welcome back Jayesh Sheth to present
an interesting framework, modx.

IMPORTANT: This month's meeting is NOT AT IBM. Normal RSVP procedures still
apply.

In PHP-land, there seem to be more content management systems than PHP
programmers. Out of all of the CMSs out there, why would you choose modx?

In this presentation, Jay Sheth will show you why modx is a beautifully
simple CMS that allows both designers and developers of all skill levels to
quickly create dynamic websites.

You'll see that modx is different because it allows the data model to be
customized using a web interface, and doesn't lock you in to a particular
programming paradigm or mindset.

In less than half an hour, via practical, real-world examples, you'll see
how, and why modx works. You'll get to know the difference between
resources, templates, template variables, snippets, and chunks. You'll also
learn how to use the modx manager web interface to administer your site, as
well as use the modx API to leverage modx's internals in powerful ways.
Finally, learn how to achieve high performance with modx by using modx's
built-in caching support.

Jay Sheth has been working with PHP for the past eight years, and is
passionate about building dynamic web applications. He currently works as a
senior web developer at Complex Magazine, where he gets to work with modx
every day. In his spare time, he loves to play the piano, or make a tasty
veggie burger (or three) with hummus.
