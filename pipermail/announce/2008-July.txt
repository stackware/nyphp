July General Meeting:
Ajax for PHP Developers
-----------------------

 When: Tuesday, July 22nd, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

This July, don't sweat Ajax. We're pleased to have Ajax/UI extraordinaire
and Central Florida PHP Founding Member, Michael Girouard, cover the
technical details of the Ajax/PHP relationship, and uncover the hype.

Ajax is a powerful tool that all web developers (front-end or back-end)
should be well versed in. Ajax applications are rich, responsive, and can
dramatically enhance the user experience. This talk will survey Ajax as a
technology for rich web applications and also will provide several practical
examples -- all from a PHP developer's perspective.

Mike Girouard is a front-end web developer living in New York City. As the
Sr. Developer at the creative agency Magnani Caruso Dutton, Mike takes pride
in his ability to introduce web-standards and beautiful code to industry
giants such as Discover and AT&T. In his off-time, he goes right back to his
editor and codes toward his latest open-source baby, Panda PHP Components.
You can read more about him and his other projects on his blog,
lovemikeg.com/blog.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

When: Tuesday, July 22nd, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
