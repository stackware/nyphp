Subject: [nycphp-announce] TOMORROW@nyphp: Preventing SQL Injection with PHP
Message-ID: <04fa01cc2455$581c94f0$0855bed0$@nyphp.org>

Special Event:
Preventing SQL Injection with PHP
Proper escaping with mysql, mysqli and PDO
------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, June 7th, 2011 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: Suspenders Restaurant, 111 Broadway (backroom, ask hostess)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/188 (all attendees MUST RSVP)

In the first game of NYPHP's doubleheader June, we welcome OWASP member and
ZCE Anthony Ferrara to speak on the subtle - yet vital - topic of SQL
escaping and it's evil cousin, SQL injection. Learn the inescapable
ins-and-outs of proper escaping, including when mysql_escape_string() is not
enough - plus an exclusive first look at a new attack vector, seen first
only at NYPHP.

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) lists SQL Injection as the #1
vulnerability risk to web based applications today. In fact, it's estimated
that as many as half a million attempted exploites are performed each and
every single day. In this talk, we will take a look at SQL Injection with
PHP and MySQL, and how to successfully prevent it. We'll look at and
demonstrate some known attack vectors. I will also demonstrate a brand new
attack vector that's never been seen before, and show how to mitigate it. We
will look at the tools that are available to mitigate attacks, and if the
tools actually work or not. We'll also take a look at what can be done by
both PHP and MySQL to help combat injections from the core.

Anthony Ferrara is a professional PHP developer and Systems Engineer, Zend
Certified Engineer and OWASP member. He is a contributor to multiple Open
Source projects as well as the community as a whole. He is also a former
Core Team Member and Development Coordinator for the Joomla! project, as
well as a former leader of its Security team. You can follow his blog at
blog.ircmaxell.com or on Twitter at @ircmaxell.

We have reserved a private backroom at a restaurant, with an LCD, free
wireless, and seating for about 40 people.

web development.  This month we're pleased to have pinch-hitters Adobe and
Zend on deck for game two of our June double header.

With classic web development benched, stay in the game with these tech
heavy-hitters as they give us an exclusive in-depth look at their new mobile
starting lineup, Flash Builder for PHP.  Join us this June when sluggers
Ryan Stewart and Edward Kietlinski step up to the plate and take us through
PHP mobile development, from A to Z.

Then come out for extra innings after the presentation for <b>FREE food and
drink</b> at TGI Fridays, thanks to Adobe and Zend.

As mobile is becoming more and more prominent client platform, developers
are interested in building similar rich desktop apps on mobile, by using
Flash and PHP you can build once and deploy on any major phone device
natively. Zend Server together with Flash Builder 4.5 for PHP adds complete
support for developing, testing and deploying mobile applications built
using Adobe Flex and PHP. Using your existing skills and familiar workflows,
you can now productively build and debug web, desktop and mobile
applications with Flash Builder. Attend this presentation to learn more
details including:

 - Single UI Framework - joint Flash/PHP project creation (Adobe and Zend)
 - Integrated Flex/PHP Debugging (Adobe and Zend)
 - Accelerated coding for Flex and Action Script projects (Adobe)
 - Build and deploy mobile apps for iOS, Android, and the PlayBook (Adobe)

Ryan Stewart (Adobe) holds an economics degree from the University of
Pennsylvania and is now a Rich Internet Application developer and industry
analyst. After graduating from Penn, he spent two years developing
applications for the Wharton School and pushing the idea of the web as a
platform for learning. Ryan now lives in Seattle with his wife and works at
Adobe as a Rich Internet Application Evangelist.

Edward Kietlinski (Zend) I'm currently at Zend Technologies for 5yrs and
have the honor and privilege to work with some of the industries tech
leaders at GE, ADP, NYSE, Cisco, here. I've been working on advanced
Internet projects since the early days at Netscape and then Opsware before
joining Zend. When I'm not working in my office, you can usually find me
working on my historic home in NJ.  Majored in CIS and minored in
IE=analytical approach to Business call Industrial Engineering. I always had
a passion for how entrepreneurs have inspired and spawned business by the
use of technology.

Security Series

New York PHP Community, in collaboration with OWASP, is holding a monthly
series that reviews each of the OWASP Top Ten Web Security threats.

In the final inning of a shutout June, we welcome back Anthony Ferrara to
share his insight and expertise on the ubiquitous vulnerability that is
cross site scripting (XSS).

You may also tune-in at 6:30pm:
  -- http://www.ustream.tv/channel/new-york-php

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is currently listed as OWASP's #2 highest risk
vulnerability affecting web applications today, yet most people simply don't
understand why they need to be concerned, and even more don't know how to
properly protect themselves against these common threats.

In this talk we will go over the core concepts of XSS - what it is, how it's
exploited, and the severity of the problem. We will dissect a real-world web
application to demonstrate finding - and exploiting - vulnerabilities.
Finally, we will review how to both prevent and thwart the XSS risk in your
code.

Anthony Ferrara is a Senior Developer at NBC Universal, a Zend Certified
Engineer and a OWASP member. He is a contributor to multiple Open Source
projects as well as the community as a whole. He is also a former Core Team
Member and Development Coordinator for the Joomla! project, as well as a
former leader of its Security team. You can follow his blog at

With classic web development benched, stay in the game with these tech
heavy-hitters as they give us an exclusive in-depth look at their new mobile
starting lineup, Flash Builder for PHP.  Join us this June when sluggers
Ryan Stewart and Edward Kietlinski step up to the plate and take us through
PHP mobile development, from A to Z.

Then come out for extra innings after the presentation for FREE food and

As mobile is becoming more and more prominent client platform, developers
are interested in building similar rich desktop apps on mobile, by using
Flash and PHP you can build once and deploy on any major phone device
natively. Zend Server together with Flash Builder 4.5 for PHP adds complete
support for developing, testing and deploying mobile applications built
using Adobe Flex and PHP. Using your existing skills and familiar workflows,
you can now productively build and debug web, desktop and mobile
applications with Flash Builder. Attend this presentation to learn more
details including:

 - Single UI Framework - joint Flash/PHP project creation (Adobe and Zend)
 - Integrated Flex/PHP Debugging (Adobe and Zend)
 - Accelerated coding for Flex and Action Script projects (Adobe)
 - Build and deploy mobile apps for iOS, Android, and the PlayBook (Adobe)

Ryan Stewart (Adobe) holds an economics degree from the University of
Pennsylvania and is now a Rich Internet Application developer and industry
analyst. After graduating from Penn, he spent two years developing
applications for the Wharton School and pushing the idea of the web as a
platform for learning. Ryan now lives in Seattle with his wife and works at
Adobe as a Rich Internet Application Evangelist.

Edward Kietlinski (Zend) I'm currently at Zend Technologies for 5yrs and
have the honor and privilege to work with some of the industries tech
leaders at GE, ADP, NYSE, Cisco, here. I've been working on advanced
Internet projects since the early days at Netscape and then Opsware before
joining Zend. When I'm not working in my office, you can usually find me
working on my historic home in NJ.  Majored in CIS and minored in
IE=analytical approach to Business call Industrial Engineering. I always had

Security Series
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and PHP Security
OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks Monthly Series
----------------------------------------------------------

         Date: Thursday, June 30th, 2011 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: Suspenders Restaurant, 111 Broadway, New York, NY 
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/192 (all attendees MUST RSVP)

New York PHP Community, in collaboration with OWASP, is holding a monthly
series that reviews each of the OWASP Top Ten Web Security threats.

In the final inning of a shutout June, we welcome back Anthony Ferrara to
share his insight and expertise on the ubiquitous vulnerability that is
cross site scripting (XSS).

You may also tune-in at 6:30pm:
  -- http://www.ustream.tv/channel/new-york-php

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is currently listed as OWASP's #2 highest risk
vulnerability affecting web applications today, yet most people simply don't
understand why they need to be concerned, and even more don't know how to
properly protect themselves against these common threats.

In this talk we will go over the core concepts of XSS - what it is, how it's
exploited, and the severity of the problem. We will dissect a real-world web
application to demonstrate finding - and exploiting - vulnerabilities.
Finally, we will review how to both prevent and thwart the XSS risk in your
code.

Anthony Ferrara is a Senior Developer at NBC Universal, a Zend Certified
Engineer and a OWASP member. He is a contributor to multiple Open Source
projects as well as the community as a whole. He is also a former Core Team
Member and Development Coordinator for the Joomla! project, as well as a
former leader of its Security team. You can follow his blog at
blog.ircmaxell.com or on Twitter at @ircmaxell.

We have reserved a private backroom at a restaurant, with an LCD, free
wireless, and seating for about 40 people.
