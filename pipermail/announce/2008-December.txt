Subject: [nycphp-announce] Merry PHPmas - And a new SIG
Message-ID: <019401c96077$fd1004f0$f7300ed0$@com>

All,

As another year at NYPHP draws to a close, a new one, thankfully, is right
around the corner.  Great how that always works out...

Anyway, during this thoughtful time of year, Slashdot perhaps has found the
best article:

We're also pleased to announce a new SIG at NYPHP.  The Sahana Project
(http://www.sahana.lk/) develops disaster management software that's in use
by countries worldwide, and right here at home.

Of course the platform of choice is AMP and we're looking forward to
building a vibrant community in cooperation with academics, governments and
corporations.

Subscribe to this low volume list - as traffic gets heavy, we're planning on
spawning additional lists and web space for the community.

As a bookkeeping note, there is no meeting in December.  We're looking
forward to Mitch in January and a great line-up for the new year.

Happy Holidays to all, and to all - a good night-of-coding.
