October General Meeting:
Native XML Databases
------------------------

 When: Tuesday, October 23rd, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

Databases and XML are both vital components of today's Internet and web
applications. Often, however, they're thought of being on distant ends of
the technology spectrum. This October, New York PHP is pleased to have
recognized XML and Java author Elliotte Rusty Harold speak on what it means
when these two worlds start to talk - natively.

While much data and many applications fit very neatly into tables, even more
data doesn't. Books, encyclopedias, web pages, legal briefs, poetry, and
more is not practically normalizable. SQL will continue to rule supreme for
accounting, human resources, taxes, inventory management, banking, and other
traditional systems where it's done well for the last twenty years. However,
many other applications in fields like publishing have not even had a
database backend. It's not that they didn't need one. It's just that the
databases of the day couldn't handle their needs, so content was simply
stored in Word files in a file system. These applications are going to be
revolutionized by XQuery and XML.

If you're working in publishing, including web publishing, you owe it to
yourself to take a serious look at the available XML databases. This
high-level talk explains what XML databases are good for and when you might
choose one over a more traditional solution. You'll learn about the
different options in both open and closed source XML databases including
pure XML, hybrid relational-XML, and other models.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
