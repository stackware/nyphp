May Meeting
-----------

   When: May 25th, 2004 at 6:30pm
  Where: Digital Pulp
Details: <A HREF="../../../index.html">http://nyphp.org</A>


New York PHP kicks an exciting summer schedule off with two
presentations this May.

After the meeting, you're invited to join us for food, drinks and
wireless at Abbey Tavern - details below.

fPage
-----
Felix Zaslavskiy guides us through fPage, a small utility class that
remembers users click history on the server side. Developers can
bookmark any page and be able to redirect the user back to that page at
any time in the future. fPage uses PHP sessions to keep track of state
and provides a nice user interface to the developer.

HTML_QuickForm
--------------
Displaying and processing HTML forms correctly in PHP can be a headache.
You need to pay attention to printing context-sensitive error messages,
preserving default values, properly encoding user input, and validating
many different kinds of fields. The PEAR package HTML_QuickForm removes
that headache. It's flexible architecture makes it a breeze to
programmatically construct, display, and validate HTML forms of any
size.

In this talk, David Sklar shows you how to harness the power of
HTML_QuickForm in your PHP programs. He explains:

  -- Working with different element types
  -- Validating input with built-in and custom rules
  -- Processing submitted form data, including file uploads
  -- Customizing form display with the default renderer

With HTML_QuickForm, a form is a logical collection of typed form
elements instead of an undifferentiated blob of HTML. This makes it
simple to decide dynamically what elements go in a particular form, to
assign appropriate error messages and validation rules to individual
elements, and to control the form layout in a systematic way across an
entire site.

Instead of relying on ad-hoc functions and methods for tasks like
checking whether required form fields are filled in, preserving a
default value in a dropdown menu, or adjusting the style attributes of
form elements, use HTML_QuickForm for a simple, structured approach to
form management.

Join Felix and David for an in-depth look at fPage and HTML_QuickForm.

SAMS Publishing, our latest sponsor, has been kind enough to provide us
with books to raffle off.  Come prepared with a business card to enter
the drawing.


        When: Tuesday, May 25th, at 6:30pm (4th Tuesday of every month)
       Where: Digital Pulp, Inc.  220 East 23rd Street, Suite 900 (9th
floor)
Post-Meeting: Abbey Tavern 354 3rd Avenue, Private Room in the Back

As always this meeting is free and open to the public - please be sure
to RSVP by sending a message to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">rsvp at nyphp.org.</A>  And after the meeting
join the NYPHP crew for good food and wireless!


April's &quot;New York PHP and Clew&quot; Presentation Online
---------------------------------------------------

After April's presentation about the new New York PHP and our top
project, Clew, interest has been fantastic.  It's clear people want to
get involved, and we're working hard to make it as easy as possible.

If you missed the &quot;New York PHP and Clew&quot; presentation, it's now online
with audio at:
