As mobile is becoming more and more prominent client platform, developers
are interested in building similar rich desktop apps on mobile, by using
Flash and PHP you can build once and deploy on any major phone device
natively. Zend Server together with Flash Builder 4.5 for PHP adds complete
support for developing, testing and deploying mobile applications built
using Adobe Flex and PHP. Using your existing skills and familiar workflows,
you can now productively build and debug web, desktop and mobile
applications with Flash Builder. Attend this presentation to learn more
details including:

 - Single UI Framework - joint Flash/PHP project creation (Adobe and Zend)
 - Integrated Flex/PHP Debugging (Adobe and Zend)
 - Accelerated coding for Flex and Action Script projects (Adobe)
 - Build and deploy mobile apps for iOS, Android, and the PlayBook (Adobe)

Ryan Stewart (Adobe) holds an economics degree from the University of
Pennsylvania and is now a Rich Internet Application developer and industry
analyst. After graduating from Penn, he spent two years developing
applications for the Wharton School and pushing the idea of the web as a
platform for learning. Ryan now lives in Seattle with his wife and works at
Adobe as a Rich Internet Application Evangelist.

Edward Kietlinski (Zend) I'm currently at Zend Technologies for 5yrs and
have the honor and privilege to work with some of the industries tech
leaders at GE, ADP, NYSE, Cisco, here. I've been working on advanced
Internet projects since the early days at Netscape and then Opsware before
joining Zend. When I'm not working in my office, you can usually find me
working on my historic home in NJ.  Majored in CIS and minored in
IE=analytical approach to Business call Industrial Engineering. I always had
a passion for how entrepreneurs have inspired and spawned business by the
