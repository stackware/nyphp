New York PHP Community, in collaboration with OWASP, is holding a monthly
series that reviews each of the OWASP Top Ten Web Security threats.

In the final inning of a shutout June, we welcome back Anthony Ferrara to
share his insight and expertise on the ubiquitous vulnerability that is
cross site scripting (XSS).

You may also tune-in at 6:30pm:

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is currently listed as OWASP's #2 highest risk
vulnerability affecting web applications today, yet most people simply don't
understand why they need to be concerned, and even more don't know how to
properly protect themselves against these common threats.

In this talk we will go over the core concepts of XSS - what it is, how it's
exploited, and the severity of the problem. We will dissect a real-world web
application to demonstrate finding - and exploiting - vulnerabilities.
Finally, we will review how to both prevent and thwart the XSS risk in your
code.

Anthony Ferrara is a Senior Developer at NBC Universal, a Zend Certified
Engineer and a OWASP member. He is a contributor to multiple Open Source
projects as well as the community as a whole. He is also a former Core Team
Member and Development Coordinator for the Joomla! project, as well as a
former leader of its Security team. You can follow his blog at
blog.ircmaxell.com or on Twitter at @ircmaxell.

We have reserved a private backroom at a restaurant, with an LCD, free
wireless, and seating for about 40 people.
