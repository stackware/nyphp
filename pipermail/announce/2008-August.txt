Hello all,

Just to remind everyone there will be no meeting this coming Tuesday, August
26th, but we have a very full and exciting Fall lineup.  Keep an eye on
http://www.nyphp.org for the latest and RSVP for the September meeting after
Tuesday.

Have a great remaining Summer, Labor Day, and we'll see you in the Fall.
