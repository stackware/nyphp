Hello,

Thanks to the help and participation of many community members over the
years, we've collected a great set of photos from various events and
meetings.  Shout outs to Brian and Fernando for getting the flickr group
together and importing old images.

We'd especially like to thank Mike DeWitt for snapping some of the greatest
photos - and adding some of the funniest remarks - along the way.

And now you can see them all, in full Web 2.0 splendor, at NYPHP's very own
flickr group:

http://www.flickr.com/groups/nyphp/

So feel free to browse through yesteryear - and most importantly - snap
pictures at future events and throw them into the Group's Pool.

Sure flickr is confusing, but hey, it's for the PHP!

February General Meeting:
Yasca Static Code Analysis and the Zend Framework Circa 2009
------------------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, February 24th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

Thanks to Hallmark Holiday Valentines Day, February is all about love. First
up, we all love good solid code.  So we're pleased to have Michael Scovetta
talk on Yasca and static source code analysis.  Next, PHP developers love
their frameworks and this month NYPHP is pleased to have expert and ZCE Alan
Seiden talk tech about peace, love, and the Zend Framework.


Yasca - An Open Framework for Automated Source Code Analysis

Over the past few years, commercial static analysis tools have matured
considerably, now generally providing high-quality results along with
features that large enterprises require. On the open-source front, tools
including PMD and FindBugs offer good results against Java and C/C++ code,
but few other high-quality tools exist. Yasca was created to aggregate the
results of other open-source tools and to provide a framework for quickly
adding new patterns to scan.  It focuses issues related to security,
performance, and bad practices within C/C++, Java, PHP, HTML/CSS,
JavaScript, COBOL, and other languages.

Michael Scovetta recently joined CA as a Principal IT Security Engineer,
prior to which he worked for Cigital as a senior consultant and UBS
Financial Services as an Information Security Analyst. He has various roles
at these organizations including that of a developer, architect, security
evangelist, penetration tester, security architect. Michael holds a CISSP
certification, a M.Eng. in Computer Science from Cornell University and a
B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Hofstra University. His
personal site is http://www.scovettalabs.com and he is on LinkedIn.


Zend Framework Circa 2009

The Zend Framework is known for its flexibility, corporate-friendly
licensing, and compatibility with diverse platforms and database systems.

This technical presentation by Alan Seiden, a Zend Certified Engineer for
Zend Framework, offers guidance for prospective and current users.
Developers planning a project will discover what ZF can offer. More
experienced users will learn about ZF's recent time saving enhancements.

A leader in developing PHP-based web applications on IBM i (System i, i5,
iSeries, AS/400), Alan has written many articles on the subject. He served
as a consultant for the IBM manual Zend Core for i5/OS. He is senior
developer and technical lead at Strategic Business Systems in northern New
Jersey. Alan's blog: http://www.alanseiden.com/

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles.

 When: Tuesday, February 24th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend - that means RSVP
