<PRE>As many know, NYPHP also runs a PHP meetup as the informal compliment to our
monthly meetings.

And we've got a very special meeting coming up - read all about it:

<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/new-york-php/">http://www.meetup.com/new-york-php/</A>

Join for location details. These events are always free, and in May,
complimentary food and drink will be provided.

Our May meet-up is May 14th so that we can welcome special guest Sigurd
Magnusson of the SilverStripe CMS (<A HREF="http://www.silverstripe.com">http://www.silverstripe.com</A>) from New
Zealand.

SilverStripe is hitting the USA East coast in May, with co-founder Sigurd
Magnusson keen to meet developers and organizations interested in our
software and business. You will get to learn the story behind SilverStripe,
influence our upcoming decisions, ask pointed questions, and get a preview
of new features!

And FREE beer and d'oeuvres will be served - thank you to SilverStripe for
sponsoring this meetup!

Sigurd will take about 30 minutes to review the CMS and then do Q&amp;A with the
group. Then, time permitting, we'll move onto our Beer Review segment, with
5-10 minute topics from our community. Here's the breakdown:

6:15pm - 6:30pm - Networking and topic submission
6:30pm - 7:00pm - Silverstripe CMS
7:00pm - 7:30pm - Beer Review topic discussion

We have reserved a private backroom at a restaurant, with an LCD, free
wireless, and seating for about 40 people.

Presentation topics:
-- general questions/answers about PHP or anything AMP
-- review/analysis of a problem or existing solution

Come prepared with your presentation topic!

Please arrive by 6:30pm and if you have a topic you'd like to discuss,
arrive prior to 6:30pm.

See you there!
