Building Enterprise Applications with Mozilla, AMP, XML-RPC and JSON 
 
As a follow-up to his introductory presentation last year on connecting
Mozilla applications to a LAMP (or WAMP) backend using XML-RPC, Jay Sheth
will explain how to build large data-set applications on the same
combination of platforms.
 
A convincing desktop/web-application hybrid can be built using XUL,
JavaScript, PHP and MySQL by letting each component in this platform do what
it does best. XUL has a rich set of user interface widgets (editable combox
boxes, tabs, and so on) not found in HTML; thus XUL activated with
JavaScript enables easy data entry and modification. PHP is great at getting
data from external resources (local MySQL database, remote web service
gateways), processing it, and sending it back to the browser.
MySQL is great at storing, sorting and searching through data.
 
Jay will show how one can building a useful and usable rich web application
by focusing on and combining each component's strength.
 
But sometimes, even using each component's strength results in a solution
that is not as fast as desired. If the application is retrieving over 500
records at once, the main bottleneck is often the underlying transport
protocol. XML-RPC can facilitate communication between Mozilla and the AMP
backend, but also also proves to be resource intesive to parse on the
client-side. This is due to the verbose structure of its underlying XML
format. In order to speed up the retrieval of large chunks of data, the JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) format can be used instead.
 
With the help of source code examples and a real world application, Jay will
explain how to best use each part of the Mozilla + AMP platform, and how to
alternate between the XML-RPC and JSON data transports in order to create a
responsive, rich and useful web application.
 
Thanks to Dan Krook and Platinum sponsor IBM for providing a great
presentation space with seating for plenty.
 
As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.
 
Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.
