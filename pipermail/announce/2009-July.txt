Flexing PHP with Flex Builder 4

Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)

The dog days of summer may finally be here, but that isn't an excuse for
dogging out on our continuing series on RIAs. This July we welcome back
Kevin Hoyt from Adobe for a look at how you can flex your stuff with the new
features in Adobe Flex Builder 4 and PHP.

Kevin will be showing off the new features in Adobe Flex Builder 4 for PHP
developers, and how Flex can integrate easily with the Zend framework for
building rich Internet applications quickly.

And join us at TGI Friday's at 56th and Lexington after the meeting for
complimentary food and drink, thanks to Adobe.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles.
