We're pleased to have John Coggeshall (and spring) return to NYPHP for our
April meeting. Long-time web expert, John will show his latest techniques
for rolling out and managing web applications.

You may also tune-in Tuesday at 6:30pm:
  -- http://www.ustream.tv/channel/new-york-php

One of the most undiscussed subjects in web application development today is
application deployment. In this talk, we'll discuss how to use a great
deployment tool Puppet to not only deploy your application into staging or
production, but how that exact same work can be used to build robust
development environments quickly and easily that are entirely consistent
with their staging and production counterparts. In this talk you'll learn
actionable techniques, tips and tricks to take your deployments and
development environments from self-created hacks to robust maintainable
processes.

John Coggeshall is CTO of Individual Digital, Inc., an advertising market
platform designed to connect consumers and advertisers directly together. A
former senior member of Zend Technologies' Global Services team, he got
started with PHP in 1997 and is the author of four published books and over
100 articles on PHP technologies with some of the biggest names in the
industry such as Sams Publishing, Apress and O'Reilly. John also is a active
contributor to the PHP core as the author of the tidy extension, a member of
the Zend Education Advisory Board, and frequent speaker at PHP-related
conferences worldwide. His web site, www.coggeshall.org/ is an excellent
resource for any PHP developer and you can follow him on twitter by adding

an MVC framework written in PHP 5. Co-founder Sigurd Magnusson is visiting
from New Zealand and will give a preview of material to be presented at the
upcoming Chicago CMS Expo Learning and Business Conference (cmsexpo.net)

We have reserved a private backroom at a restaurant, with an LCD, free
wireless, and seating for about 40 people.

Presentation agenda:
  - Overview of SilverStripe CMS and Sapphire framework.
  - Roadmap for 2011: SilverStripe CMS v3.0, and Sapphire as a stand-alone
MVC framework.
  - Software usability and interaction design in an open source model.
  - Q&A.
