January General Meeting:
The Future of CakePHP - PHP 5.3, Frameworks and the CMS
-------------------------------------------------------

         Date: January 26th, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/147 (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

Wow - it's 2010. The future is here and appropriately we'll look to CakePHP
lead cosmonaut Nate Abele to take us on an odyssey of both Cake and PHP.
Join us this January as we mark NYPHP's ninth year and sit back while the
monolith evolves your understanding of HAL CakePHP and the future of PHP
frameworks - and we'll see you in 3001.

Now that the major PHP frameworks have reached sustained maturity, where do
we go from here? With the long-awaited release of PHP 5.3, many are gearing
up to take advantage of the available features with new major versions,
which will change the way we create web applications. We'll take a sneak
peak at the next major version of CakePHP to see what this evolution might
look like, and how you can apply new techniques in your own projects.

Nate Abele is the lead developer of the CakePHP framework, an
internationally ignored author and speaker, and has come to be known as the
Johnny Cash of the PHP community. Having lived in the midwestern US and both
coasts, Nate has currently taken up residence in the most desolate place on
the planet: New Jersey. When not code-monkey'ing or yelling at people for
"doin' it rong", Nate enjoys snowboarding, playing guitar, being a beach
bum, and writing about himself in the third person.
