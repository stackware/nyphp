Source Code Analysis for PHP
Introducing a revolutionary new ideology for securing Web-applications.
Armorize CodeSecure!

Armorize Technologies has developed a new process for verifying the security
of Web-application source code. The premier product, CodeSecure, developed
specifically for PHP, represents a powerful tool for identifying and fixing
vulnerabilities in custom developed PHP applications. The simple,
easy-to-use Web-interface tool promises to cut down the hassles of ensuring
application security by allowing developers to integrate code verification
directly into the earliest stage of the Software Development LifeCycle.

Join Armorize CEO, Wayne, COO, Matt, Chief Architect, Chris, and other
security veterans in the Armorize team for an in-depth discussion of this
cutting-edge technology and the promise it holds for the future of
Web-application security.

>From an in-depth explanation of how it works, to an illustration of how you
can use it, to an overview of how we plan to deliver it and a live
demonstration of the technology itself. This presentation promises to change
the way you think about PHP security, and consequently change your
perspective on the limits of PHP, opening many new doors and illuminating
many new paths into the future.

November General Meeting:
NYPHP-Talk Live
-------------------------

 When: Tuesday, November 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

Still sleepy from the tryptophan, New York PHP Community again presents
NYPHP-Talk Live for our post-Thanksgiving November General Meeting.

NYPHP-Talk Live, which we first did for our August meeting, is an open
forum, giving the community a chance to ask questions, voice their opinions,
and interact in person. The NYPHP Talk Mailing List is regarded as one of
the premier technical and non-technical discussion lists for the PHP and
open source communities. NYPHP-Talk Live brings the list to life by opening
the meeting floor to those with engaging questions and insightful
viewpoints.

The format of this meeting is very different from the usual. Rather than a
single presentation, we're asking community members to come and speak for no
more than 5 minutes. These short "lighting talks" will be the basis to spark
further audience participation, discussion and Q&A.

No slides or formal presentation material is required, but a projector will
be available, and we encourage everyone to come and start impromptu
discussion. Discussions will be moderated, and capped at 30 minutes, at
which point another lighting talk will be presented. Here are some tips:


    * Viewpoint and experience based questions and discussions are best

    * Feel free to come prepared with a couple of URLs or other online
material to help demonstrate your discussion points

    * Basic how-to questions will have a lower priority


NYPHP-Talk Live isn't an easy way to get technical help - don't come with a
list of homework questions. Think of broader, more engaging question and
discussion points. While technical discussion is encouraged, be mindful of
material that is more appropriate for in-person discussion, rather than the
mailing list.

No prior registration is required (except to RSVP), and we encourage
everyone to come with their questions and discussion starters. Laptops and
Internet access will be available to aid in discussion and for short
demonstrations.

With a successful NYPHP-Talk Live alpha release over the summer, join us
again for our second release this November.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings are always
free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, November 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

Subject: [nycphp-announce] holiday@nyphp: Holiday Party 2006
Message-ID: <011001c706b3$565b5fd0$6c0aa8c0@MobileZ>


This year, NYCBUG and NYPHP are once again in cahoots for a holiday party -
with a twist. We'll have two 10 minute hard-nosed presentations to kick
things of and set the mood.

First, NYCBUG's Alfred Perlstein will speak on "Captchas can be LOL."

Then, NYPHP's Hans Zaunere will speak on "Unfashionable FreeBSD: Why Their
Threads Are So Last Year."

Then stick around for cash bar and food into the evening.

So join us:

    * Suspenders Restaurant (http://www.suspendersbar.com/directions.html)
    * Thursday, December 7th, 2006
    * 6:00pm - 9:00pm

Please RSVP to rsvp AT nycbug DOT org if you plan to attend.
