	Web Services

Special Presentation:
Mobile Data: How to Avoid the Latency Trap When Using Web Services
------------------------------------------------------------------

Full details at http://www.nyphp.org/

As a pre-cursor to the Yahoo! Open Hack Day, we're pleased to have a special
presentation from YDN Senior Developer, Tom Hughes-Croucher.

NOTE: RSVP is not required but please arrive early to reserve a seat.

Why is mobile different to desktop? When it comes to data there are lots of
difference such as processing and most importantly data transmission. Our
goal as developers should always be to make the fastest apps possible,
however mobile adds a lot of constraints to the platforms we are used to
developing for on the desktop. This talk will focus how you can avoid the
problems that network latency creates by being smart with your server
implementation.

Tom Hughes-Croucher is an Evangelist and Senior Developer in Yahoo's Open
Strategy Group, focusing on Yahoos Web Services and Cloud Platform. Tom has
contributed to a number of Web standards for the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) and the British Standards Institute (BSI). Previously he helped build
the online music stores for some of the UK's largest brands including Tesco,
Three Telecom and Channel 4.

forward to the biggest and best Bootup yet.

Please submit your pitches ASAP to lock in a slot.  The site contains
details for how to submit.

And for developers, simply RSVP and we'll see you there.

October General Meeting:
Saving Mongos with MongoDB and PHP
----------------------------------

         Date: October 27th, 2009 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP  (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

We love Fall - especially since Summer is such a dud - because it's all
about transition and this month we're looking at how web-supporting database
systems are transitioning. We welcome Kristina Chodorow of MongoDB, and
MongoDB PHP extension author, to review these new database trends, and give
us her two mongos as to whether the hot days of the RDBMS are being replaced
by the brisk days of the document database management system (DDBMS
anyone?).

In the last couple of years, dozens of non-relational databases have
appeared to solve problems that relational databases aren't good at.
Kristina will briefly cover the different types databases available and what
their benefits, drawbacks, and features are. Most of the talk will focus on
creating fast, scalable PHP applications by using MongoDB, an easy-to-learn
document-oriented database. She will use the MongoDB PHP driver to
demonstrate how to write a Twitter-like application that scales with users,
friending, and messaging. She will also demonstrate how to use the database
as a file store by creating a Flickr-like application.

Kristina Chodorow is a software engineer at MongoDB. She wrote and maintains
the MongoDB PHP driver.
