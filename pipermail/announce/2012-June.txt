Just when you thought that school's out for summer, there's one more
lesson to be learned - and you won't want to skip this class. NYPHP
pillar and IBMer Daniel Krook will school us on what IBM and Zend are
doing with PHP in the cloud, including an exclusive inside look at
DB2-as-a-service and the Zend PHP PAAS. Don't be held back; grab your
dads and grads and join Mr. Krook this June for one more day of
pencils, books and developer's dirty looks.

Zend and IBM recently announced solutions for running the Zend
Application Fabric (powered by Zend Server) on IBM PureSystems for
on-premise cloud deployment, and on IBM SmartCloud Enterprise for
public cloud deployment. Daniel Krook from IBM will describe how to
deploy a Zend PHP cluster on the IBM cloud, integrated with the IBM
elastic load balancer and the DB2 Database-as-a-Service.

You will learn how to activate the Zend Application Fabric pattern,
model your desired topology and set a scaling policy, monitor the
running application infrastructure, dive into Zend platform
configuration, view IBM elasticity and fault tolerance in action, and
perform repeatable and reliable deployments using a topology template
via the REST API.

Daniel Krook is an IBM/Open Group Master Certified IT Specialist based
in the greater New York City area. He has over twelve years experience
in web application development and currently builds a Cloud
infrastructure for IBM using Java EE, DB2, REST, and mobile
technologies. He holds certifications in cloud architecture, PHP, Java
EE, BlackBerry, DB2, and Solaris. He writes PHP-related articles for
IBM developerWorks and co-authored the IBM Redbook 'Developing PHP
Applications for IBM Data Servers.' Daniel is active in the local
technical community and has hosted monthly New York PHP user group
meetings since 2004. You can follow him on Twitter via @danielkrook
