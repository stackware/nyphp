October General Meeting:
Lighten RIA with Adobe AIR, Flex & AMF
--------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, NOVEMBER 4th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

Scared of complex RIA applications and the brain eating zombie army of
acronyms like Ajax, AIR, Flex and AMF? For our October meeting, NYPHP and
Adobe stand together to cover all the ghoulish details of RIA, so you don't
lose your head this Halloween.

NOTE: This meeting is on NOVEMBER 4th.

AND stick around after the presentation for complimentary drinks and hors
d'oeuvres at TGI Fridays, thanks to Adobe.

Rich Internet applications (RIAs) are everywhere. With Web businesses like
Google and Yahoo! and brick and mortar companies like Harley Davidson and
Sherwin Williams embracing RIAs for their online presence, the media buzz is
giving way to the reality of a better Internet.

Adobe has recently contributed AMF support to the Zend Framework, allowing
PHP developers to easily build Rich Internet Applications using Flex and
Adobe AIR that interact with a PHP backend.

Kevin Hoyt, a technical evangelist with Adobe, will give an introduction to
Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR, and will walk through how to create a Flex
application powered by PHP and the Zend Framework. Working with Zend Studio
for Eclipse, and Flex Builder (an Eclipse plugin), Kevin will demonstrate
how to build, debug and deploy applications built with Adobe Flex, and how
to have these same applications run on the desktop using the Adobe AIR
runtime.

With this knowledge, developers will be able to easily build rich Internet
applications that combine data from PHP and rich media like audio and video
into a compelling application.

About Kevin:
I'm a Platform Evangelist with Adobe Systems, Inc. and I like lines.
Specifically, I like moving them, breaking them, blurring them and jumping
over them. If the lines form a box, that's even better because then I get to
think outside of them. Pushing the envelope of what technology can do, and
how people perceive and interact with it, is the name of my game.

I am a frequent traveler who enjoys meeting with developers, programmers,
architects, managers and anybody else involved with technology. Most of the
time you'll find me somewhere in the United States speaking at conferences,
user groups, or anywhere else they'll give me time in front of an audience.
The rest of the time I enjoy spending with my family at home in Parker, CO.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles from
Adobe.

 When: Tuesday, NOVEMBER 4th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)

Subject: [nycphp-announce] special@nyphp: Writing a Social Application with
	PHP/MySQL
Message-ID: <02ce01c9411b$28ffb960$7aff2c20$@com>

We're stuffing November with another great presentation. This time we're
pleased to host Sun/MySQL with Duleepa Wijayawardhana and Giuseppe Maxia on
two of the hottest topics - as in pumpkin pie - social applications and
performance.

Join this special event at the Suspenders Bar and Restaurant for a great
talk from the technical leaders at Sun/MySQL.

 NOTE: This meeting is NOT at IBM and on 11/12/08. RSVP is not required, but
arrive early
       as space is limited.

 When: Wednesday, November 12th at 6:30pm sharp

Where: Suspenders Bar and Restaurant (www.suspendersnyc.com)
       111 Broadway at Thames Street, back meeting room


-- Writing a Social Application with PHP/MySQL
   And what happens when a million people show up on opening day

Imagine you've decided to create a social application for the web. Imagine
that contrary to popular belief amongst all your peers, you've managed to
find the secret missing ingredient to social networking and a million people
show up, 990,000 more than you thought would actually bother. We'll discuss
real life scenarios where that actually happened to me and all the lessons
learned "on the job".

Some of what we will go into:

- Creating Social Applications with PHP/MySQL and how it's changed over the
years.

- The difference between High Performance and High Availability in an
application and database.

- Identifying the pain points in an application.

- Using MySQL features to scale an application.

- Building the ability into your application and database to scale including
the use of memcached.

- Some details and/or introduction to using XDebug, Explain and monitoring.

Consider this a fun interactive talk filled with many horror stories of the
amazing things that go wrong in real life when you've thought you've planned
well.

This talk can cover as much technical detail as needed!

Duleepa Wijayawardhana (Dups) is MySQL's newly minted North American
Community Relations Manager and was plucked from the clutches of MySQL Web
Team where he has worked for the last 1.5 years. The Web Team manages the
external web sites of MySQL which draw a considerable amount of web traffic.

Before joining MySQL, Dups worked for game developer BioWare Corp. in
Edmonton, Canada where he helped develop and run the extremely popular
BioWare Community Site (Neverwinter Nights Community), BioWare Store, and
various other web properties as well as Manager for BioWare's Application
Support Team.

 NOTE: This meeting is NOT at IBM and on 11/12/08. RSVP is not required.

 When: Wednesday, November 12th at 6:30pm sharp

Where: Suspenders Bar and Restaurant (www.suspendersnyc.com)

November General Meeting:
Coding Secure with PHP and Enterprise LAMP Security

 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

What would another November meeting be without cliche turkey jokes? Security
isn't just gravy for web developers, but trying to understand all the latest
buzzwords will make you feel like you're running around without a head. This
month, New York PHP Managing Member Hans Zaunere provides a cornucopia of
best practices and simple security fundamentals that will prevent you from
being the turkey. Given originally at OWASP's AppSec Conference, join NYPHP
and get the buckshot you need to knock the stuffing out of that wiley script
kiddie.

Anyone involved in web application development over the last five years
should be aware of the security ecosystem surrounding PHP. Often overhyped,
sometimes dramatic, and always interesting, the topics of PHP and security
are usually linked at the hip, and a favorite comedy topic for those
involved with other languages.

While PHP has made some security mistakes in the past, the focus of
criticism is often misguided. The applicable codebase for the security
notices - whether it be the PHP core, an extension, or an application - is
forgotten and PHP as a whole gets one more strike.

PHP also provides great power and flexibility. But with it, comes great
responsibility. As with any application living on the internet, it's the
entire support staff's responsibility architect, developer, and
administrator - to ensure an application meets organization security
requirements.

In this talk, Hans Zaunere, Managing Member, New York PHP, provides tips,
tricks, and fundamental best practices from the trenches for ensuring your
code and LAMP deployment isn't caught off guard. He'll then review the PHP
security ecosystem and available resources, debunk myths, and reveal some
surprising facts that could leave you thinking PHP is one of the most secure
languages available today.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
