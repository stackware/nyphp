May General Meeting:
Introduction to Databases for Programmers
-----------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, May 22nd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

This May, New York PHP takes a look at a critical, yet often overlooked,
aspect of web development. The database is the heart of any system, but it
often gets-no-respect by application developers. Join Kenneth Downs as he
leads us through the important database concepts for a successful system.

Databases work on principles that are different from programs. Best
programming practices, when applied to databases, will produce bad results,
and vice versa. In this talk we will look at how databases differ from code
(the so-called "impedance mismatch" between code and data), see a brief
introduction to normalization, find out what "ACID compliant" means, and see
some triggers and stored procedures.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

Building Data Centric Web Applications with Little Code

to have a rich client interface for your applications? PHPOpenBiz (OpenBiz)
is the solution! PHPOpenBiz is a PHP-based business application framework

    * Metadata-driven design principal. Developers declare business logic
      as metadata (zero-coding)

    * Model-View-Controller

    * Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

    * AJAX browser client

    * Eclipse integrated authoring tool


The goal of PHPOpenBiz is to speed up development of business applications
by providing standard development structures that allow producing database
driven web interfaces in less or no time. PHPOpenBiz can minimize
application supportability & maximize application upgradeability by:
providing centralized & complete application framework, minimizing
application coding requirements and clear separation of technology from
business. PHPOpenbiz is the first application framework that brings
metadata-driven concept from successful commercial products to the open
source world.

Rocky Swen has been playing as an architect role for PHPOpenbiz for more
than 3 years. He is not only making big contribution of the design and
coding of the framework, but also helping PHPOpenbiz community to learn and
develop their own PHPOpenbiz basd applications.
