Subject: [nycphp-announce] next@nyphp: No Meeting Tonight;
	Networking Party in August
Message-ID: <022101c7ce0a$9ffcfb20$651ba8c0@MobileZ>


Hello,

Please note that there is no meeting at IBM tonight.  The next meeting we
have scheduled will be Sept.

In August, we'll be holding a networking party with NYCBUG and others at The
Delancey, in the LES.  We're looking at either August 16th or August 23rd.

We're also looking forward to scheduling our fall meeting lineup.  If you
have ideas for a topic, or would like to speak yourself, please feel free to
submit or suggest a presentation.

We can host either online presentations, or in-person meetings at IBM.

Around the end of August, we will also begin organizing the NYPHP.org
community project.  Stay tuned for details.

Thanks all, and have a great summer.
