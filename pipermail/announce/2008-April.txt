Subject: [nycphp-announce] special@nyphp: Drupal vs. Joomla! A Talk by Forest
	Mars
Message-ID: <070a01c89a84$9d57b2b0$d8071810$@com>

"Drupal vs. Joomla: Who rules, who drools?" is a talk to be given by Forest
Mars to the Joomla! SIG of New York PHP, on Thursday April 10th, 2008 at the
Robert Half Technology Center. Attendance is open to all, RSVP is required
for building access.

To RSVP send your name to <ircmaxell at yahoo.com>. Robert Half location
information follows below.

The full announcement may be found at http://www.joomlanyc.org/

In a talk that's sure to be simultaneously light-hearted and heavy-hitting,
Forest Mars breaks down the differences (and some similarities) between the
Joomla! and Drupal content management systems, neither of which, it should
be noted, are even in the top 10 of CMSes (according to a secret study not
released by Google.) The talk is aimed primarily at Joomla! developers who
want to see how the other half lives, which is somewhat logical since
migration from Drupal to Joomla is a bit like driving the wrong way during a
Grand Prix.

Forest Mars is a Web Developer and Network Architect best known for starting
New York's Only Free Internet Cafe and the first Wireless ISP in Manhattan.
He is currently working on a Video-on-Demand system for smart phones, but
then who isn't? Contact him directly via forest-at-bway-dot-net.

This meeting will be held at Robert Half Technology, 245 Park Ave (1 block
N. of Grand Central Station)

Full Meeting Schedule: 

6:00 - 6:30 : General meet and greet, no formal structure.

6:30 - 7:00 : Question and Answer sessions.

7:00 - 8:00 : Joomla vs. Drupal, by Forrest Mars.

8:00 - 8:30 : More Q&A / Site Showcase

8:30 - Whenever - TGI Fridays (47 East 42nd St).

Message-ID: <010901c89bdb$10e90970$32bb1c50$@com>

April General Meeting:
Web 2.0 Mashups from IBM
------------------------

 NOTE: This meeting occurs on MONDAY, April 21st.

 When: MONDAY, April 21st, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

New York PHP is honored to have open source great Wietse Venema speak about
his recent work on PHP tainted variable support, a critical piece of
security.

 NOTE: This meeting occurs on MONDAY, April 21st.

PHP is a popular server scripting language for creating dynamic web page
content. While writing applications can be relatively easy, avoiding
security holes can be difficult. In an attempt to help improve PHP
application security, Wietse proposed to add run-time support for tainted
variables in December 2006, and released a first implementation in November
2007. With a run-time overhead of only 1-2%, permanent deployment becomes a
realistic option. Wietse will show how his taint support works, and how it
can help programmers to eliminate vulnerabilities such as Cross-site
scripting, SQL injection, Shell command injection, Remote file inclusion,
and more.

Wietse Venema is known for his software such as the TCP Wrapper and the
POSTFIX mail system. He co-authored the SATAN network scanner and the
Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) for forensic analysis, as well as a book on Forensic
Discovery. Wietse received awards from the System Administrator's Guild
(SAGE), the Netherlands UNIX User Group (NLUUG), as well as a Sendmail
innovation award. He served a two-year term as chair of the international
Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). Wietse currently is a
research staff member at the IBM T. J. Watson research center. After
completing his Ph.D. in physics he changed career to computer science and
never looked back.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 NOTE: This meeting occurs on MONDAY, April 21st.

 When: MONDAY, April 21st, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)

Message-ID: <00f301c8a562$e2980210$a7c80630$@com>

Hi all,

I'd like to let everyone know about our PHP Meetup organization efforts.

On the 1st Tuesday of every month, at 6:30pm, we'll be getting together at
Pound and Pence for an informal gathering of PHP, web, and open source
folks.

Details are at http://php.meetup.com/430/

These meetups will be the informal networking events to compliment our
continued monthly general meetings at IBM.

The first meetup is May 6th.  The venue might start to get packed beyond 50
attendees, so please RSVP at the site above so we have a rough count.

We're also looking forward to continuing these events through the summer and
in conjunction with other area groups.

Looking forward to meeting up with everyone at this first event, through the
summer, and beyond.
