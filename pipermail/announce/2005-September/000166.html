<PRE>
The heat has finally broken and it's now time to get back to work. With that, we're pleased to have Chris Shiflett, prolific author for O'Reilly, phpArchitect and PHP Magazine, presenting on the too often neglected topic of PHP Security.

Peer reviews are a frequently neglected asset of professional PHP development teams. With a moderate understanding of how to audit PHP code, you can vastly improve the security of your team's PHP applications.  This talk, by Chris Shiflett, explains the art of the PHP security audit. Using practical examples, you are shown how to search for common pitfalls, how to identify filtering and escaping errors, and how to report your findings.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

When: Tuesday, September 27th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)

Where: IBM  590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)

RSVP: RSVP Online, <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>
