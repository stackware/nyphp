September General Meeting:
The Code of Open Source Licenses
 - Comparing the Art of Programming with Legalese
-------------------------------------------------

         Date: September 22nd, 2009 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP</A>  (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

Wow, what a great summer that was.  It's hard to believe that was called
&quot;summer&quot; and that we're in the *bers of 2009 already, and it's even harder
to believe how similar legal and contract writing is to programming.  But
let's face - you're either programming a computer system, or programming a
legal system.  This September, we're looking forward to a one-of-a-kind
talk, and pleased to have Charles B. Kramer, Esq. speak on the fundamentals
of licenses and intellectual property (IP) of the software world and how, in
fact, legalese is just another form of programming.

A software license is like source code -- it should contain consistent
definitions, processes that branch upon &quot;if/then&quot; conditions, and
predictable consequences when one or another event triggers termination.
Once you learn what the &quot;code&quot; of a well structured license looks like,
you'll be  able to distinguish between a license that is confusing because
it's difficult, and one that's confusing because it's just poorly drafted.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles and
jho
