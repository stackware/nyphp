on Yahoo! and beyond.

The 24-hour Hack Day kicks off Friday afternoon. The hack space is open all
night and experts will be on hand to answer questions. Bring yourself and
your ideas or find a team to work with when you get there. On Saturday
afternoon, hackers will demo their working code in the plush Hudson Theater
for a chance at glory and some cool prizes.

Top-notch technologies, plenty of food, and two full days to meet up with
other developers and see what's cooking at Yahoo!.  And it's all free!
