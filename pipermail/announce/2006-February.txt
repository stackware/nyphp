February General Meeting:
RSS, Atom, OPML, and All That: A Course for Developers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, February 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

This February, New York PHP Community explores the world of RSS and related
technologies. As PHP developers, we're often called upon to generate and
read dynamic feeds. Join us this month as author, professor and Java
developer - yes, Java developer - Elliotte Harold gives us an in-depth look
at these essential technologies.

XML based syndication is moving from its foundations in weblogs to
unexpected arenas: source code control systems, audio narrowcasts, e-mail,
bug tracking, stock tickers, and more. News readers like Vienna,
NetNewsWire, RSSOwl, and Newsgator are replacing classic web browsers for
many uses. This session explores the fundamental technologies underlying
this explosion of content: the various versions of RSS, OPML, Atom, and the
Atom Publishing Protocol. Learn the tricks and techniques for integrating
these XML applications into your products as both clients and servers.

Elliotte is originally from New Orleans to which he returns periodically in
search of a decent bowl of gumbo. However, he currently resides in the
Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn with his wife Beth and cats Charm
(named after the quark) and Marjorie (named after his mother-in-law). He's
an adjunct professor of computer science at Polytechnic University where he
teaches Java, XML, and object oriented programming. His Cafe au Lait web
site at http://www.cafeaulait.org has become one of the most popular
independent Java sites on the Internet, and his spin-off site Cafe con Leche
at http://www.cafeconleche.org has become one of the most popular XML sites.
His books include Java I/O, Java Network Programming, the XML Bible, and XML
in a Nutshell. He's currently working on the XOM Library for processing XML
with Java, the jaxen XPath engine, and the Amateur media player.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.
