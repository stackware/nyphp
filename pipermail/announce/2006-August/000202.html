August General Meeting:
NYPHP Talk Live
-----------------------

 When: Tuesday, August 22nd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

As the dog-days of summer draw to a close, New York PHP Community will be
trying something new for our August General Meeting. The NYPHP Talk Mailing
List is regarded as one of the premier technical and non-technical
discussion lists for the PHP and open source communities. This month, we
bring the mailing list to life by opening the meeting floor to those with
engaging questions and insightful viewpoints.

The format of this meeting will be quite different from the usual. Rather
than a single presentation, we're asking community members to come and speak
for no more than 5 minutes. These short &quot;lighting talks&quot; will be the basis
for further audience participation, discussion and Q&amp;A.

No slides or formal presentation material is required, and we encourage
everyone to come and start a discussion. Discussions will be moderated, and
capped at 30 minutes, at which point another lighting talk will be
presented. Here are some tips for asking the right questions:

    * Viewpoint and experience based questions and discussions are best

    * Feel free to come prepared with a couple of URLs or other online
material to help demonstrate your discussion points

    * Don't ask How-To questions: These are best left for the mailing list
itself

    * NYPHP Talk Live isn't an easy way to get technical help - don't come
with a list of homework questions. Think of broader, more engaging question
and discussion points

    * Technical discussion is encouraged, but think high school debate club
or model UN - not physics class or a spelling bee


No prior registration is required (except to RSVP), and we encourage
everyone to come with their questions and discussion starters. Laptops and
Internet access will be available to aid in discussion and for short
demonstrations.

Please join us this August as we break new ground, and help shape what could
be a regular occurrance for NYPHP Community meetings.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings are always
free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, August 22nd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
