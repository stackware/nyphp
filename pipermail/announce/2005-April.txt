New York PHP's own John Coggeshall, Technical Consultant for Zend
Technologies, will be presenting on his Tidy extension. This talk will focus
on introducing the new Tidy extension for PHP5 and how it can be used to
make working with and generating properly-formed HTML in a fast and
effective manner. Specifically this session will focus on:
 
* How to use Tidy to diagnose existing HTML for errors
* Using Tidy to clean and repair HTML documents
* An overview of the most useful Tidy options
* Using the Tidy OO interface to navigate the HTML doc tree
* Examples of how to navigate HTML effectively using Tidy
 
With the introduction of the Tidy extension, users will no longer need to
rely on messy regular expressions to mine data such as URLs, e-mail
addresses, or entire tables from HTML documents. Furthermore, thanks to the
diagnosing technologies provided by Tidy HTML documents can be diagnosed and
even corrected on the fly to ensure complete HTML or XHTML compliance before
being sent to the end user. This talk assumes users are familiar with basic
PHP object-oriented and procedural constructs.
 
Thanks to Dan Krook and Platinum sponsor IBM for providing a great
presentation space with seating for plenty. 
 
As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public. 
 
Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.
