NYCBUG Meeting Tonight
----------------------

July 7th Monthly Meeting: Brandon Palmer author of the book Secure
Architectures with OpenBSD, will be speaking.

6:00 pm, Soho Apple Store at 103 Prince Street

The OpenBSD operating system is a secure, stable, and powerful operating
system that is attracting many new and old UNIX users to it.  The
OpenBSD legacy is peppered with some ingenious security features
throughout the OS, and Brandon Palmer is extremely close to all of it.
Brandon Palmer will be giving a special overview of OpenBSD to the
NYCBUG attendees. Brandon's book received a rare 9/10 rating when
reviewed on slashdot, and this is sure to be a special NYCBUG meeting!

This July, join New York PHP's own David Mintz at our new IBM location
for an exciting followup to May's HTML_QuickForm by David Sklar. David
M. will expand on May's meeting and take us through using HTML_QuickForm
with the Smarty template engine.


Using HTML_QuickForm with Smarty

HTML_QuickForm is a PEAR package providing powerful and elegant
functionality for building and validating HTML forms. Its default form
renderer, however, is only adequate for the simplest of applications,
and customizing its output, though possible, is awkward and tends to
undermine the goal of separating logic from presentation. Smarty is a
popular template engine noted for its flexibility and efficiency, and
HTML_QuickForm supports integration with this and other template
engines.

In this presentation we quickly review the use of both tools, and then
examine some techniques for getting them to play nicely together.

David Mintz is a self-proclaimed wannabe geek who works as a
Spanish-English staff interpreter for the federal court in downtown
Manhattan.

Join David and the New York PHP crew and see how the powerful
HTML_QuickForm and elegant Smarty engine can be combined for engineering
the perfect frontend. IBM, our latest sponsor, has provided a great room
with seating for plenty.

Come prepared with a business card to enter drawings for book and other
prizes.

        When: July 27th, 2004 at 6:30pm sharp
       Where: (new location) IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 306 (3rd
Floor)
Post-Meeting: Outback Steakhouse, 919 3rd Avenue at 56th Street

Join us after the meeting for good food and discussion!
