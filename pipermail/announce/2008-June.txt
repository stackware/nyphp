June General Meeting:
Postgres Plus
---------------------

 When: Tuesday, June 24th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

It may be hot outside, but that's nothing compared to PostgreSQL and this
month's talk. We welcome back PostgreSQL core developer and EnterpriseDB
Senior Database Architect Bruce Momjian to discuss the latest about that
"other" open source database and what EnterpriseDB is doing to keep everyone
on their toes.

EnterpriseDB has produced a fully open source version of Postgres, called
Postgres Plus. Postgres Plus includes not just the database server but most
of the add-on packages that users need to use Postgres effectively in an
enterprise environment. This talk will focus on those additions and how they
are designed to increase Postgres adoption. The talk will also briefly cover
EnterpriseDB's Advanced Server, which adds Oracle compatibility to Postgres.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

When: Tuesday, June 24th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!
