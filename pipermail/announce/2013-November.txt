Calling all recruiters, HR departments, and job-seekers!
November 21st, 2013

This November we're going online with Videality to bring you the NYPHP
Virtual Job Fair.

Recruiters, hiring managers, and of course job-seekers are encouraged
to register and participate in this FREE online event.

Meet employers and candidates through a series of round-robin style
video interactions. Each participant will have a series of 8-10
meetings, where each meeting consists of a 5-minute live 1-on-1 video
conversation. At the end of the event, you'll receive contact
information for the people you've met, as well as any notes you've
saved about them.

Sign-up Now:  http://videality.com/session/detail?s=253

See you "there",
