April General Meeting:
Hacking PHP for Fun and Profit
PHP Internals and the C behind your PHP
---------------------------------------

         Date: April 27th, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/169 (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

It's April and we're pleased to spring into summer with LIPHP president and
PHP hacker Justin Dearing, to show us that there's more to PHP than first
meets the eye.

Most people in NYPHP can write in PHP. After all we are a PHP user group.
However, have you ever wanted to be one of the few and the proud that
actually help to write PHP itself. Justin Dearing will take you on a journey
from submitting a bug, to writing a test to prove the bug exists, to fixing
the bug on your machine. Finally he will show you how to submit that bug fix
to be considered for addition to PHP itself.

While hacking on the PHP core codebase requires a working knowledge of C,
non C programmers will benefit from learning how to write formal PHP tests,
and submit proper bugs.

Justin Dearing started his IT career in December of 2002 as the third shift
iSeries operator at InVision, now MindShift. Since then he has held a
variety of positions, and shifted from the operations to the development
side of the house. He is a PHP5 certified engineer.  Justin runs the Long
Island PHP User Group.  Justin blogs about programming on
www.justaprogrammer.net and his twitter updates can be followed from
http://www.twitter.com/zippy1981.

April General Meeting:
HipHop for PHP
Exploring Facebook's Hip New Version of PHP
-------------------------------------------

         Date: April 27th, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/170 (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

This April, we're pleased to welcome special guest and Facebook Open Source
Advocate Scott MacVicar speak on what could be one of the more significant
developments in PHP in recent memory - HipHop for PHP. HipHop is a
specialized and highly optimized version of PHP that serves the massive
traffic of the very hip Facebook.  So yes - hop over to this meeting and
stay hip with the latest PHP trends.

HipHop transforms PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then
compiles it using g++. It allows developers to continue writing complex
logical directly with PHP but leverages the speed benefits of C++. HipHop is
more than just a theoretical exercise and currently powers the majority of
Facebook servers. This session will cover using HipHop and some of the code
changes required to use it.

Scott MacVicar has contributed various extensions and improvements to the
PHP core over the past few years. If something is wrong with fileinfo, JSON
or SQLite3 it's likely something he did. He is also the current President of
the PHP London Usergroup and presents frequently at conferences on
databases, caching and scaling.

Scott is also the admin for the Google Summer of Code program and has
written numerous PHP articles. When not connected to the internet, Scott
runs marathons and cooks!
