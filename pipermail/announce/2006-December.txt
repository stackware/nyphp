Subject: [nycphp-announce] holiday@nyphp: This Week is the Holiday Party 2006
	- PLEASE RSVP
Message-ID: <006501c717c1$a2492ca0$0202fea9@MobileZ>


This year, NYCBUG and NYPHP are once again in cahoots for a holiday party -
with a twist. We'll have two 10 minute hard-nosed presentations to kick
things of and set the mood.

First, NYCBUG's Alfred Perlstein will speak on "Captchas can be LOL."

Then, NYPHP's Hans Zaunere will speak on "Unfashionable FreeBSD: Why Their
Threads Are So Last Year."

Then stick around for cash bar and food into the evening.

So join us:

    * Suspenders Restaurant (http://www.suspendersbar.com/directions.html)
    * Thursday, December 7th, 2006
    * 6:00pm - 9:00pm

Please RSVP to rsvp AT nycbug DOT org if you plan to attend.

NOTE:  There will likely be no General Meeting in December.

west side of broadway, immediately after the trinity church.

Subject: [nycphp-announce] presentations@nyphp: Do You Want To Present?
Message-ID: <000101c71bdd$145f70f0$650aa8c0@MobileZ>


All,

As many of you have seen, we have a submittal area for presentations where
folks can both submit talks, or request topics be covered.  Presentations
are submitted here:

http://www.nyphp.org/presentations.php

Recently, we've received a request for a presentation covering the area of
partitioning, RAID, and general disk setup for a AMP deployment.  This would
include:

-- a server for just the database
-- a server for just Apache
-- a server supporting the entire AMP stack
-- operating system specific considerations (Windows, BSD, Linux, etc)

If you'd like to present on one of these topics, or another topic, please
contact us:

http://www.nyphp.org/contact.php

We're happy to coorindate a meeting of multiple presenters, too.  Multiple
presenters are encouraged to talk on specific areas of expertise at a single
meeting.

We have a great new year ahead of us so join in and think about sharing your
expertise with the New York PHP Community.

In February, we're looking forward to an Eclipse/PHP update from Zend.
