New York PHP Presents...

July 22nd, 2003 @ 6:30pm at Digital Pulp, Inc.

"Parsing, Validating and Saving Data from Complex XML Streams"

Daniel Convissor provides lessons learned from developing tools for parsing SportsTicker's XML data.  SportsTicker transmits real-time sports scores, statistics and news in a continual stream, containing a wide variety of XML files. This month's presentation will cover the basics of using PHP's expat XML parser, easy validation routines and potentially helpful architectural tips.

Dan is the President of The Analysis and Solutions Company, a Brooklyn based web and database programming firm. He enjoys cycling, community activism and politics. These interests combine in interesting ways, such as his latest work: the BikeSummer 2003 website.

As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting and location details at http://nyphp.org  -  and please be sure to RSVP by sending a message to rsvp at nyphp.org so that we can better prepare.
