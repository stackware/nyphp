NYPHP Healthcare and Benefits
-----------------------------

Contact healthcare at nyphp.org if interested.  Details:

NYPHP is considering offering a benefits package to its members through the use of a Professional Employer Organization (PEO).  The National Association of Professional Employer Organizations' - http://www.napeo.org - states, "Professional employer organizations (PEOs) enable clients to cost-effectively outsource the management of human resources, employee benefits, payroll and workers' compensation."

Netting the whole thing out: interested NYPHP members would, in effect, "work" for two companies (i.e. Tax Id numbers); one would be the PEO, the other their own company.  The PEO would provide: health benefits, payroll services, and tax reporting services similar to a fortune 500 benefits package ( see http://www.trinet.com/services/benefits/benefits.htm for an example).  Interaction with the PEO package occurs through a portal. 

In order for us to get realistic proposals (e.g. price quotes), we need a show of hands who's interested.  If you'd like to explore this option, or have other suggestions for making this a success, please email healthcare at nyphp.org ASAP.

As a rough ballpark number ($75,000 annual salary) we're looking at ~ 

$600/mo individual
$975/mo individual+1
$1,200/mo family

for

Blue Cross PPO
Delta Dental Plan
Vision Service Plan
60% Salary Short term disability
60% Salary Long term disability
$50,000 Life Insurance
Payroll service (e.g. direct deposit and tax withholding)

NYC BSD *User Group
-------------------

>From http://nycbug.org...

---

We have initiated a BSD user group in New York City called NYCBUG (pronounced "nice-bug"). 

There are two goals for this new user group: 

First, to provide a forum for the many BSD users in New York City to discuss and debate topics of interest to the BSD community. 

Second, to provide a bridge to users interested in learning more about or expanding their knowledge of the BSD family. 

Our kick-off event will be a free "birds-of-a-feather" session at LinuxWorld Expo at the Jacob Javits Center on January 22nd at 5:45pm, Room 1E15. We will have a presence at various tables at the expo, including those of BSDMall and New York PHP. 

Our first presentation, "Secure by Default: Learning from OpenBSD," will be held on Wednesday, February 4th at 7:00pm in the offices of SageSecure, 116 West 23rd Street and 6th Avenue on the fifth floor. To be given by Wes Sonnenreich, author of "Building Linux and OpenBSD Firewalls" and "Network Security Illustrated," this talk will deal with crucial security concepts and best practices for today's computing environments. Subsequent meetings will take place at 7:00pm on the first Wednesday of the month. 

Our website is located at www.nycbug.org. The site will include a joint documentation project with New York PHP and OpenlySecure.org, focused on providing original documentation to new and experienced BSD users alike. NYCBUG also provides community mailing lists to assist in discussion and learning about the BSD world. Interested users join the mailing list at http://www.nycbug.org/mailinglist.html. 

NYCBUG is open to all interested individuals, including, but not limited to, users of FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, OpenDarwin, Darwin and Mac OSX. 

Since the origins of Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) UNIX in the 1970's, BSD has been a consistent force among the backroom servers of the world, powering internet service providers, hosting firms, and web sites such as Yahoo! and 2600.com. NYCBUG works to assist current users, those interested in learning more about this fundamental operating system family and various other BSD projects, and to provide a channel for community interaction. 

We look forward to supporting the BSD community in a variety of ways in the coming months and years. Please join us in making NYCBUG a success.

Oracle Installfest Covers PHP

c=1676088&src=1676088&Act=21

Oracle is holding an installfest at LinuxWorld and PHP will be a topic
covered.  There will be a table at Oracle's booth devoted to Linux
developers, and PHP/Oracle programming will be among the discussion.

If you've used Oracle and PHP, or just want to share expierences on
either topic, contact noreply at nyphp.org to join NYPHP at this exciting
event.  With Oracle Open Source developers onhand, this is sure to be
an informative session for all.


Tuesday: Setup and Volunteer Rendezvous
---------------------------------------

On Tuesday, two things need to happen.  First, those who can help
transport material from the East Side of Manhattan (Lex @ 27th Street)
to Javits should email noreply at nyphp.org.  We'll only need a couple
of hands - someone who can drive in the city with their car would be a
big plus.  We'll need to leave for Javits by 3:15pm.

At 4:00pm, everyone who will be helping with setup or needs free passes
will meet at the Statue of Jacob K. Javits (indoors) in the south
section of Javits Center, on the ground level.

We're happy for anyone to join us Tuesday but there might or might not
be that much to do, depending on how many people show up.


What If You Can't Meet Tuesday?
What If I Don't Know When I'll Be Available Yet?
------------------------------------------------

If you're unable to be there Tuesday, you can still get a free pass
during the rest of the show.  Every morning from 7:45am - 8:00am we'll
be handing free passes out at the Statue of Jacob k. Javits (indoors) in
the south section of Javits Center, on the ground level.

Anyone is welcome to join us in the .Org Pavilion at the NYPHP booth -
#5.  Wander in, say hello, and relax.  For instance, you could help
answer questions for two hours on one day, and 4 hours on another.
Regardless, please donate some time to the community.


Wednesday, Thursday, Friday: Staffing Booth #5
----------------------------------------------

Anyone is welcome to stop by the table and hang out, although we will
need some time commitment so the NYPHP booth isn't empty.

Zhou:       Wed 8:00 - 12:00
Mataka:     Wed 8:00 - 5:00

What To Expect When Staffing Booth #5
-------------------------------------

The atmosphere is relaxed and informal, with most time spent watching
people walk around.  However, foot traffic and questions can get quite
intense at times, so be prepared.

There's always need for people to answer questions - feel free to hang
around anytime.  Common topics include:

-- what is PHP?
-- what is PHP used for?  what can it do?
-- why is PHP better than language xxx
-- why have I heard PHP sucks and is insecure?
-- how can I learn more?
-- what is NYPHP?
-- how can I learn more about NYPHP?



I'd Want To Get Involved Or Bring Swag/Brochures To Booth #5

I had a great time and was sad to hear that this may be the last LinuxWorld
in New York City.  It definitely is my favorite show of the year.

These pictures are just of Friday.  If you have any pictures of the show you
would like to add-in, just send them to me and I will hang them.  

You can find the pictures here
