The New York Technical Community Holiday Party
----------------------------------------------
Details:  <A HREF="http://nyphp.org/nytchp.php">http://nyphp.org/nytchp.php</A>


Help spread the word!

New York PHP and the New York City *BSD User Group are proud to
announce the first annual New York Technical Community Holiday
Party.

Keep the evening of Wednesday, December 15th, 2004 open for the
first holiday party to embrace and network the entire New York
technical community.

This is not a PHP or BSD only event, and will include
participants from many technology sectors, including Java,
Linux, Perl, and .NET. We're working hard to make this event
embrace all technologies - not only open source - and our goal
is to combine free and commercial software in one professional
networking event.

Flagship sponsors New York PHP and NYC*BUG are bringing together
hundreds of technical professionals from the New York
metropolitan area for the New York Technical Community Holiday
Party. By uniting diverse skills and interests, open source
professionals, IT managers, and top authors and speakers, this
event begins a new era in technical, business, and social
networking.

Participants from large corporations, small businesses,
universities, non-profits, and user groups are all invited to
attend and bring significant others, co-workers, and friends to
this unique event.

Please forward this email to friends and colleagues.

Get a chance to connect with colleagues and share experiences
with others from your industry. Publishers, leading hardware /
software vendors, and local businesses and organizations will be
there, providing giveaways, presentations, and meetings. Enjoy a
free night of presentations from top authors and speakers,
talking with vendors, and networking in a relaxed social
environment with food and drink.

Bring your business cards to exchange and for raffle
opportunities.

Business casual attire is required.

 When:  Wednesday, December 15th, 2004 from 6:30pm to 10:30pm
Where:  Exclusive lounge space in Manhattan
 Cost:  Free, including complimentary beverages and hors d'oeuvres
  URL:  <A HREF="http://nyphp.org/nytchp.php">http://nyphp.org/nytchp.php</A>

All attendees must RSVP.  A reminder with complete details will
be sent prior to the event.
