This October join New York PHP and recognized author Chris Shiflett and special guest Geoff Young as they look at the interesting combination of PHP and Perl. Stop by our IBM location to see how these two languages complement each other for testing.

Testing PHP with Perl: Two Great Tastes that Taste Great Together

Lots of people use PHP for Web development. Lots of people use Perl for testing. Why can't we be friends? This fun but genuine talk will show how developers can use the power of the Apache-Test framework to improve the overall quality of PHP applications using Perl's mature testing tools and methodologies.

See Chris and Geoff demonstrate valuable new techniques, combining the power of PHP and Perl. Platinum sponsor IBM has provided a great room with seating for plenty.

        When: October 26th, 2004 at 6:30pm *sharp*
       Where: 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th floor)
