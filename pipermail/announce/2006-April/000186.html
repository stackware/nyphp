To keep our community in the know regarding the conference, here are some
new developments:

-- new sponsors onboard, Adobe and ActiveState, with others coming; be sure
to check the website for new developments

-- with so many great paper submittals, it's not going to be easy to choose,
but we will be making some pre-announcements shortly

-- and don't forget that the April 15th deadline isn't only for taxes - all
papers must be submitted by that date!

I'd also like to thank the broad community support we've received.  Special
thanks to Apache Friends (makers of XAMPP) and the phpMyAdmin project.  If
you know of a project that would like to take part, please have them contact
us.

And of course thank you to our commercial sponsors.  This conference has
really shown how open source projects and businesses can work together -
truly, the PHP Business Community.

Stay tuned for more news from the conference.
