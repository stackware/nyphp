<div>=A0</div><div>In the dead of summer, we&#39;re pleased to welcome Dani=
el Londero in from Italy to give us the low-down on agile development envir=
onment setup using Vagrant and Puppet.</div><div><br></div><div>In the past=
 years I&#39;ve been working on different kinds of development environments=
. From time to time there were improvements but there were always at least =
three big problems:</div>
<div><br></div><div>=A0 - long time set up</div><div>=A0 - difficult reprod=
uction</div><div>=A0 - &quot;It works for me&quot; issues</div><div><br></d=
iv><div>Nowadays developers can rely on tools like Vagrant and Puppet to au=
tomate creation and provisioning of development environments using the same=
 configuration of the production environment.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll talk about benefits of this approach for lone =
developers, teams and companies. I&#39;ll also show how it&#39;s easy start=
 using Vagrant from download to up and running with a simple introduction t=
o provisioning with Puppet.</div>
<div><br></div><div>By the end of the talk you&#39;ll learn how to help you=
r team to never ever say again &quot;It works for me&quot;.</div><div><br><=
