Hi all,

I'd like to let everyone know about our PHP Meetup organization efforts.

On the 1st Tuesday of every month, at 6:30pm, we'll be getting together at
Pound and Pence for an informal gathering of PHP, web, and open source
folks.

Details are at http://php.meetup.com/430/

These meetups will be the informal networking events to compliment our
continued monthly general meetings at IBM.

The first meetup is May 6th.  The venue might start to get packed beyond 50
attendees, so please RSVP at the site above so we have a rough count.

We're also looking forward to continuing these events through the summer and
in conjunction with other area groups.

Looking forward to meeting up with everyone at this first event, through the
summer, and beyond.

May General Meeting:
Know thy Enemy: Ruby on Rails for PHP Developers
------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, May 27th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

The birds and the bees are back once again, as is the droning buzz of Ruby
on Rails. Join us this month as we welcome back Avity LLC and RoR/PHP
developer Stephen Robinson.

Looking for a reality check on all that Ruby on Rails hype? What exactly is
it and how does it stack up to PHP? When should it be used, when not, what
should you tell your boss? If you're fed up of re-reading the same flame
bait blogs and want a cold headed detail rich understanding, this talk is
for you. We'll cover issues of performance, real world usage, interface
capabilities, architecture, scaling, deployment issues and more.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

When: Tuesday, May 27th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!
