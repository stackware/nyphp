Message-ID: <20041208132114.EAD9D99DC@mailrelay.t-mobile.com>


What an exciting December!

New York PHP will not be holding it's regularly scheduled December general meeting.  Instead, New York PHP has been working with NYC*BUG and others to co-sponsor a very special holiday party on December 15th.

Due to overwhelming response, we've had to close the RSVP list, and are expecting hundreds of attendees throughout the night.  However, NYPHP members should feel they are welcome to attend, and should contact contact at nytchp.org to request an extra seat.

Details are still available at http://www.nytchp.org

We also very much need volunteers from the user group community to help during the night of the event.  We already have a good core of people who have volunteered from NYC*BUG, but we need more, and we need your help.

Responsibilities will include 'working the door' and assisting in a number of specific tasks for the night.  Work will be light - please contact contact at nytchp.org ASAP
