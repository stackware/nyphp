Special Presentation:  Introduction to AMP at GNUbies Meeting
-------------------------------------------------------------------

   When:  March 10, 2004 at 6:30
  Where:  IBM Building, Manhattan
Details:  http://nyphp.org

As a special presentation, New York PHP President Hans Zaunere will introduce the powerful AMP Technology suite to the GNUbies group this Wednesday. From GNUbies.org:

We are pleased to announce that at this month's Gnubies meeting, Hans Zaunere, President and Founder of New York PHP will be giving a basic introduction to AMP - that is an extremely popular combination of software used for web servers and includes the Apache web server, the MySQL database and, in this case, the PHP programming language used for web scripting. When using GNU/Linux as the OS this is often referred to as LAMP. A basic explanation of each of these will be followed by a demonstration of a basic setup including compiling and configuration and then the writing of a simple web application. Clearly, since this is a GNUbies meeting these will not be covered in depth, but you will get a flavor of what can be done and a system will be set up and running during the presentation providing basic practical information as well.

As a freelance developer of GPS systems for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and other government organizations, Hans employed Open Source tools to massage and analyze geophysical data in 1995. While working as a network and systems administrator for a startup ISP, he discovered PHP and quickly migrated all modeling and monitoring tools to the web with the aid of Apache and MySQL.

In 2001 Hans moved to Manhattan and took responsibility for critical medical data as a systems architect at New York University. Then in 2002, he established New York PHP and AMP Technology to develop and promote this key technology suite. Today he continues to wear systems architect and administration hats, providing business solutions through Open Source.

As always, we are grateful to IBM for their generous donation of space for this mneeting. Please see http://gnubies.org for IBM's secuity measures for being admitted to the building or the meeting.

March Meeting
-------------

When: March 23, 2004 at 6:30pm
Where: Digital Pulp
Details: http://nyphp.org


As New York PHP reaches the second year mark, we're pleased to have two exciting presentations.


PAXI: PHP 5 and XML in Production

This month we examine a cutting edge PHP 5 and XML production implementation. New York PHP Principal Chris Hendry introduces the challenges faced and the PHP Application XML Interface (PAXI) solution.

This component based system utilizes the strength of PHP5?s SimpleXML and Hans Zaunere's pMime to establish a flexible architecture for working with a variety of web services, including SOAP-RPC. Instead of using the hefty PEAR framework, PAXI creates an extremely lightweight module-based structure for interfacing with web services in high traffic environments. Leveraging PHP's low-level socket and buffer functionality, PAXI parses, detects faults, and presents complex XML streams to a PHP 4 front end. PAXI is currently in production at CheapAirlines.com, among other high profile travel websites.

Join Chris, Hans and development team Dan Krook, Chris Snyder, and Adam Trachtenberg for an in-depth look at PHP 5 and XML in high traffic production environments.


JSCookMenu: JavaScript Menu System

JSCookMenu is a powerful menu script, written in JavaScript by Heng Yuan, that can mimic complex menus found in popular GUI Applications. Simple and easy to use, Gert Hilhorst demonstrates how he's implemented it for a web based investment accounting application.  With many menus and items, JSCookMenu has enabled Gert to deploy a user-friendly web application with a powerful AMP backend.

With fellow New York PHP Associate Felix Zaslavskiy, who assisted in debugging and development, Gert explores the combination of JavaScript and PHP.


 When: Tuesday, March 23th, at 6:30pm (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: Digital Pulp, Inc.  220 East 23rd Street, Suite 900 (9th floor)

As always this meeting is free and open to the public - please be sure to RSVP by sending a message to rsvp at nyphp.org.
