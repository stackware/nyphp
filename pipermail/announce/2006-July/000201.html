Thanks to Michael DeWitt for creating the gallery.

know:  <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.com/contact.php">http://www.nyphp.com/contact.php</A>



-- Our friends at NYCBUG (<A HREF="http://www.nycbug.org">http://www.nycbug.org</A>) are working on their own
conference, and their call for papers is open.  They have a lot of
interesting topics covered, so consider submitting or attending.  See
<A HREF="http://www.nycbsdcon.org/cfp">http://www.nycbsdcon.org/cfp</A> or view the announcement at the bottom of this
email.



-- Community Project - Andromeda Framework

Kenneth Downs recently announced the availability of Andromeda, a GPL'd
database-centric PHP framework.  Kenneth write:

&quot;This framework is heavily centered on database applications, and makes
large use of a data dictionary to drive most (sometimes all) of the
functionality.  It stresses not so much the management of code as the
elimination of code wherever possible.&quot;

NYCBSDCon 2006 Call For Presentations
-------------------------------------

Continuing on the success of last year, New York City BSD Conference
(NYCBSDCon) is the main technical conference on the East Coast for the
BSD community to get together to share and gain knowledge, to network
with like-minded people, and to have fun. This event is organized by
members of the New York City *BSD Users Group (NYC*BUG).

The NYCBSDCon program committee is accepting submissions for
imaginative, embryonic and energizing presentations surrounding the BSD
operating systems. We are looking to attract a wide range of speakers
and attendees; therefore, topics of interest range from the esoteric to
development to practical, everyday sysadmin life.

Topics of interest for the NYCBSDCon 2006 include, but are not limited
to:

       * Using the Andrew File System (AFS) in production
       * Large data management (large RAID, NAS, SAN, etc...)
       * Hands on Kerberos in enterprise environments
       * Network, server, and application security best practices
       * Network, server, and application monitoring
       * Patch management in large installations

For a recent discussion of topics, see our mailing list thread:
<A HREF="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.bsd.nycbug/3738/focus=3749">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.bsd.nycbug/3738/focus=3749</A>

Each talk is expected to be 45-50 minutes. Presenters will have
audio/visual and network connectivity.

Abstracts for presentations are due August 15, 2006.

Authors of accepted submissions should be able to provide the full
presentation for publication on the NYCBSDCon website. Further
instructions will follow the review process.  Submissions accompanied by
a non-disclosure agreement or a product advertisement will be rejected.

Abstract submissions should be emailed to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">cfp at nycbsdcon.org</A> in either
text, ps, pdf or like format, accompanied with a clear abstract.

Conference Location: Columbia University, New York, NY
Conference Dates: October 28-29, 2006

Important Dates:
August 15       Call For Presentation abstracts deadline
September 1     Accepted Presentations Notification
September 1     Registration Open
October 7       Presentations Due

Do not let travel and accommodation concerns get in the way of your
submissions; we may have some opportunities to subsidize.
