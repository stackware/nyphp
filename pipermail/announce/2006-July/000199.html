July General Meeting:
Presenting... the New Joomla! 1.5
---------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, July 25th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

More than just a name, Joomla! is the CMS formerly known as Mambo, which
continues to be a powerful and actively supported open source project.

Let Joomla! core developer (and NYPHP stalwart) Mitch Pirtle introduce you
to the new features and capabilities introduced in this release, which
includes a complete refactoring of the core systems. Joomla! has evolved
into a rich framework that facilitates rapid, featureful development with a
flexible and powerful API suited specifically for third party developers.

Learn about how the new system was designed, by both hearing anecdotes and
seeing examples provided by Mitch as he shows us the new API. He will walk
us through implementations of third party applications that provide case
studies on how to develop to the new API, providing examples of developers
leveraging the latest features and additions to the core.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, July 25th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
