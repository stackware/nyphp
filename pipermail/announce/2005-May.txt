Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20050507083634.020f1ec0@mail.optonline.net>

There are just a few days left to register for our next two-day in-depth 
PHP training class, scheduled for 16-17 May at our mid-Manhattan training 
facility.  This course will follow the Programmer's Track, focusing on 
developers with programming experience in other languages, but no 
experience with using PHP for web development.  Full details are at

Building Enterprise Applications with Mozilla, AMP, XML-RPC and JSON 
 
As a follow-up to his introductory presentation last year on connecting
Mozilla applications to a LAMP (or WAMP) backend using XML-RPC, Jay Sheth
will explain how to build large data-set applications on the same
combination of platforms.
 
A convincing desktop/web-application hybrid can be built using XUL,
JavaScript, PHP and MySQL by letting each component in this platform do what
it does best. XUL has a rich set of user interface widgets (editable combox
boxes, tabs, and so on) not found in HTML; thus XUL activated with
JavaScript enables easy data entry and modification. PHP is great at getting
data from external resources (local MySQL database, remote web service
gateways), processing it, and sending it back to the browser.
MySQL is great at storing, sorting and searching through data.
 
Jay will show how one can building a useful and usable rich web application
by focusing on and combining each component's strength.
 
But sometimes, even using each component's strength results in a solution
that is not as fast as desired. If the application is retrieving over 500
records at once, the main bottleneck is often the underlying transport
protocol. XML-RPC can facilitate communication between Mozilla and the AMP
backend, but also also proves to be resource intesive to parse on the
client-side. This is due to the verbose structure of its underlying XML
format. In order to speed up the retrieval of large chunks of data, the JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) format can be used instead.
 
With the help of source code examples and a real world application, Jay will
explain how to best use each part of the Mozilla + AMP platform, and how to
alternate between the XML-RPC and JSON data transports in order to create a
responsive, rich and useful web application.
 
Thanks to Dan Krook and Platinum sponsor IBM for providing a great
presentation space with seating for plenty.
 
As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Subject: [nycphp-announce] MySQL SIG Created
Message-ID: <200505211912.j4LJCtuJ019049@daedal.nyphp.com>


Due to Meetup.com's recent decision to charge for monthly meet-ups, New York PHP has decided to host a language agnostic SIG dedicated to MySQL developers and administrators.

Although hosted at New York PHP, this list is not specific to using MySQL with PHP.  Whether you develop with C, Java, .NET, Perl, Python, or any other language, the MySQL list supports you.  Non-development discussion, such as DBA and management topics, are also welcomed here.

No matter the topic, if it's relevant to MySQL in some way, this list supports you.

Subscribe at http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/mysql and see New York PHP's other SIGs at http://www.nyphp.org/lists
