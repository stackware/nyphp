<PRE>March General Meeting:
Becoming A Bash Ninja
---------------------

 When: Tuesday, March 24th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

It's March. Not much happens in March. Except, of course, for the March
General Meeting, where we're pleased to have karate kid Brian Dailey show us
how to slice through the original IDE - the command line. Even if you're an
avid GUI user, these techniques are always useful - and great at impressing
your friends - so join Brian and step up to get your own black belt.

The command line environment can be a powerful tool in a developer's
toolkit. Learning to use it well can make you a more productive and more
versatile developer.

This presentation is an introduction to the use of the shell as a
development environment. The talk will go over the basics of shell
navigation, including shortcuts that even seasoned CLI users may find
useful.

The presentation will also briefly cover some of the most useful tools
available to PHP developers: GNU screen for your multitasking needs, using
vim as and IDE, and automated deployment with Phing.

Brian Dailey has been using the command line since MS-DOS 5.0, making the
switch to Linux with Redhat 7.2. He is an independent consultant in the NYC
area bringing web based applications to the masses since 2001.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles.

 When: Tuesday, March 24th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend - that means RSVP
now!
