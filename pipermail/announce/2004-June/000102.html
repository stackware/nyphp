<PRE>
We have a very busy June meeting -

Please read this entire message as there is much new news!


June Meeting
------------

        When: June 22th, 2004 at 6:30pm
       Where: (new location) IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 306 (3rd
Floor)
Post-Meeting: Outback Steakhouse, 919 3rd Avenue at 56th Street

IMPORTANT: All attendees MUST RSVP by June 21st. IBM Security will not
let you in the building if your name isn't listed.

  Details: <A HREF="../../../index.html">http://nyphp.org</A>


This June, join recognized author and developer George Schlossnagle and
New York PHP at our new IBM location for an exclusive look at PHP 5 and
the advanced Object Oriented Programming techniques it provides.

After the meeting, you're invited to join us for food, drinks and
discussion at the midtown Outback - details below.


Object-Oriented Programming in PHP 5 Through Patterns

Anyone who's followed the development of PHP 5 is aware of the
excitement around the new object model. But what is it, and what does it
allow you to do? In this talk we'll examine the new OOP facilities in
PHP5 by looking at a number of design patterns and understanding the
features we need to support them.

George Schlossnagle is a contributor to the PHP project and an Apache
module author who also has years of hands-on experience in building
large-scale PHP sites and applications. He is the author of the APC
compiler cache and the APD profiler (Zend engine extensions for PHP), a
contributor to PHP, and is a regular speaker at leading open source
conferences such as PHP-Con and ApacheCon. He now runs a consulting
company specializing in scalable Web and email applications.

Join George to discuss the rapidly approaching PHP 5 and the exciting
features available for OOP. IBM, our latest sponsor, has provided a
great room with seating for plenty. Don't miss our kickoff event at IBM!

SAMS Publishing has been kind enough to provide us with books to raffle
off. Come prepared with a business card to enter the drawing.


        When: June 22th, 2004 at 6:30pm
       Where: (new location) IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 306 (3rd
Floor)
Post-Meeting: Outback Steakhouse, 919 3rd Avenue at 56th Street

Join us after the meeting for good food and discussion!

As always this meeting is free and open to the public - please be sure
to RSVP by sending a message to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">rsvp at nyphp.org.</A>

IMPORTANT:
All attendees MUST RSVP by June 21st. IBM Security will not let you in
the building if your name isn't listed.


New York PHP's First Meeting at IBM
-----------------------------------

It is with feelings of both anticipation and sentiment that I announce
New York PHP's move to IBM's midtown Manhattan building. For this and
all future meetings, New York PHP will meet at 590 Madison Avenue, at
57th Street.

Digital Pulp has been a fantastic host, and we wouldn't be here today
without Andrew Yochum and DP's dedication over the last two years. As
attendance has grown, however, we've come to need a larger facility. I'd
like to thank Dan Krook for making the IBM space possible.


Daniel Kushner's Last Meeting
-----------------------------

Lastly, New York PHP wishes to congratulate Daniel Kushner in his new
position at Zend Technologies as Director of Training and Certification.
He will be moving to California and this will be his last meeting.
Daniel has added a great deal to New York PHP since the beginning and we
will be sad to see him move

Daniel has also generously donated money for pizza and drinks at this
meeting, so please, join us to wish him the best.
