	the Week!
Message-ID: <004b01c927b2$f1e5c900$d5b15b00$@com>

FYI, from our good friends at NYCBUG (www.nycbug.org), coming up this weekend.  Certainly one of the finest technical line-ups for all things security, networks, and BSD.  Yet they still manage to make the measly $95 registration fee go back to the open source projects in donations.

Sign-up:  www.nycbsdcon.org

See you there,

Subject: [nycphp-announce] Nov4@nyphp: Lighten RIA with Adobe AIR,
	Flex & AMF (NOV 4TH)
Message-ID: <006301c92d3a$9737cf20$c5a76d60$@com>

October General Meeting:
Lighten RIA with Adobe AIR, Flex & AMF
--------------------------------------

 NOTE: This meeting is on NOVEMBER 4th.

 When: Tuesday, NOVEMBER 4th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

Scared of complex RIA applications and the brain eating zombie army of
acronyms like Ajax, AIR, Flex and AMF? For our October meeting, NYPHP and
Adobe stand together to cover all the ghoulish details of RIA, so you don't
lose your head this Halloween.

NOTE: This meeting is on NOVEMBER 4th.

AND stick around after the presentation for complimentary drinks and hors
d'oeuvres at TGI Fridays, thanks to Adobe.

Rich Internet applications (RIAs) are everywhere. With Web businesses like
Google and Yahoo! and brick and mortar companies like Harley Davidson and
Sherwin Williams embracing RIAs for their online presence, the media buzz is
giving way to the reality of a better Internet.

Adobe has recently contributed AMF support to the Zend Framework, allowing
PHP developers to easily build Rich Internet Applications using Flex and
Adobe AIR that interact with a PHP backend.

Kevin Hoyt, a technical evangelist with Adobe, will give an introduction to
Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR, and will walk through how to create a Flex
application powered by PHP and the Zend Framework. Working with Zend Studio
for Eclipse, and Flex Builder (an Eclipse plugin), Kevin will demonstrate
how to build, debug and deploy applications built with Adobe Flex, and how
to have these same applications run on the desktop using the Adobe AIR
runtime.

With this knowledge, developers will be able to easily build rich Internet
applications that combine data from PHP and rich media like audio and video
into a compelling application.

About Kevin:
I'm a Platform Evangelist with Adobe Systems, Inc. and I like lines.
Specifically, I like moving them, breaking them, blurring them and jumping
over them. If the lines form a box, that's even better because then I get to
think outside of them. Pushing the envelope of what technology can do, and
how people perceive and interact with it, is the name of my game.

I am a frequent traveler who enjoys meeting with developers, programmers,
architects, managers and anybody else involved with technology. Most of the
time you'll find me somewhere in the United States speaking at conferences,
user groups, or anywhere else they'll give me time in front of an audience.
The rest of the time I enjoy spending with my family at home in Parker, CO.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, NOVEMBER 4th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!
