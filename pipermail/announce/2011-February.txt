February General Meeting:
CouchDB: JSON, HTTP & MapReduce
Introducing noSQL and the Document-oriented Database with PHP and CouchDB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, February 22nd, 2011 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/180 (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

February is all about relationships. Classically, databases have been too,
being the matchmaker that maintains structure in the lives of data. But
these modern times accept a more promiscuous data, with the noSQL movement
putting data in the unrestrained document. One such libertine, CouchDB, has
developers tickled-pink with its Apache backing, performance, and
flexibility. This month, NYPHP welcomes Burlington PHP co-founder and noSQL
indulger Bradley Holt to enamor us with this new technology, and determine
if noSQL will be your development shop's next - valentine.

CouchDB is a document-oriented database that stores JSON documents, has a
RESTful HTTP API, and is queried using MapReduce views. Each of these
properties alone, especially MapReduce views, may seem foreign to developers
more familiar with relational databases. This presentation will demystify
the basic concepts behind CouchDB and give web developers a practical guide
to getting started with CouchDB. We'll discuss how CouchDB relates to other
SQL alternatives and what makes CouchDB unique.

Bradley Holt is a web developer, entrepreneur, community facilitator, and an
advocate of free/open source software, open standards, and open content
(e.g. Creative Commons). He has ten years of experience with PHP and MySQL
and is a Zend Certified Engineer in Zend Framework (ZCE-ZF) with three years
of experience building Zend Framework applications. He is a contributor of
source code and bug reports to Zend Framework and an active member of the
PHP community having attended ZendCon '08, '09, and TEK-X. He is the
co-founder and organizer of the Burlington, Vermont PHP Users Group and is
involved with helping to organize other technology community events such as
Vermont Code Camp. He is the author of the upcoming book, Writing and
Querying MapReduce Views in CouchDB (O'Reilly) and is currently writing a
second book on scaling CouchDB.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

March Special Presentation:
Asset Management and Image Manipulation in PHP 5.3
Managing Javascript, CSS and Images in Object-Orientated PHP 
------------------------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, MARCH 1ST, 2011 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: Suspenders Restaurant, 111 Broadway (ask Hostess)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/182 (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: Stick around for networking and PHP cheer.

Join us for this special March doubleheader. In addition to our regular 4th
Tuesday March meeting, which will be announced shortly, we're pleased to
have Kris Wallsmith and Bulat Shakirzyanov walk us through their
in-production techniques for better managing the ubiquitous web asset
problem.

NOTE: This meeting is at Suspenders on March 1st - RSVP is still required.


-- Introducing Assetic: Asset Management for PHP 5.3

The performance of your application depends heavily on the number and size
of assets on each page. Even your blazingly fast PHP 5.3 application can be
bogged down by bloated Javascript and CSS files. This session will give you
a basic introduction to PHP's new asset management framework, Assetic, and
explore how you can integrate it in your projects for a pleasant, common
sense developer experience.

Kris is a member of the core team of the Symfony Framework, Symfony Guru at
OpenSky, and long-time advocate for simple solutions to complex problems. He
works from his home office in Portland, Oregon where he and his wife raise
their three young children.



-- Introducing Imagine: Image manipulation for PHP 5.3

Whenever I need to make image thumbnails, or some other simple
manipulations, it becomes a huge pain as the low level PHP APIs for image
manipulation are hard to work with and very diverse. In this talk I will
explain how Imagine brings all of them together in a nice high-level OO API
mostly inspired by Python's PIL and other image manipulation libraries.

Bulat Shakirzyanov is software alchemist at OpenSky, member of the Doctrine
Project core team, holds a black belt in test-fu, Symfony2 fan and
contributor, geek and talks about himself in third person.
