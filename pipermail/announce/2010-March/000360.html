<PRE>March General Meeting:
Coding for Mobile Web Applications
Developing for SmartPhones and the iPhone
-----------------------------------------

         Date: March 23rd, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/166">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/166</A> (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

Spring is finally in the air, and with it comes the fresh topic of mobile
web application development. We're pleased to have Trevor Seeney give us a
breath of fresh air, for this increasingly hot topic.

In this session you will learn some tricks for maximizing use of a phone's
screen space, changing page layout automatically to meet browser
requirements, using presentation APIs such as Google Charts, and get
guidelines on writing server-side functions specific to mobile computing.
Although the supplied examples aim at iPhone web apps, the techniques can be
applied to any smartphone web interface.

The session will showcase a demonstration iPhone Widget written in PHP, that
is Debt Calculator and presents in graphical form, the payment terms and
total payment amount of three differing debt resolution methods (demo
online).

By mobilizing your apps, you'll let your users be effective from more
locations, making them more responsive to changing business conditions.

Trevor Seeney is an experienced software developer and technology
consultant. Trevor's recent experience has been focused on developing
web-faced applications using PHP and RPG-ILE against MySQL and DB2 databases
respectively. In recently developed applications, the AJAX technology has
been deployed along with the more familiar HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

Trevor's current focus is rendering enterprise data and metrics onto
smartphones with a particular emphasis on the iPhone.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.
