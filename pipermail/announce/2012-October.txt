     Location: SailThru (12th fl), 160 Varick St. New York, NY 10013

As a special presentation, we welcome Juozas Kaziukenas to give us the
latest on a key PHP framework, Symfony2.

If you don't know what Symfony2 is, you *have* to come, you can even
ignore the remainder of this abstract. On the other hand, you might
have heard of this new framework called Symfony2, but never got a
chance to use it. This talk goes through the main futures and benefits
of Symfony2 framework and most importantly tries to apply them to
practical use cases and how those would be solved. In the end, you'll
leave with a better understanding of why this framework (arguably)
currently has the fastest growing user base and very likely you'll
join it too.

Juozas, or as everyone calls him Joe, is an experienced and talented
(some say) young professional, entrepreneur and evangelist. Focusing
on bringing IT solutions to non-technical businesses, like retail, he
works on optimizing their processeses and using cutting-edge research
to solve hard problems and grow sales. When not working, Joe finds
time to contribute to open-source projects and movements to improve
interoperability and platform independence. His hands-on practice with
collection of different technologies, programming languages and
environments allows him to deliver unbiased and practical
presentations in all kind of different topics.
