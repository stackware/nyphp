Message-ID: <20030123025816.26645.qmail@web12801.mail.yahoo.com>


Today was the first day of exhibits at LinuxWorld Expo 2003, and although
they say the economy is weak, you wouldn't know it by attending the show. 
The floor was packed with all the major IT companies (yes, even Microsoft),
and the crowd was thick from 10:00-5:00.

The UNILUG booth was a buzz of activity, and NYPHP was right in the middle of
things.  Thanks to all who stopped by today, and especially the staffers
behind the booth.  And of course a big thanks to Doron Gerstel, CEO, Zend
Technologies for fielding questions, and Sterling Hughes for the book raffle.

Tomorrow the show continues, and those who didn't get a chance to stop by
today are encouraged to do so tomorrow or Friday.  If you're interested in
staffing the UNILUG/NYPHP booth tomorrow, please contact me at
noreply at nyphp.org.  I will also be in and around the booth throughout the day
and Friday afternoon.

Thanks to Michael, Adam and Kayra for pictures.  If there are any other
pictures out there, let me know and we'll include them in the photo gallery
after the expo.

Special thanks to UNILUG for reserving the booth and letting NYPHP be a part
of it.

Best,

Good evening,

I'd like to thank everyone who stopped by the UNILUG/NYPHP booth.  It was
great meeting all of you, some old, many new.  If our booth at LWE is any
indication, PHPCon should be fantastic.  After a couple of weeks, we plan to
get PHPCon planning underway.  There's a lot to be done, but I think with the
support we've seen so far, there should be no problem, and if anyone wants to
lend a hand, there's tons to be done.

And of course a big thanks to Daniel, Daniel, Michael, Adam and Fil for
helping out with everything over the last couple of days.

We have three book raffle winners:

-- David Chan
-- Peter Lehrer
-- Carl Romano

We will bring the books to our next meeting, this Tuesday, 1/28/03 at 6:30pm.
 If you can't make it Tuesday, please let me know, and we can try to work
something out.

Best Regards,

New York PHP Presents...

January 28th, 2003 @ 6:30pm at Digital Pulp, Inc.

"Building a Scalable Architecture with PHP"
"High Performance PHP"
PHP Job Opportunities

Presented by Community Connect's CTO Mike Montero and Chief Architect Dan
Cowgill, these talks are for those interested in PHP internals, performance
and enterprise PHP development.  Few know PHP like these guys, so you won't
want to miss their insight.

And then, join Community Connect Recruiter David Dankin to explore the PHP
job market and check out available positions at CC.  What a great way to
start a year!

One important note, however, is that NYPHP monthly meetings have been moved
to the 4th Tuesday of the month (1/28/03).

As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting
and location details at http://nyphp.org  -  and please be sure to RSVP at
http://nyphp.org/rsvp so we can prepare enough seating and drinks (thanks to
Oddcast).

I'd also like to point out NYPHP's new job board.  It's still developing, but
going strong.  Check it out at http://jobs.nyphp.org and send your available
positions to jobs-submit at nyphp.org.


Thank you,
