March General Meeting:
Object Relational Mapping with PHP
----------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, March 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

With technologies like Hibernate and active record models blinking on many
of our radar screens, the idea of mapping objects to relational databases is
something we all need to consider. New York PHP Community's March
presentation features one successful implementation and discusses some of
the key concepts involved. Join us this month as development lead Ed Kozek
looks at these rapid and streamlined application development techniques.

Ed Kozek is the Director of UI Development at Right Media where the front
end is written entirely using LAMP technologies in a clustered environment.

Ed will explore the use of object oriented programming concepts to map
database tables to PHP objects. He will talk about how his company used
abstract classes (and extensions of them) to build easily configurable
objects that update and read from tables. Often tables represent not just
collections of data, but actual business objects, so he'll show how he added
hooks into these classes that do things like validation, data filtering, and
logging. This helps keep lots of the business logic in one place, and also
out of the front end of the application.

This presentation should be useful to PHP developers who are still new to
some of the less-used OOP capabilities in PHP, and also to anyone looking
for a cleaner way to update and read from DBs using PHP.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, March 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
