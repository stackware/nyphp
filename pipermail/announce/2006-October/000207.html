October General Meeting:
The Andromeda Framework
------------------------

 When: Tuesday, October 24th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

The world of PHP frameworks and Content Management Systems is a vibrant area
of development, with new and evolving projects making news every day. In
recent meetings we've had a number of PHP framework and CMS presentations,
including Joomla! with Mitch Pirtle and CakePHP with Nate Abele. This month,
we'll continue our review of this industry hotspot with project lead Kenneth
Downs presenting The Andromeda Framework at the October New York PHP General
Meeting.

Andromeda is a GPL'd software automation tool primarily targeted for complex
line-of-business database applications, but also has been used for smaller
scale data-driven websites. Its primary design goal is to store business
rules as data instead of code, and to eliminate code rather than to manage
the coding process. Andromeda is written entirely in PHP, runs on Linux, and
targets the PostgreSQL database.

Kenneth Downs began programming professionally in 1992. His first project
was a Vax/VMS based accounting and manufacturing system. He worked from
1995-2004 in the Foxpro world, first doing LAN apps and then Client/Server,
working from small 5-user systems to being system architect on an ERP system
with deployments of hundreds of users. He founded Secure Data Software July
1, 2004 to develop and use the &quot;Andromeda&quot; project, a database-centric
open-source development framework and toolset.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings are always
free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, October 24th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
