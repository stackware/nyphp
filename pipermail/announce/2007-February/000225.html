February General Meeting:
Eclipse PHP Project and Zend Platform 3.0
-----------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, February 27th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)

It may be cold outside, but there's nothing like a good IDE to keep a
programmer cozy. And at this February meeting, New York PHP Community is
pleased to have Yossi Leon of Zend warm us up to a double-shot of their
latte-no-foam solutions - Eclipse PHP IDE and Zend Studio.

In the last year Zend and IBM started a new project called PHP IDE. This
project is the official project from Eclipse organization for the PHP
language. The idea of the project is to provide a framework in order to
build a PHP development environment (as any other project of Eclipse which
is a framework) on top of it. The project stable version (0.7) will be
released on February 2007. In the session we will talk about Eclipse, the
short history of the project and a demonstration of the features.

In the second (and the short) part of the session I will demonstrate the new
cool features of Zend Platform 3.0 and the integration with Zend Studio 5.5.

Yossi Leon is the project leader of the Eclipse PHP IDE. In addition, he is
also the development tools product manager at Zend Technologies. He has many
years of experience in the design and implementation of application
development environments as well as a deep knowledge and understanding of
Quality Assurance and Packaging processes. Yossi holds a B.A in Computer
Sciences and is currently studying for MBA.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, February 27th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
