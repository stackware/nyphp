     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)

February is all about relationships. Classically, databases have been too,
being the matchmaker that maintains structure in the lives of data. But
these modern times accept a more promiscuous data, with the noSQL movement
putting data in the unrestrained document. One such libertine, CouchDB, has
developers tickled-pink with its Apache backing, performance, and
flexibility. This month, NYPHP welcomes Burlington PHP co-founder and noSQL
indulger Bradley Holt to enamor us with this new technology, and determine
if noSQL will be your development shop's next - valentine.

CouchDB is a document-oriented database that stores JSON documents, has a
RESTful HTTP API, and is queried using MapReduce views. Each of these
properties alone, especially MapReduce views, may seem foreign to developers
more familiar with relational databases. This presentation will demystify
the basic concepts behind CouchDB and give web developers a practical guide
to getting started with CouchDB. We'll discuss how CouchDB relates to other
SQL alternatives and what makes CouchDB unique.

Bradley Holt is a web developer, entrepreneur, community facilitator, and an
advocate of free/open source software, open standards, and open content
(e.g. Creative Commons). He has ten years of experience with PHP and MySQL
and is a Zend Certified Engineer in Zend Framework (ZCE-ZF) with three years
of experience building Zend Framework applications. He is a contributor of
source code and bug reports to Zend Framework and an active member of the
PHP community having attended ZendCon '08, '09, and TEK-X. He is the
co-founder and organizer of the Burlington, Vermont PHP Users Group and is
involved with helping to organize other technology community events such as
Vermont Code Camp. He is the author of the upcoming book, Writing and
Querying MapReduce Views in CouchDB (O'Reilly) and is currently writing a
second book on scaling CouchDB.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.
