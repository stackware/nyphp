April General Meeting:
Web 2.0 and RESTful Applications with WebSphere sMash and PHP
-------------------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, April 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

It's April and spring is here (or at least it's supposed to be). So it's
time to take a RESTful break from the monotony and join our IBM crew as we
welcome Roland Barcia, IBM Senior Technical Staff Member and published
expert on the latest in Web 2.0 techniques. Join us and get sMash'd with
knowledge about the very latest in Web 2.0 applications, WebSphere, and PHP.

IBM WebSphere sMash is a platform for developing and running agile Web
applications using scripting languages and Web 2.0 technologies such as
RESTful Web services, JavaScript Object Notation, and Atom and RSS feeds. It
supports the Groovy language, familiar to Java programmers, and PHP for
access to thousands of PHP applications and libraries,and the huge PHP
developer community. IBM WebSphere sMash is focused on significant
improvement in time-to value for Situational Applications and Mashups.
Partners and community have found that by combining PHP applications and
libraries with new code written in PHP or Groovy for the IBM WebSphere sMash
platform, they can achieve significant reduction in development time for
Situational Applications and Mashups. We cover an overview of the PHP
support in IBM WebSphere sMash and the support for generating new PHP code
before exploring more detailed scenarios demonstrating PHP Applications
being extended, integrated and mashed up.

Roland Barcia is a Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM) and Lead Web 2.0
Architect within IBM Software Services for WebSphere. He is the coauthor of
the book IBM WebSphere: Deployment and Advanced Configuration. He has
published over 40 articles and papers on topics such as Java Persistence,
Ajax, REST, JavaServer Faces, and Messaging Technologies. He frequently
presents at conferences and customers on various technologies. He has spent
the past 10 years implementing middleware systems on various platforms,
including Sockets, CORBA, Java EE, SOA, and most recently the Web
2.0[nd]based platform called Project Zero. He has a Masters Degree in
Computer Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Roland
maintains a blog called Web 2.0 and Middleware at

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings

	drink
Message-ID: <176c01c9bde6$94efefd0$becfcf70$@com>

As many know, NYPHP also runs a PHP meetup as the informal compliment to our
monthly meetings.

And we've got a very special meeting coming up - read all about it:

http://www.meetup.com/new-york-php/

Join for location details. These events are always free, and in May,
complimentary food and drink will be provided.

Our May meet-up is May 14th so that we can welcome special guest Sigurd
Magnusson of the SilverStripe CMS (http://www.silverstripe.com) from New
Zealand.

SilverStripe is hitting the USA East coast in May, with co-founder Sigurd
Magnusson keen to meet developers and organizations interested in our
software and business. You will get to learn the story behind SilverStripe,
influence our upcoming decisions, ask pointed questions, and get a preview
of new features!

And FREE beer and d'oeuvres will be served - thank you to SilverStripe for
sponsoring this meetup!

Sigurd will take about 30 minutes to review the CMS and then do Q&A with the
group. Then, time permitting, we'll move onto our Beer Review segment, with
5-10 minute topics from our community. Here's the breakdown:

6:15pm - 6:30pm - Networking and topic submission
6:30pm - 7:00pm - Silverstripe CMS
7:00pm - 7:30pm - Beer Review topic discussion

We have reserved a private backroom at a restaurant, with an LCD, free
wireless, and seating for about 40 people.

Presentation topics:
-- general questions/answers about PHP or anything AMP
-- review/analysis of a problem or existing solution

Come prepared with your presentation topic!

Please arrive by 6:30pm and if you have a topic you'd like to discuss,
arrive prior to 6:30pm.

See you there!
