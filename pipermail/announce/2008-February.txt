White-Hat SEO in PHP

Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

2008 rolls on, and what would a year be without a talk on SEO. This month
we're pleased to have David Fischer speak on his company's experiences when
dealing with the craft of SEO and the science of PHP.

David Fischer of Avity LLC will speak on "white-hat" Search Engine
Optimization, with a focus on technical issues relating to SEO for PHP-based
sites. He will present an overview of the "three legs of the SEO stool" with
a focus on the technical leg - how coding decisions can affect search
rankings.

David has 10 years of experience in technology. He has built and sold two
web startups and is the founder and principal of Avity, a full-service web
design and software company with a staff of 25. He holds a B.A. with
distinction in Computer Science and Economics from Yale University.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.
