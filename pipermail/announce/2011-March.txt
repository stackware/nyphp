Join us for this special March doubleheader. In addition to our regular 4th
Tuesday March meeting, which will be announced shortly, we're pleased to
have Kris Wallsmith and Bulat Shakirzyanov walk us through their
in-production techniques for better managing the ubiquitous web asset
problem.

NOTE: This meeting is at Suspenders on March 1st - RSVP is still required.


-- Introducing Assetic: Asset Management for PHP 5.3

The performance of your application depends heavily on the number and size
of assets on each page. Even your blazingly fast PHP 5.3 application can be
bogged down by bloated Javascript and CSS files. This session will give you
a basic introduction to PHP's new asset management framework, Assetic, and
explore how you can integrate it in your projects for a pleasant, common
sense developer experience.

Kris is a member of the core team of the Symfony Framework, Symfony Guru at
OpenSky, and long-time advocate for simple solutions to complex problems. He
works from his home office in Portland, Oregon where he and his wife raise
their three young children.





-- Introducing Imagine: Image manipulation for PHP 5.3

Whenever I need to make image thumbnails, or some other simple
manipulations, it becomes a huge pain as the low level PHP APIs for image
manipulation are hard to work with and very diverse. In this talk I will
explain how Imagine brings all of them together in a nice high-level OO API
mostly inspired by Python's PIL and other image manipulation libraries.

Bulat Shakirzyanov is software alchemist at OpenSky, member of the Doctrine
Project core team, holds a black belt in test-fu, Symfony2 fan and
contributor, geek and talks about himself in third person.

March General Meeting:
PHP in the Cloud with AWS and RightScale 
Developing, managing and deploying LAMP in the cloud

March is usually a pretty quiet month around NYC - well except for St.
Patrick's Day. This month the luck o' the Irish comes to NYPHP as we look at
the shenanigans of cloud computing and application development - from a
developer's viewpoint. Join senior NYPHP leprechaun Max Gribov as he reveals
the shams and shamrocks of AWS and RightScale and we follow he lucky charms
through the clouds - to the pot o' gold at the end of the rainbow.

You may also tune-in Tuesday at 6:30pm:

This talk will cover developing and managing Amazon Web Services and
RightScale AWS Management Application from small startup perspective, and
how to use AWS Services with RightScale AWS Management Application. In
addition, the talk will focus on
RightScale tools, such as Server Templates, Auto-Scaling Arrays and
RightScripts - and how these were used to build an infrastructure for load
testing of our application. I will walk through all steps of setting up a
new RightScale AWS deployment - from provisioning and customizing servers to
deploying and monitoring the application - hopefully demystifying some buzz
surrounding the cloud along the way.

Max Gribov has worked in technology since the first .com bubble, wearing all
manner of hats, from helpdesk, to network engineer to PHP developer.
Currently, he is a developer and operations engineer for a small
below-the-radar startup which uses AWS to host the application and
RightScale to provide management and support.

Max thinks all technology should just magically work at all times, but keeps
getting burned by reality of complex systems, which keeps him entertained
and gainfully employed.
