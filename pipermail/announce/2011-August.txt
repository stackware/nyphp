After a relaxing July, we're pleased to wrap the summer up with a look at a
new package management system for your application.  This August, join phpBB
core developer Nils Adermann for the next generation of application
management.

Unsatisfied with the status quo of PHP package managers, we set out to
research tools used in other environments like Node.js' npm and Ruby's
Bundler. Based on our findings, we created Composer, a PHP package manager
that fulfills our requirements. For dependency resolution, in particular, we
settled on writing a SAT solver inspired by the one used in zypper, SUSE's
RPM installer. This talk discusses the theoretical concepts behind Composer
and shows you how to manage your next PHP project's dependencies with it.

contributing to phpBB for the past 6 years. He has taken over the lead
developer position in 2010 to modernize the forum software and turn it into
a Symfony2 application. He studies computer science at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology (KIT) and worked on AI research for humanoid
robotics.
