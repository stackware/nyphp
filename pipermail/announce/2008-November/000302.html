<PRE>We're stuffing November with another great presentation. This time we're
pleased to host Sun/MySQL with Duleepa Wijayawardhana and Giuseppe Maxia on
two of the hottest topics - as in pumpkin pie - social applications and
performance.

Join this special event at the Suspenders Bar and Restaurant for a great
talk from the technical leaders at Sun/MySQL.

 NOTE: This meeting is NOT at IBM and on 11/12/08. RSVP is not required, but
arrive early
       as space is limited.

 When: Wednesday, November 12th at 6:30pm sharp

Where: Suspenders Bar and Restaurant (www.suspendersnyc.com)
       111 Broadway at Thames Street, back meeting room


-- Writing a Social Application with PHP/MySQL
   And what happens when a million people show up on opening day

Imagine you've decided to create a social application for the web. Imagine
that contrary to popular belief amongst all your peers, you've managed to
find the secret missing ingredient to social networking and a million people
show up, 990,000 more than you thought would actually bother. We'll discuss
real life scenarios where that actually happened to me and all the lessons
learned &quot;on the job&quot;.

Some of what we will go into:

- Creating Social Applications with PHP/MySQL and how it's changed over the
years.

- The difference between High Performance and High Availability in an
application and database.

- Identifying the pain points in an application.

- Using MySQL features to scale an application.

- Building the ability into your application and database to scale including
the use of memcached.

- Some details and/or introduction to using XDebug, Explain and monitoring.

Consider this a fun interactive talk filled with many horror stories of the
amazing things that go wrong in real life when you've thought you've planned
well.

This talk can cover as much technical detail as needed!

Duleepa Wijayawardhana (Dups) is MySQL's newly minted North American
Community Relations Manager and was plucked from the clutches of MySQL Web
Team where he has worked for the last 1.5 years. The Web Team manages the
external web sites of MySQL which draw a considerable amount of web traffic.

Before joining MySQL, Dups worked for game developer BioWare Corp. in
Edmonton, Canada where he helped develop and run the extremely popular
BioWare Community Site (Neverwinter Nights Community), BioWare Store, and
various other web properties as well as Manager for BioWare's Application
Support Team.

 NOTE: This meeting is NOT at IBM and on 11/12/08. RSVP is not required.

 When: Wednesday, November 12th at 6:30pm sharp

Where: Suspenders Bar and Restaurant (www.suspendersnyc.com)
       111 Broadway at Thames Street, back meeting room

Post-Meeting: Enjoy food, drink and discussion after the presentation at the
Suspenders Bar and Restaurant
