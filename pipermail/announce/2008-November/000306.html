<PRE>November General Meeting:
Coding Secure with PHP and Enterprise LAMP Security
---------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, November 25th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

What would another November meeting be without cliche turkey jokes? Security
isn't just gravy for web developers, but trying to understand all the latest
buzzwords will make you feel like you're running around without a head. This
month, New York PHP Managing Member Hans Zaunere provides a cornucopia of
best practices and simple security fundamentals that will prevent you from
being the turkey. Given originally at OWASP's AppSec Conference, join NYPHP
and get the buckshot you need to knock the stuffing out of that wiley script
kiddie.

Anyone involved in web application development over the last five years
should be aware of the security ecosystem surrounding PHP. Often overhyped,
sometimes dramatic, and always interesting, the topics of PHP and security
are usually linked at the hip, and a favorite comedy topic for those
involved with other languages.

While PHP has made some security mistakes in the past, the focus of
criticism is often misguided. The applicable codebase for the security
notices - whether it be the PHP core, an extension, or an application - is
forgotten and PHP as a whole gets one more strike.

PHP also provides great power and flexibility. But with it, comes great
responsibility. As with any application living on the internet, it's the
entire support staff's responsibility architect, developer, and
administrator - to ensure an application meets organization security
requirements.

In this talk, Hans Zaunere, Managing Member, New York PHP, provides tips,
tricks, and fundamental best practices from the trenches for ensuring your
code and LAMP deployment isn't caught off guard. He'll then review the PHP
security ecosystem and available resources, debunk myths, and reveal some
surprising facts that could leave you thinking PHP is one of the most secure
languages available today.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles.

 When: Tuesday, November 25th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend - RSVP Now!
