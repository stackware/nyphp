May General Meeting:
Beyond Mashups: Situational Application Runtimes using PHP
----------------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, May 23rd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

We're less than a month away from the New York PHP Conference. And what
better time to explore enterprise mashups. We're pleased to have David
Boloker, CTO of Emerging Technology in the IBM Software Group, and his team
back to discuss how PHP can be used to enable the building and running of
situational applications.

Do you buy into the hype around mashups? Given the maturation of SOA, could
there be merit in the recent ramp up of a mashup ecosystem? Consider the
predicted yearly growth rate of over 900 new mashups a year. The listing of
hundreds of such Web 2.0 composite applications on The Programmable Web also
factors into the viability of this emerging web technology. Assuming that
the ad-hoc situational aspects of mashups are here to say, what will the new
breed of mashup developers require from a web application runtime?

Developing humongous applications that try to solve many possible situations
of a given subject domain is no longer the prudent approach for web based
solutions. Now it is more efficient to enable application users with the
ability to establish flexible ad-hoc short-term applications that adapt to
the needs of the moment quickly and easily.

A Situation Application is a web application that meets the following
criteria:

 * It is rapidly created to address an immediate need of an individual or
community.
 * It is a Just-in-time solution that is typically but not necessarily
short-lived.
 * It is informal thus lacking product quality look and feel.
 * It provides a &quot;just good enough&quot; solution as opposed to a generalized
solution.

A Mashup can be a form of a Situation Application that yields a new utility
by seamlessly combining content from more than one sources into an
integrated experience. Mashups are comprised of 2 or more disparate
components that are bound together through content.

Join us this month as we hear from David Boloker, CTO of Emerging Technology
in the IBM Software Group. David and his team will present IBM's PHP based
Wiki platform for situational applications and provide a general update on
IBM's PHP strategy, contributions, and upcoming products.

The primary focus of this briefing will be IBM's introduction and
demonstration of their application runtime for situational applications.
Referred to by the codename, QEDWiki (more), this technology enabler seeks
to improve the ways in which the knowledge worker interacts and integrates
with the overwhelming amount of information they face in our fast past
information driven world. QEDWiki represents a next generation Wiki which
combines Do-It-Yourself IT (DIY-IT) with the flexibility of user-oriented
information architecture to create an easy-to-use integration platform for
rendering mashups.

QEDWiki is an application runtime environment for collaborative and
situational (ad hoc) dynamic content development. It enables quick and easy
web programming and deployment of Wikis for non-programmers who are domain
experts. Once the IT community sets up the basic Wiki, individual groups can
quickly aggregate, deploy and collaborate based upon their requirements. As
a result, minimal maintenance is required from IT.


Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter giveaways.

Thank you to Adobe for providing Dreamweaver 8.  Bring your cards!
