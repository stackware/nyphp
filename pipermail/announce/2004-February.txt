   OpenBSD Security, Wes Sonnenreich on Wednesday, February 4th at 7 pm.

   While operating system security is a hot topic in the news today,
only
   one operating system can say that it's only had one remote
   vulnerability since its inception in 1996: OpenBSD.

   With a stringent auditing process and the committment of developers
   around the world, the OpenBSD example has transformed the way in
which
   operating system security is viewed.

   Wes Sonnenreich is the author of "Building Linux and OpenBSD
   Firewalls" and "Network Security Illustrated." His presentation will
   look at the OpenBSD operating system, and the the clear lessons it
   teaches about building secure systems.

   The meeting will be held at the offices of SageSecure, LLC at 116 W.
   23rd Street at 6th Avenue on the fifth floor.

   This meeting is free and open to the public.


We kindly endorse the distribution of this announcement among your
colleagues, and potential *BSD users. Thank you.

February Meeting Program
------------------------

When: February 24, 2004 at 6:30pm
Where: Digital Pulp
Details: http://nyphp.org

February's General Meeting continues the database thread started with last month's PostgreSQL presentation by introducing PEAR DB.

PEAR DB is an object oriented API that provides common methods of accessing thirteen of PHP's database driver extensions.

Daniel Convissor, NYPHP speaker and PEAR DB's current lead developer, presents this month's meeting with highlights of the new version 1.6.0 release. The main points will be major bug fixes, API changes and new portability features that make it possible to write programs that will work with a wide variety of DBMS backends.

As always this meeting is free and open to the public - please be sure to RSVP by sending a message to rsvp at nyphp.org.


Get Published in PHP Magazine
-----------------------------

PHP Magazine and New York PHP have partnered to offer our members a unique opportunity for helping the PHP community... and earning a few bucks.  As a NYPHP member, write book reviews and articles for *the* PHP publication:

-- Book Reviews
   The latest books (some that haven't even been released yet) are sent to your door, free of charge, and reviews are submitted online.

-- Are you an expert on one of these topics?
   1. PHP5's New mysqli extension
   2. DB Management with MySQL GUI tools - special focus on the new
      MySQL Administrator
   4. Taking a project from a blank page and an incoherent set of
      end-user requests and making sense of the madness with good
      object / data modeling and clean reusable code (kind of a 'best
      practices' article).
   5. PHP 4 to PHP 5 - Migration Annoyances: An article that would detail
      in an 'annoyance/solution' manner the migratory issues that developers
      will face when moving from PHP 4 to PHP 5, and their
      respective solutions.

   Or, have an interesting topic of your own?


Please contact contact at nyphp.org for more details or to get started.  Compensation is available for accepted articles and reviews.  The next deadline, March 5th, is fast approaching, so please contact us ASAP.
