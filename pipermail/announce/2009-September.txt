September General Meeting:
The Code of Open Source Licenses
 - Comparing the Art of Programming with Legalese
-------------------------------------------------

         Date: September 22nd, 2009 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP  (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

Wow, what a great summer that was.  It's hard to believe that was called
"summer" and that we're in the *bers of 2009 already, and it's even harder
to believe how similar legal and contract writing is to programming.  But
let's face - you're either programming a computer system, or programming a
legal system.  This September, we're looking forward to a one-of-a-kind
talk, and pleased to have Charles B. Kramer, Esq. speak on the fundamentals
of licenses and intellectual property (IP) of the software world and how, in
fact, legalese is just another form of programming.

A software license is like source code -- it should contain consistent
definitions, processes that branch upon "if/then" conditions, and
predictable consequences when one or another event triggers termination.
Once you learn what the "code" of a well structured license looks like,
you'll be  able to distinguish between a license that is confusing because
it's difficult, and one that's confusing because it's just poorly drafted.

Subject: [nycphp-announce] special@nyphp: Mobile Data: How to Avoid the
	Latency Trap When Using Web Services

Special Presentation:
Mobile Data: How to Avoid the Latency Trap When Using Web Services
------------------------------------------------------------------

Full details at http://www.nyphp.org/

As a pre-cursor to the Yahoo! Open Hack Day, we're pleased to have a special
presentation from YDN Senior Developer, Tom Hughes-Croucher.

NOTE: RSVP is not required but please arrive early to reserve a seat.

Why is mobile different to desktop? When it comes to data there are lots of
difference such as processing and most importantly data transmission. Our
goal as developers should always be to make the fastest apps possible,
however mobile adds a lot of constraints to the platforms we are used to
developing for on the desktop. This talk will focus how you can avoid the
problems that network latency creates by being smart with your server
implementation.

Tom Hughes-Croucher is an Evangelist and Senior Developer in Yahoo's Open
Strategy Group, focusing on Yahoos Web Services and Cloud Platform. Tom has
contributed to a number of Web standards for the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) and the British Standards Institute (BSI). Previously he helped build
the online music stores for some of the UK's largest brands including Tesco,
Three Telecom and Channel 4.
