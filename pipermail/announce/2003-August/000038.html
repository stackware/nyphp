New York PHP Presents...

August 26th, 2003 @ 6:30pm at Digital Pulp, Inc.

&quot;Parsing, Validating and Saving Data from Complex XML Streams&quot;

Daniel Convissor provides lessons learned from developing tools for parsing SportsTicker's XML data.  SportsTicker transmits real-time sports scores, statistics and news in a continual stream, containing a wide variety of XML files. This month's presentation will cover the basics of using PHP's expat XML parser, easy validation routines and potentially helpful architectural tips.

Dan is the President of The Analysis and Solutions Company, a Brooklyn based web and database programming firm. He enjoys cycling, community activism and politics. These interests combine in interesting ways, such as his latest work: the BikeSummer 2003 website.

As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting and location details at <A HREF="../../../index.html">http://nyphp.org</A>  -  and please be sure to RSVP by sending a message to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">rsvp at nyphp.org</A> so that we can better prepare.



--- New York PHP:  Special Interest Groups

We've seen a lot of interest in specialized areas over the last couple of months.  To help foster these types of developments and programs, New York PHP has formed two special interest groups (SIGs), with more to come.

New York Front End:  NYFE is dedicated to the coding and development with key front end technologies, such as CSS, JavaScript, Flash and HTML.  Headed up by NYPHP Directory Dan Krook, a page is in development and a mailing list already available for public use.  See <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end">http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end</A> for discussion, technical support, and SIG developments.

Education:  As we move into the fall and people are back to school, New York PHP wants to support AMP Technology in area schools, and promote special workshops and events for the education community.  With dozens of interested members already volunteered, we're now looking for a SIG Director to lead this effort.  Please contact <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">contact at nyphp.org</A> if you'd like to take part in this vital initiative.


Thank you,

New York PHP
