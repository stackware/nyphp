Join Edward Kietlinski, Zend Technology Sr Consultant, for a look at how
Zend Server 5.5 helps streamline the application deployment process and
helps bring consistency and automation to the entire application lifecycle.

If it seems like your agile development workflow is stuck in molasses
because deployment problems and manual steps are slowing down the process,
then this is a good way to improve rollouts and become even more agile. If
you're already trying out the Zend Server trial, you'll learn how to
leverage its application deployment features, and if you're not, you'll
learn how to take it for a test drive.

We will also showcase Zend Developer Cloud, part of Zend's PHPCloud.com
technology preview that was announced at last Zendcon conference. Zend
Developer Cloud, as its name suggests, is a cloud-hosted dev environment
designed to help you code more quickly and more efficiently. It includes a
robust PHP stack, advanced debugging capabilities, collaboration tools and
much more. Zend Developer Cloud takes only a few clicks to get started and
does not require any server installation but is tightly integrated with Zend
Studio 9. To make it even better, PHPCloud.com is absolutely free!

Read the full description, details, and RSVP at <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/">http://www.nyphp.org/</A>

As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings are always
free and open to the public.
