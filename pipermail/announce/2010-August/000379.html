August General Meeting:
Designing HTTP URLs and REST Interfaces with PHP
RESTful APIs with JSON, XML and HTTP
------------------------------------------------

         Date: MONDAY August 30th, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/174">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/174</A> (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

August in the city - what a glorious time. This August, we're pleased to
have special guest David Zuelke join us for a look at the vital techniques
and technologies involved in REST interfaces and APIs.

IMPORTANT: This month's meeting is not on Tuesday - it's Monday the 30th.
Normal RSVP procedures still apply.

A lot of Web Services today claim to be RESTful APIs. But are they really?
Do the URLs form a logical hierarchy, and do they accurately identify
resources? Are the powers of HTTP leveraged properly? What is &quot;hypermedia&quot;,
and what is the secret behind the HATEOAS acronym that is so essential to
the REST architectural style? This talk gives answers and guidelines using
real-life examples.

David Zuelke is the lead developer of the Agavi project, an open source MVC
framework for PHP, and managing director at Bitextender GmbH, a Munich,
Germany based software company. He has been doing PHP development for more
than ten years and regularly speaks at conferences around the world.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
