Sphinx is a standalone open source search server with incrediblly fast
full-text and other search functions, including geo-spatial distance
support and more. It also combines both native NoSQL functionality and
MySQL protocol compatibility.

In this talk, we'll explore Sphinx's power, walk through key
integration steps in a PHP environment, look at how to efficiently
build the most popular services to support high-load and scalability.

The Sphinx development team brings great new features every few months
and in the second part of the talk, we'll look at running Spinx in
cloud environments and explore more of the most recent features in the
upcoming 2.1.x version.

Vladimir is helping people to grow their websites by scaling,
optimizing and eliminating performance bottlenecks on different
levels. In the past he worked with high-performance systems as a
developer and team leader. He is currently providing consulting for
both MySQL and Sphinx. In his off-duty time he's enjoying bicycling,
travel, and photography.
