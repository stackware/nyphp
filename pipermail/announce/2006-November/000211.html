November General Meeting:
NYPHP-Talk Live
-------------------------

 When: Tuesday, November 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

Still sleepy from the tryptophan, New York PHP Community again presents
NYPHP-Talk Live for our post-Thanksgiving November General Meeting.

NYPHP-Talk Live, which we first did for our August meeting, is an open
forum, giving the community a chance to ask questions, voice their opinions,
and interact in person. The NYPHP Talk Mailing List is regarded as one of
the premier technical and non-technical discussion lists for the PHP and
open source communities. NYPHP-Talk Live brings the list to life by opening
the meeting floor to those with engaging questions and insightful
viewpoints.

The format of this meeting is very different from the usual. Rather than a
single presentation, we're asking community members to come and speak for no
more than 5 minutes. These short &quot;lighting talks&quot; will be the basis to spark
further audience participation, discussion and Q&amp;A.

No slides or formal presentation material is required, but a projector will
be available, and we encourage everyone to come and start impromptu
discussion. Discussions will be moderated, and capped at 30 minutes, at
which point another lighting talk will be presented. Here are some tips:


    * Viewpoint and experience based questions and discussions are best

    * Feel free to come prepared with a couple of URLs or other online
material to help demonstrate your discussion points

    * Basic how-to questions will have a lower priority


NYPHP-Talk Live isn't an easy way to get technical help - don't come with a
list of homework questions. Think of broader, more engaging question and
discussion points. While technical discussion is encouraged, be mindful of
material that is more appropriate for in-person discussion, rather than the
mailing list.

No prior registration is required (except to RSVP), and we encourage
everyone to come with their questions and discussion starters. Laptops and
Internet access will be available to aid in discussion and for short
demonstrations.

With a successful NYPHP-Talk Live alpha release over the summer, join us
again for our second release this November.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings are always
free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

 When: Tuesday, November 28th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
