Full-Text Search with Sphinx and PHP
SphinxSearch LAMP stack integration, tips and tricks
----------------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, May 24th, 2011 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor) 
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/187">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/187</A> (all attendees MUST RSVP)

Sphinx is an open source search server which combines very fast full-text
search with a great scalability. It's growing up fast and we not only
inventing new features for full text search itself, but also creating new
ways to integrate Sphinx into PHP based applications.

You may also tune-in Tuesday at 6:30pm:

If you are not yet using Sphinx, we'll be highlighting some key steps on how
to serve Full-Text queries to your PHP based applications from start to
finish. If you are an advanced Sphinx Search user, this talk will describe
where one can offload MySQL or standard Database functions to Sphinx. From
some specific queries one can run on the Sphinx to how to increase both
performance and scalability of your applications (web-based or otherwise).

Besides tips and tricks centered around integration with PHP/MySQL based
applications, you will learn about the recent 2.0.1 release straight from
the proverbial 'horse's mouth.' This talk will utilize and focus on
real-world examples from installation and integration to handling search
results.

Vladimir Fedorkov is a Director of Support and Consulting at Sphinx
Technologies. In his day-to day work he assist users in growing their
websites/applications by providing expertise on scaling, optimizing and
eliminating performance bottlenecks on many different levels. In the past he
was worked with high-performance systems as a developer and team leader.
Before joining Sphinx he worked at Percona.
