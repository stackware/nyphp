March General Meeting:
NYPHP Talk Live
----------------------

 When: THURSDAY, March 29th, at 6:30pm
Where: Suspender's Bar and Restaurant (<A HREF="http://www.suspendersbar.com/">http://www.suspendersbar.com/</A>)

It seems as though spring is in the air, and with it comes a new type of
meeting event at New York PHP Community. This month, we'll continue our
NYPHP Talk Live series, but at a bar/restaurant venue for informal
discussion, drinks, and food.

We'll have the back room of Wall Street area bar and restaurant,
Suspender's.  Free wireless internet is provided, in addition to a LCD
projector.

Bring your discussion topics, laptops, and appetites as the NYPHP Talk
mailing list goes live this March.  We welcome 5 minute and ad-hoc
presentations by anyone to serve as discussion starters, and as a way to
share your experiences with the community.

NOTE: This event occurs on March 29th (Thursday), rather than our normal
Tuesday meeting.  There is no need to RSVP.  The event starts at about
6:30pm.
