<PRE>June General Meeting:
Building Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) with Silverlight &amp; PHP
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, June 23rd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php">http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php</A>

Even though Mother Nature may not know it's June, it is, and time for our
June meeting.  We'll welcome back Peter Laudati and Microsoft, to give us a
refreshing &quot;summer&quot; refresher on the Silverlight and PHP play.

In March 2007, Microsoft introduced Silverlight to the market as a new
platform for developing rich internet applications. Silverlight is a
cross-browser, cross-platform, and cross-device plug-in for delivering the
next generation of media experiences and rich interactive applications for
the Web. By using various tools, designers and developers can collaborate
more effectively using the skills they have today to light up the Web of
tomorrow. Silverlight is a client-side technology with no dependencies on
the Microsoft web stack (.NET). Therefore, it can be a perfect complement to
PHP applications.

Come join us as we take a tour around Silverlight, including its
capabilities, how to develop Silverlight applications, and the tools used.
We'll also talk about how you can use Silverlight together with PHP to take
user experiences to the next level!

And join us at TGI Friday's at 56th and Lexington after the meeting for FREE
food and drink, thanks to Microsoft.

Peter Laudati is a Developer Evangelist with Microsoft. In his current role,
Peter works with the developer community in New York and New Jersey to
support area user groups, code camps, and other events. Previously, he
worked as a consultant in Microsoft's services division. As a consultant, he
worked on several application development projects and provided
architectural guidance for large customers throughout the NY &amp; NJ metro
area. He lives with his family in central New Jersey and loves kayaking and
biking at the Jersey Shore. His blog can be read at

Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings

Come prepared with a business card to enter book and software raffles.

 When: Tuesday, June 23rd at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
