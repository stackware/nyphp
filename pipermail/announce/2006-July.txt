July General Meeting:
Presenting... the New Joomla! 1.5
---------------------------------

 When: Tuesday, July 25th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

More than just a name, Joomla! is the CMS formerly known as Mambo, which
continues to be a powerful and actively supported open source project.

Let Joomla! core developer (and NYPHP stalwart) Mitch Pirtle introduce you
to the new features and capabilities introduced in this release, which
includes a complete refactoring of the core systems. Joomla! has evolved
into a rich framework that facilitates rapid, featureful development with a
flexible and powerful API suited specifically for third party developers.

Learn about how the new system was designed, by both hearing anecdotes and
seeing examples provided by Mitch as he shows us the new API. He will walk
us through implementations of third party applications that provide case
studies on how to develop to the new API, providing examples of developers
leveraging the latest features and additions to the core.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

Message-ID: <004801c6b004$fb1eb810$740aa8c0@MobileZ>


Hello,

We have a couple of notes from around the community that we'd like to share.


-- Presentations this Fall:  We're calling for presentations for NYPHP
monthly meetings.  Would you like to present, or know someone who would?
Let us know:

http://www.nyphp.org/presentations.php

We also have a new training schedule for the Fall.  See:

http://www.nyphp.com/training/



-- NYPHPCon's 2006 Gallery, Presentations, and Reviews are Online
	http://www.nyphpcon.com

Thanks to Michael DeWitt for creating the gallery.

Have content - like pictures or reviews - that you'd like to add?  Let us
know:  http://www.nyphp.com/contact.php



-- Our friends at NYCBUG (http://www.nycbug.org) are working on their own
conference, and their call for papers is open.  They have a lot of
interesting topics covered, so consider submitting or attending.  See
http://www.nycbsdcon.org/cfp or view the announcement at the bottom of this
email.



-- Community Project - Andromeda Framework

Kenneth Downs recently announced the availability of Andromeda, a GPL'd
database-centric PHP framework.  Kenneth write:

"This framework is heavily centered on database applications, and makes
large use of a data dictionary to drive most (sometimes all) of the
functionality.  It stresses not so much the management of code as the
elimination of code wherever possible."

NYCBSDCon 2006 Call For Presentations
-------------------------------------

Continuing on the success of last year, New York City BSD Conference
(NYCBSDCon) is the main technical conference on the East Coast for the
BSD community to get together to share and gain knowledge, to network
with like-minded people, and to have fun. This event is organized by
members of the New York City *BSD Users Group (NYC*BUG).

The NYCBSDCon program committee is accepting submissions for
imaginative, embryonic and energizing presentations surrounding the BSD
operating systems. We are looking to attract a wide range of speakers
and attendees; therefore, topics of interest range from the esoteric to
development to practical, everyday sysadmin life.

Topics of interest for the NYCBSDCon 2006 include, but are not limited
to:

       * Using the Andrew File System (AFS) in production
       * Large data management (large RAID, NAS, SAN, etc...)
       * Hands on Kerberos in enterprise environments
       * Network, server, and application security best practices
       * Network, server, and application monitoring
       * Patch management in large installations

For a recent discussion of topics, see our mailing list thread:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.bsd.nycbug/3738/focus=3749

Each talk is expected to be 45-50 minutes. Presenters will have
audio/visual and network connectivity.

Abstracts for presentations are due August 15, 2006.

Authors of accepted submissions should be able to provide the full
presentation for publication on the NYCBSDCon website. Further
instructions will follow the review process.  Submissions accompanied by
a non-disclosure agreement or a product advertisement will be rejected.

Abstract submissions should be emailed to cfp at nycbsdcon.org in either
text, ps, pdf or like format, accompanied with a clear abstract.

Conference Location: Columbia University, New York, NY
Conference Dates: October 28-29, 2006

Important Dates:
August 15       Call For Presentation abstracts deadline
September 1     Accepted Presentations Notification
