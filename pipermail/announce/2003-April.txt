New York PHP Presents...

April 22nd, 2003 @ 6:30pm at Digital Pulp, Inc.

"Zeev Suraski: Open Q&A Session and Enterprise PHP Solutions"

New York PHP is delighted to host Zeev Suraski, Co-founder and CTO Zend
Technologies, at a very special April meeting. An avid software architect,
Zeev co-authors PHP's driving force, the Zend Engine, and contributes many of
the vital APIs that makes the language what it is today. Through the Open
Source development model, Zeev contributes key extensions to the PHP Group
and community. Few know PHP like Zeev, on both technical and operational
fronts.

Join New York PHP this month as Zeev sits down with us for an open Q&A
session and walks us through Zend's PHP enterprise offerings. If you've ever
asked "Can PHP do that?", "Is PHP ready?" or "What's next?" you'll want to
join us this month, for definitive answers from PHP central developer and
architect, Zeev Suraski.

As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting
and location details at http://nyphp.org  -  and please be sure to RSVP by
sending a message to rsvp at nyphp.org so we can prepare enough seating and
drinks.

Thank you,
