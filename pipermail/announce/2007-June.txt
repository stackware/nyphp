June General Meeting:
Rich Internet Applications and PHP
----------------------------------

 When: THURSDAY, JUNE 28th, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

NOTE: This meeting is NOT on the 4th Tuesday. It occurs THURSDAY, JUNE 28th
at our usual IBM meeting location.

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

Summer 2007 is finally here, and with it comes the web's sunny future. Rich
Internet Applications (RIA) have experienced several technical iterations
over the years, but finally appear to be sticking as the next generation
application platform. This June, New York PHP is pleased to have Justin
Girard speak to the Ajax, Flash, Flex, XUL, WPF - and PHP - relationship.

NOTE: This meeting is not on the 4th Tuesday. It occurs Thursday, June 28th
at our usual IBM meeting location.

Justin will present what developers are doing to design rich Internet
applications for the Web that combine the best of traditional graphical user
interface applications with the wide reach of Web-based access.

He will discuss how seamlessly rich client technologies like Ajax, Flash,
Flex, XUL and WPF can work together with minimal recoding, eliminating the
need to re-start projects from scratch. He will show examples of PHP and
non-PHP based applications with a variety of front ends. He will also
provide links to a number of PHP projects that can help speed PHP RIA
development.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.
