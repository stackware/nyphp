New York PHP Presents...

March 25th, 2003 @ 6:30pm at Digital Pulp, Inc.

New York PHP Celebrates One Year
"Introducing PHP 5"

Only a year has passed since New York PHP formed, putting us in a very
exciting time for all things PHP. With the unwavering support of so many,
NYPHP has become an icon of PHP development and community. Thank You.

There's no better way to celebrate than with a look at the future of PHP. 
PHP 5 is expected to be ready for primetime by year's end, and with it will
come a new level of Internet pragmatics and functionality. Sporting a copious
set of new and enhanced features, including a distributed and revised
extension system, PHP 5 employs the Zend Engine 2. With an evolutionary
refinement of its Object Model, ZE2 will provide a robust and efficient
framework for developing PHP applications, and the revolutionary prospect of
native support and integration of Java, COM and .NET components.

Join us this March as PHP core developer Sterling Hughes gives us an in-depth
introduction to the future of PHP.


As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting
and location details at http://nyphp.org  -  and please be sure to RSVP at
http://nyphp.org/rsvp so we can prepare enough seating and drinks.

PHP and AMP Technology Training is now available for the Tri-State area,
April 21-22.  Please see http://nyphp.org/training.php for details.

Thank you,

Good afternoon,

Continuing in our effort to deliver concise, timely and pertinent
information, New York PHP is pleased to announce the first installment of New
York PHP News.

It is available online:  http://news.nyphp.org/nyphp.mar03.php

To avoid cluttering your Inbox with separate news postings from each source,
we've digested every topic from a variety of resources, including MySQL,
Apache, Zend, O'Reilly and more, plus AMP Technology community news and
developments - all in a simple index format.  This is only the first edition
(please excuse any formatting or date discrepancies) and we are working hard
to deliver a much enhanced version for April.

We are anxious to hear what resources you'd like included and ideas you have
to improve NYPHP News.  And if you have publishing/newsletter experience,
please consider contacting news at nyphp.org and getting involved.


Thank you,
