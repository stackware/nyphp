SilverStripe CMS (www.silverstripe.org) is an open source CMS designed to be
modern, intuitive, and capable of running government and business websites.
It's also the friend of the PHP developer because at the heart is Sapphire,
an MVC framework written in PHP 5. Co-founder Sigurd Magnusson is visiting
from New Zealand and will give a preview of material to be presented at the
upcoming Chicago CMS Expo Learning and Business Conference (cmsexpo.net)

We have reserved a private backroom at a restaurant, with an LCD, free
wireless, and seating for about 40 people.

Presentation agenda:
  - Overview of SilverStripe CMS and Sapphire framework.
  - Roadmap for 2011: SilverStripe CMS v3.0, and Sapphire as a stand-alone
MVC framework.
  - Software usability and interaction design in an open source model.
  - Q&A.

Sphinx is an open source search server which combines very fast full-text
search with a great scalability. It's growing up fast and we not only
inventing new features for full text search itself, but also creating new
ways to integrate Sphinx into PHP based applications.

You may also tune-in Tuesday at 6:30pm:
  -- http://www.ustream.tv/channel/new-york-php

If you are not yet using Sphinx, we'll be highlighting some key steps on how
to serve Full-Text queries to your PHP based applications from start to
finish. If you are an advanced Sphinx Search user, this talk will describe
where one can offload MySQL or standard Database functions to Sphinx. From
some specific queries one can run on the Sphinx to how to increase both
performance and scalability of your applications (web-based or otherwise).

Besides tips and tricks centered around integration with PHP/MySQL based
applications, you will learn about the recent 2.0.1 release straight from
the proverbial 'horse's mouth.' This talk will utilize and focus on
real-world examples from installation and integration to handling search
results.

Vladimir Fedorkov is a Director of Support and Consulting at Sphinx
Technologies. In his day-to day work he assist users in growing their
websites/applications by providing expertise on scaling, optimizing and
eliminating performance bottlenecks on many different levels. In the past he
was worked with high-performance systems as a developer and team leader.
Before joining Sphinx he worked at Percona.
