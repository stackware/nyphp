IBM's PHP Strategy
 
Join us this month as we hear from David Boloker, CTO of Emerging Technology
in the IBM Software Group. Dave and his team will speak about IBM's PHP
strategy, contributions, and upcoming products.
 
The team from IBM will also discuss the recent Zend Technologies partnership
and demonstrate some PHP applications and extensions that are in the works.
This meeting promises to be a great opportunity to ask questions about IBM's
PHP roadmap.
 
The presenters will cover the following topics:
 
IBM's PHP Strategy (David Boloker)
- Why PHP
- The Zend relationship
- What are we doing and where are we going
 
PHP Technologies and IBM (Stewart Nickolas) 
- PDO status and efforts
- Web services
 
Composite Applications using Mambo (Dan Gisolfi)
- Building composite applications with open source components and frameworks
 

Thanks to Dan Krook and Platinum sponsor IBM for providing a great
presentation space with seating for plenty.
 
As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and
open to the public.
 
Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.
