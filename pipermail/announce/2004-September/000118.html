Zend PHP Certification Marathon, Exclusively for New York PHP Members

The Zend Mobile Test Center is coming to town!

Zend Technologies and New York PHP have worked together to create a
unique PHP Certification Marathon in New York City exclusively for New
York PHP Members. A mobile test center will be set up at one of New York
PHP's training centers in midtown Manhattan on September 27th, one day
before the General Monthly Meeting.

Not only will you be able to take the test with your friends and peers,
but the developer with the highest score will win a Palm Pilot the next
day at the NYPHP meeting.

It doesn't stop there - Zend will invite all participants to a beer at
the post-meeting hang out!

What are the next steps?

1) Send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">certification at zend.com</A> requesting to sign up (seats
are limited).
2) Pay the reduced rate of $100 (instead of the regular $200) for the
exam.
3) Run to Barnes and Noble to get a copy of the PHP Certification Study
Guide.
4) Learn all week (you can send questions to the NYPHP-Talk List).
5) Show up at the mobile test center at your designated time.
6) Pass the exam and maybe win a Palm Pilot.
7) Come join us for a free beer at the post-meeting New York PHP hang
out.

Sign up now, seats are limited - Contact <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">certification at zend.com</A> to get

New York PHP kicks off a full fall meeting schedule with a look at
PHP-GTK by New York PHPer and active developer Joel De Gan.  Join us in
September at our IBM location and learn about PHP on the desktop with
the revitalized GTK extension.

Skinable and Portable Desktop Applications with PHP-GTK

Take PHP-GTK to the bleeding edge by creating functions and using
existing ones to generate applications that are skinnable and dynamic.
Joel will also be taking skinning and the PHP-GTK to it's limit by
showing a new skeleton engine for building dynamic maps for games in
PHP-GTK using sprites.

Join Joel and New York PHP to see some exciting new code and techniques
with PHP-GTK.  Information on PHP-GTK isn't always easy to come by so
you won't want to miss this presentation and opportunity to speak with
Joel.  Platinum sponsor IBM has provided a great room with seating for
plenty.

APress and Sams have provided a great selection of books for meeting
attendees. Come prepared with a business card to enter the raffle.
