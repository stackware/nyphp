New York PHP kicks off a full fall meeting schedule with a look at
PHP-GTK by New York PHPer and active developer Joel De Gan.  Join us in
September at our IBM location and learn about PHP on the desktop with
the revitalized GTK extension.

Skinable and Portable Desktop Applications with PHP-GTK

Take PHP-GTK to the bleeding edge by creating functions and using
existing ones to generate applications that are skinnable and dynamic.
Joel will also be taking skinning and the PHP-GTK to it's limit by
showing a new skeleton engine for building dynamic maps for games in
PHP-GTK using sprites.

Join Joel and New York PHP to see some exciting new code and techniques
with PHP-GTK.  Information on PHP-GTK isn't always easy to come by so
you won't want to miss this presentation and opportunity to speak with
Joel.  Platinum sponsor IBM has provided a great room with seating for
plenty.

APress and Sams have provided a great selection of books for meeting
attendees. Come prepared with a business card to enter the raffle.
