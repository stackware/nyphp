	Rapid AMP Certifications
Message-ID: <3F82118E.1050505@nyphp.org>


We've received numerous requests for providing additional resources to the community through online web forums, and have answered with http://forums.nyphp.org and forums at nyphp.org.

It's only recently rolled out, and we hope you will contribute by voicing what forums should be created and what topics they should cover.  Whether new user or PHP guru, with your feedback and participation we are building one of the most focused and useful technical discussion communities available on the Internet.  We are also considering hosting moderated forums and a community calendar, and would be happy for your participation in managing and organizing these forums.

Coupled with the already highly regarded mailing lists (http://nyphp.org/lists), both those who favor forums and lists will have a valuable resource. 

Please contact forums at nyphp.org and help shape what forums and subjects you'd find most useful.


---- Rapid AMP Certifications ----

Concise, intense, skill-centric; RAMP Certifications now available.

Thank You,

---- October Meeting Program ----

New York PHP has organized an exciting new lineup for our general
monthly meetings. Each meeting includes a monthly review of previous
PHundamental Threads, a technique, site or product demo, and a feature
presentation. We will be starting at 6:30pm sharp, so please arrive on
time.

October 28th, 2003 @ 6:30pm (sharp) at Digital Pulp, Inc.

      NYPHP developer Andrew Yochum follows last month's presentation
      on templates with the cutting edge solution, PHPTAL.

    * 7:00 Feature Presentation
      "PHP Image Functions"
      PHP is not limited to creating just HTML output. It can also be

      different image formats, including gif, png, jpg, wbmp, and xpm.
      For this month's presentation, NYPHP pixel jockey Jeff Knight
      will talk about using the GD library in PHP. Topics will include
      installation and configuration, a discussion of the image
      functions themselves, and related topics like goofy patent laws
      and basic color models and theory.
