<PRE>October General Meeting:
PHP Cloud Development with Kodingen
Scaling LAMP development with social coding, tools and cloud APIs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, October 26th, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/177">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/177</A> (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

Modern development can be scary. Keeping up with ominous cloud development,
social coding hugger-mugger, and a swarm of APIs, is enough to send a chill
down the spines of even killer developers - especially while under
decapitating deadlines and zombiesque requirement documents. But this
October NYPHP has the silver bullet as we welcome Kodingen  co-founder
Devrim Yasar. He'll walk us through the platform and offer the wooden spikes
you'll need to nail that next development project.

Simply put, Kodingen is a developer's friend. It gives you a free, social
hosting account with online code editing tools so you can code anywhere,
anytime, and together with whomever you want.

Kodingen.com is a free, cloud-based development environment that provides
developers with a feature-rich hosting platform, collaboration and social
coding tools, and integration with a wide variety of existing frameworks and
third party APIs. Kodingen is a revolution for developers by developers.

Kodingen allows anyone to set up their own free hosting environment on cloud
servers. Much of the traditional &quot;heavy lifting&quot; has been simplified into
point and-click operations. This has two benefits; first it saves time, and
second it makes the environment much more user friendly for hobbyists and
less sophisticated developers.

While traditional hosting services charge users per hosting account or for
additional services like SQL databases, everything on Kodingen is free for
developers. This includes cloud-based hosting, FTP file access, shell
access, 1-click framework installs (like Joomla or Wordpress), and a
plethora of social tools like Groups, Forums, and other user-to-user
communication.

We make hosting and social coding accessible to all. Not only are we free,
but our service and platform is stronger than most paid services. Our
revenue is generated through enterprise and high traffic accounts, allowing
us to keep the social coding cloud development environment free for
developers.

In this talk, Devrim will explain KFM - Kodingen's backend that includes:

 * How do we manage to serve +10k web sites from a single server
 * How do we execute 100k tasks an hour originating from these accounts
 * What exactly is Kodingen's backend and how does it work?

Kodingen's backend is called KFM and it is an application management system
running on a network of connected computer nodes. KFM dispatches application
execution requests to available node(s), starts application process,
monitors its execution status and restarts a process on the same or
different node(s) if required.

 * HTTP-based Task Management API interface with the following commands:
new, get status, put stdin, get stdout, get stderr, kill, wait.

 * Per-task high availability mode for long-running tasks. In this mode KFM
automatically restarts task process if it unexpectedly finishes and restarts
task process on different node if current task node goes down.

 * High availability of the system itself utilizing resource and data
redundancy.

 * System-independent protocols for network communication.

We'll walk you through the steps of how we convert UI actions into server
shell commands, and how we read the results and convert it back to UI
actions. You will see how we arbitrarily pick a server that has the less
load out of 1000 virtual machines, I will explain how we can auto scale from
one server to 10 thousand and go back to 10 servers without any human
interaction. I will also explain to you how we can achieve open-source
applications being deployed to &quot;Open-Clouds&quot; using KFM, with which hopefully
we can start dreaming about open-facebook or open-twitter kind of no-owner,
totally open-source apps living on their own in the clouds that nobody can
turn them off.
