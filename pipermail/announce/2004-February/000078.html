February Meeting Tonight
------------------------

When: February 24, 2004 at 6:30pm
Where: Digital Pulp
Details: <A HREF="../../../index.html">http://nyphp.org</A>

February's General Meeting continues the database thread started with
last month's PostgreSQL presentation by introducing PEAR DB.

PEAR DB is an object oriented API that provides common methods of
accessing thirteen of PHP's database driver extensions.

Daniel Convissor, NYPHP speaker and PEAR DB's current lead developer,
presents this month's meeting with highlights of the new version 1.6.0
release. The main points will be major bug fixes, API changes and new
portability features that make it possible to write programs that will
work with a wide variety of DBMS backends.

As always this meeting is free and open to the public - please be sure
to RSVP by sending a message to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/announce">rsvp at nyphp.org.</A>
