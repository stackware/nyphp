Message-ID: <086401cb37c1$96568720$c3039560$@com>

For all things phpBB, we welcome the Libertyvasion Conference to New York.
Stop by and we'll see you there.

The popular open-source phpBB forum software is holding its phpBB
Libertyvasion Conference on August 20th & 21st in the Times Square Area.
There are intentions to create phpBB 4 from scratch using the Symfony 2
Framework & Doctrine 2, so we split the event into a workshop day on Friday,
20th focusing on Symfony, Doctrine & Git and the main phpBB conference on
Saturdy, 21st with talks from key figures in the phpBB community.

The workshop day will start with introductory talks by our invited guests
Fabien Potencier (Symfony Lead Developer), Jonathan Wage (Doctrine & Symfony
Developer), Stefan Koopmanschap (Symfony Community Manager) and David Soria
Parra (Git, Mercurial & PHP Contributor). The afternoon can then be used to
work on individual projects with the help of the attending experts or simply
to discuss ideas with them.

Further information on the conference is available at:
http://www.phpbb.com/libertyvasion/

The full schedule for both days can be found at:
http://www.phpbb.com/libertyvasion/schedule

Tickets are only $100.00 for the workshop day and $20.00 for the conference
day. Please register in advance! You can also join us for the Social Event
on the evening of Saturday, 21st (no admission), but please make sure to
register in advance!

	Interfaces with PHP
Message-ID: <006a01cb3b0f$6d53fc80$47fbf580$@com>

August General Meeting:
Designing HTTP URLs and REST Interfaces with PHP
RESTful APIs with JSON, XML and HTTP
------------------------------------------------

         Date: MONDAY August 30th, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/175 (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

August in the city - what a glorious time. This August, we're pleased to
have special guest David Zuelke join us for a look at the vital techniques
and technologies involved in REST interfaces and APIs.

IMPORTANT: This month's meeting is not on Tuesday - it's Monday the 30th.
Normal RSVP procedures still apply.

A lot of Web Services today claim to be RESTful APIs. But are they really?
Do the URLs form a logical hierarchy, and do they accurately identify
resources? Are the powers of HTTP leveraged properly? What is "hypermedia",
and what is the secret behind the HATEOAS acronym that is so essential to
the REST architectural style? This talk gives answers and guidelines using
real-life examples.

David Zuelke is the lead developer of the Agavi project, an open source MVC
framework for PHP, and managing director at Bitextender GmbH, a Munich,
Germany based software company. He has been doing PHP development for more
than ten years and regularly speaks at conferences around the world.

August's NYPHP SIG meetup for Zend Framework
---------------------------------------------

Join us at TGI Friday's after the regular NYPHP User Group meeting for
August's Zend Framework Meetup/SIG.

Guest host Isaac Foster (http://www.linkedin.com/in/isaaczfoster) will lead
a discussion of how to use Doctrine with your Zend Framework applications.
Doctrine is not only a powerful object relational mapper (ORM) and database
abstraction layer (DBAL), but provides a framework for building your models
as well as some administrative tools that can reduce development time and
developer hair-pulling.  Doctrine integrates with ZF easily, so with a few
lines of code you'll be up and running in no time.

As always, feel free to bring your ZF questions for the group to discuss.

 Date: August 30, 2010 (a MONDAY)
 Time: Approx. 8 PM, after the regular NYPHP meeting
Place: TGI Friday's, 56 & Lexington, NYC
