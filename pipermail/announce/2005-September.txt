Subject: [nycphp-announce] joomla@nyphp: Supporting the former Mambo CMS;
	Sept. Training
Message-ID: <0MKoyl-1ECJQn25bF-0005hL@mrelay.perfora.net>


NYPHPers,

As many likely have heard, the Mambo CMS has undergone some fundamental changes.  In the past, New York PHP has supported this popular CMS by providing a dedicated virtual server and mailing lists for the community.

In light of the recent split, New York PHP has voted unanimously to back the new open source CMS, Joomla!  Joomla! is the new name of the Mambo CMS, and providing the same functionality and a true open source development model.

As a result, we've renamed our mailing list to the Joomla! SIG.

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla

The change is minor but an important step in showing support for an open source project that's truly open.

For more information on Joomla! and the changes surrounding this important CMS, see http://www.joomla.org



New York PHP Designer Track, September 19th - 20th

No programming background is expected as the Designer's Track helps experienced web designers learn to use the very popular language PHP to create interactive and database-driven websites.

	Last Change to Register, NYCBSDCon
Message-ID: <0MKoyl-1EDhNd0Qhs-0001UR@mrelay.perfora.net>


The heat has finally broken and it's now time to get back to work. With that, we're pleased to have Chris Shiflett, prolific author for O'Reilly, phpArchitect and PHP Magazine, presenting on the too often neglected topic of PHP Security.

Peer reviews are a frequently neglected asset of professional PHP development teams. With a moderate understanding of how to audit PHP code, you can vastly improve the security of your team's PHP applications.  This talk, by Chris Shiflett, explains the art of the PHP security audit. Using practical examples, you are shown how to search for common pitfalls, how to identify filtering and escaping errors, and how to report your findings.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP meetings are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

When: Tuesday, September 27th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)

Where: IBM  590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)

RSVP: RSVP Online, http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

IMPORTANT RSVP POLICY:
All attendees MUST RSVP within 30 days of this meeting and no later than 3:00pm the day before the meeting.
