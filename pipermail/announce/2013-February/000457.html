General Meeting
Secrets of mysqlnd
Inside the PHP native MySQL driver
----------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, February 26th, 2013 at 6:30pm (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/206">http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/206</A>
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

For years PHP and MySQL have helped raise the modern web, together
powering more sites than any other.  But with an alluring cloud and
seductive noSQL now on the scene, many see the relationship of these
long-time love birds as being on the rocks.

But this February matchmakers NYPHP and MySQL author and expert Ronald
Bradford are here to put that spark back and help work things out with
a look at MySQL's latest token of affection, mysqlnd - ensuring that
this romance novel, has a happy ending.

We all connect to MySQL in PHP using the various flavors of drivers,
including mysql and mysqli.  Available in PHP 5.3, the mysqlnd
replaces these under the covers and is the default in 5.4. The
standard functions to query, execute and retrieve remain, however a
whole new set of hidden features are now included with mysqlnd
extensions.  In this presentation we will discuss a few including:
- Read/Write splitting
- Load Balancing
- Master/Slave failover
- Persistent Connections
- Monitoring Techniques

Ronald Bradford has worked with relational databases for 24 years. His
first work with MySQL and PHP started in 1999. He is the author of 4
books on MySQL, including &quot;Expert PHP and MySQL&quot; and the Effective
MySQL series with books on SQL Optimization, Backup and Recovery and
Replication. He is a top MySQL blogger and the organizer of the
Effective MySQL New York users group.
