November General Meeting:
Zend/PHP Conference 2010 Recap
Highlights, discussion, and notables from the Zend PHP Conference
-----------------------------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, November 23rd, 2010 at 6:30PM (sharp)
     Location: Suspenders Restaurant, Private Room, 111 Broadway
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/179 (all attendees MUST RSVP)
 Post-Meeting: Suspenders

PHP is built to voyage to the uncharted territories of the Internet.  Yet
failure to correctly navigate the latest trends, techniques and talk, can
send development adrift with a wayward strategy and loss of direction.

This past month, NYPHP pioneers Alan Seiden and Neveo Harrison made the
westward pilgrimage to the <a href="http://zendcon.com/">Zend/PHP Conference
&amp; Expo</a>, an outpost on the frontier of internet development, bringing
back with them tales of untold fortune.

This November, NYPHP hosts an open discussion on what was discovered - and
undiscovered - with Alan and Neveo leading us through the unexplored worlds
of internet application development.

And for this, we give thanks.

IMPORTANT: This month's meeting is not at IBM.  Normal RSVP procedures still
apply.
