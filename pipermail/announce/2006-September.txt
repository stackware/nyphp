September General Meeting:
The CakePHP Framework
--------------------------

 When: Tuesday, September 26th at 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!

Fall is here and with it comes a look at another active PHP framework. With
feedback from the New York PHP Talk Mailing List, core developer Nate Abele
will be answering community questions at this September meeting. Join us as
we chew on MVC concepts and learn the CakePHP framework.

CakePHP is an MVC framework based on the principles of convention over
configuration and "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY).

Distributed under the MIT license, Cake is flexible not only in terms of IP
but also deployment: being compatible with PHP 4.3.2 and higher, Cake runs
out-of-the-box under most PHP installations/web servers, including Apache,
LightTPD, and IIS.

Cake sports "pretty" URL's with or without mod_rewrite (or equivalent), and
it's simple, array-based ActiveRecord enables easy implementation of complex
database logic.

Nate Abele has been a core developer of the CakePHP project for almost a
year and a half. He considers himself one of the few developers out there
who actually has the patience to deal with clients... sometimes. When not
coding, sleeping, or watching the Red Sox lose--again, Nate enjoys writing
about himself in the third person, snowboarding, and... well...
snowboarding.

Thanks to IBM for providing a great presentation space with seating for
plenty.

As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings are always
free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.
