September General Meeting:
WISP or Why a PHP Developer Should Care About Microsoft
-------------------------------------------------------

When: Tuesday, September 23rd, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

The crispness of Fall is here and NYPHP promises an equally refreshing
line-up as 2009 (where's my rocket car?) is on the horizon. We kick things
off in September with Microsoft Developer Evangelist Peter Laudati, and why
the WISP stack (Windows, IIS, SQL Server, PHP) could whisk you away with its
very own crisp clarity. And join us at TGI Fridays after the presentation
for complimentary drinks and hors d'oeuvres, thanks to Microsoft.

There are a host of technologies and tools from Microsoft that can add value
to your PHP solutions, save you time, and are just plain cool. This
presentation will cover server technologies like FastCGI, IIS and the PHP
SQL Server Driver, client technologies like the Microsoft AJAX Library and
Silverlight, as well as developer tools. This is not a sales pitch - it's a
technical walkthrough with demos, and will give you pointers to lots of
resources for digging deeper.

Peter Laudati is a Developer Evangelist with Microsoft. In his current role,
Peter works with the developer community in New York and New Jersey to
support area user groups, code camps, and other events. Previously, he
worked as a consultant in Microsoft's services division. As a consultant, he
worked on several application development projects and provided
architectural guidance for large customers throughout the NY & NJ metro
area. He lives with his family in central New Jersey and loves kayaking and
biking at the Jersey Shore.

Thank you to IBM for providing a great presentation space in Midtown
Manhattan. As a service to our community, New York PHP Community meetings
are always free and open to the public.

Come prepared with a business card to enter book raffles.

When: Tuesday, September 23rd, 6:30pm sharp (4th Tuesday of every month)
Where: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, Room 1219 (12th Floor)
 RSVP: http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

You must RSVP within 30 days of the meeting you attend!
