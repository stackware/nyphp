General Meeting
Responsive Web Design
Mobile-first design and layout with PHP and responsive HTML 5
-------------------------------------------------------------

         Date: Tuesday, January 22nd, 2013 at 6:30pm (sharp)
     Location: IBM, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, NY (12th Floor)
RSVP Required: http://www.nyphp.org/RSVP/205
 Post-Meeting: TGI Fridays at Lexington and 56th (about 8pm)

It's been twelve years since NYPHP started and a lot has changed since
then. Not only does Facebook rival TV as a primetime pastime - that's
right, a web site rivaling TV - it does so on dozens of screen sizes.
Whether smart, tablet, laptop or dull desktop, "cross-browser"
compatibility has taken on new meaning.

This January, we're pleased to have Sam Richard, Sr. Front End
Developer at NBCUniversal, kick off a new year with a look at the
latest in Responsive Web Design and development so that the next time
you're asked about mobile compatibility - you'll know how to respond.

Responsive Web Design is one of the largest shifts in thinking to hit
the web since tableless design and web standards. I'll be going over
the basics of responsive web design, including mobile first design,
grids, and breakpoints.

Sam Richard is a Sr. Front End Developer at NBCUniversal where he is
brining responsive web design and design in browser to big media.
Previously he has worked for the World Economic Forum and the New York
State Senate. Sam organizes the New York Responsive Web Design meetup
and co-organizes the Nee York Sass meetup. You can find him on the
Internet @Snugug or at http://snug.ug
