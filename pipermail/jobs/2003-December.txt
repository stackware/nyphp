Subject: [nycphp-jobs] PHP Tech Lead opportunity
Message-ID: <20031202160304.22051.qmail@web12104.mail.yahoo.com>

The following is a significant consulting opportunity for an individual consultant, which I briefly discussed with Hans at the last NYPHP meeting.  He mentioned that I should post the description to this mailing list.
 
IMPORTANT:  Please do not reply to this email address; the company's CTO is only reviewing resumes that are submitted to php_resumes at oddpost.com as described below.
 
Thanks in advance.
----------------------------------
 
An early stage funded startup seeks an individual consultant as the lead architect and developer for an open-source based web application that will serve as the core of the company's business.  The application will include significant commerce and order management functions and will be used both by consumers and business users across the internet.
 
The consultant must have demonstrated experience building scalable open source web applications (PHP/MySQL/Apache/Linux) including:
- building and managing development teams
- defining application architectures (incl underlying data models)
- leading development efforts
 
The Tech Lead will work directly with senior management (CEO and two technology executives) at the company to ensure overall application success and should thrive in a focused but entrepreneurial environment.
 
The iniital opportunity is for a 4-5 month full-time engagement beginning in January 2004.  Interested individuals should send their resume and cover letter (including that they heard about the opportunity via NYPHP) to php_resumes at oddpost.com.  The intent is to select a technical lead by mid-late December.

Message-ID: <006501c3bf5e$bf3fb400$0a0a0a0a@sinurealm>

 
Hi all,
 
Our main developers are going on well deserved vacations over the holidays.
We need 1-2 people to cover some project completion over this period.
These are paid on a project basis so the developers would need to be able to
quote projects in advance and understand that their bid will be looked at in
context of a handful of other developers and the developer with the best fit
will be awarded the project.
 
The work can be done remotely but occasional meetings at our South Bronx
office might be necessary.
 
We have a few small PHP projects that need to be completed in the next few
weeks.  You will be working with code that was started by someone else.
 
Anyone who is interested in working with us during this time -  please send
me your details, projects to look at and/or resumes.
 
There is a strong chance that we will use you for future projects based on
the results of these projects.
 
thanks,

| Larry Velez | http://sinu.com <http://sinu.com/>  |

management system for an employment agency to a knowledge base.

Perfect candidate should have plenty of php and db experience, be good with
app design and preferably have good presentation layer (html, dhtml, css,
javascript) skills as well.

Please email me a resume, links to a few sites you've worked on (along with

This is an ongoing freelance opportunity with a possibility of converting to
a staff position.

We needed help yesterday, so the sooner the better.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Possible Job Opening - part time
Message-ID: <3FDF8411.2010207@ydnt.com>

I do most of the web development and PHP stuff for this small company 
called Young Innovations, INC. (ydnt on the nyse) We are in the process 
of making a shopping cart for one of the small companies we own called 
plaksmacker. I have done all the work on this cart, it is the oscommerce 
cart that I'm sure lots of people are familiar with, but we have one 
problem with it:

it can only calculate shipping from one zip code location to another. 
Meaning that if we have 2 factories, which we do, the shopping cart will 
not know to calculate the shipping for the order based on which factory 
the customer is closest too.  OScommerce allows for shipping calculation 
from one location, a location that you setup early in the configuration 
part of the cart with a zip code. What we want the cart to be able to 
do, is to be able to determine the customers location from their signup, 
and assign them to a factory. When they place orders we would then like 
for the shipping module to calculate the shipping cost based on which 
factory they were assigned to, not just from the one location configured 
earlier in the cart.

There are some contributions that offer something simliar to this, but 
not exactly what we need, and I am unable to find any solution that I 
know of. So they told me to go out and try to find someone to come on 
part time to help us with this. This is why I'm posting here. If anybody 
thinks they know how to do it and would like to give me an estimate you 
can email me: ttoomey at ydnt.com with a resume, or even better a timetable 
for how long this would take I'd appreciate it.

-Tim

Hi,

 

I'm working with a not-for-profit that is contemplating a fairly large project with the development of a new software application as the glue holding together various parts.  I need to find someone who is fairly authoritative in (L)AMP data driven development to provide and put their name to a general estimate of feasibility, costs, and timelines.  

 
I can pay a whopping $50, so I figure this is an eyeball estimate.  I would, however, try to show appreciation by trying to involve the person or people in the project if it is a go.  Hence I hope for more thought then I have a right to request for the $50 fee.  Funding, by the way, would come from already targeted foundations and I think our name guarantees us a reasonable shot.

If interested, please send qualifications to ampcaht at yahoo.com. 

Regards.
