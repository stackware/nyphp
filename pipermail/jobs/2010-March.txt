I've got 10 years tech experience, 3 in web development and a computer
science degree from UC-Berkeley, plus, I'm a "borderline" genius.  Whatever
that means.  I'm smart enough to progam a computer.

Y'all know anyone who wants to hire me full-time and have their insurance
pay for my thoracic spinal surgery, wheelchair, etc that I've needed since
'79 from a gymnastics accident, but never diagnosed to me until 6 weeks ago.

Also, I'll be needing 4 months paid sick time the first year and 2 months
vacation and $150k/year (at least).

Apparently, getting a short term contract to pay my medical bills and credit
card debt is more difficult than I thought it would be.  And, everybody
wants to know the intricate details of my life, which I can't explain in 5
minutes and don't think is any of their business.  I've spend the better
part of the last 15 years bed-ridden or sitting in a chair, because laying
in bed gets old.

Finally, the job can not require any standing for meetings or otherwise.

But, I really don't think I can take another year of these herniated discs
pushing on my spinal cord right between my shoulder blades.

Any takers?

Dear Jane,

Like many on this list, I'm sorry to hear about your situation.

However, even the most promising candidates are having trouble finding
financially rewarding work in this economy. From where I'm sitting,
there is no shortage of qualified candidates offering to work for
below what's normally considered market rates.

Here's the April Fools part:
"Also, I'll be needing 4 months paid sick time the first year and 2
months vacation and $150k/year (at least.)"

You're asking for 150K for 6 months of work. That's a 300K salary,
plus anticipated downtime. Wow. I'm all for paying techies what
they're worth, and the best are worth a lot, but that's an April Fools
kind of starting salary. I'm sure most people on this list would be
very happy to start at 100K, or much less.

All the best,

Eliza Etzon

Yea seriously, I would be happy to have full time work that pays even
$40,000 a year. Try freelancing, living gig to gig, not knowing if you're
going to have work in the future. Health benefits? I haven?t been to the
doctor in over two years. For dinner today I had oriental ramen with ground
chicken.

Yeah, it was actually tongue in check.  I really want a short-term contract.
But, if you're willing to offer those outrageous terms you can get me
full-time.  :-)

That sucks.  You know you can by in though maybe the freelancer's union, if
your budget can allow?

Yeah, it was actually tongue in check.  I really want a short-term contract.
But, if you're willing to offer those outrageous terms you can get me
full-time.  :-)

There's a company that gives unlimited sick time to their employees.  I don't remember the name of the company, I saw it on the news.

But most companies have cut back since the recession.

Dear Jane,

Like many on this list, I'm sorry to hear about your situation.

However, even the most promising candidates are having trouble finding
financially rewarding work in this economy. From where I'm sitting,
there is no shortage of qualified candidates offering to work for
below what's normally considered market rates.

Here's the April Fools part:
"Also, I'll be needing 4 months paid sick time the first year and 2
months vacation and $150k/year (at least.)"

You're asking for 150K for 6 months of work. That's a 300K salary,
plus anticipated downtime. Wow. I'm all for paying techies what
they're worth, and the best are worth a lot, but that's an April Fools
kind of starting salary. I'm sure most people on this list would be
very happy to start at 100K, or much less.

All the best,

Eliza Etzon
