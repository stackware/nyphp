<PRE>This is a hybrid role and so offers a lot of opportunity for career
growth along multiple paths.  Below are the three components of the
roles--the weighting between them is flexible.  This job is ideal who
a programmer who likes system work or a sys admin looking to shift
more towards programming.  It absolutely offers a lot of variety.



Job Description:

Sys Admin
We run managed servers (CentOS) but there are overall system
architecture and maintenance issues.  We send millions of emails a
month to our customers (opt-in, nothing sketchy here) and run some
large email systems.  There are also a number of tools we either use
in-house or with whom we integrate (from nagios and continuous
integration servers to 24/7's OAS).

MySQL DBA
We have some sizable, replicated MySQL servers (InnoDB).  We need at
least three 9's uptime and ideally four.  You should understand
installation, monitoring, performance turning, replication, and backup
and recovery schemes.

Coder
Our systems are stable and a good admin like yourself can keep things
humming with minimal effort.  The above two roles will probably take
up 40-60% of the time. We do a lot of PHP coding and would like
someone who can contribute to the code base as an active developer on
the team. We also use a number of scripts to keep everything wired
together which you would likely own.



Requirements
* Significant experience with *nix system administration (ideally
CentOS or similar)
* Significant experience with large, replicated MySQL databases
needing 24/7 uptime
* Experience with large volume email servers and email list management
* Unix shell scripting experience
* Experience with standard web hardware--firewalls, load balances, etc.
* Experience with PHP
* Strong communication skills
* Fun attitude, well liked by co-workers (don't underestimate how is
important this one is!)

Nice to haves...
* Experience with scrum or other agile methodologies a plus
* Well traveled passport is a big plus



About the company:
We are a small, profitable travel media company located in midtown
Manhattan.  We have all the upside of a startup (casual environment,
agile methodology, rapid launching of new web and mobile products)
combined with the advantages of an established company (profitable,
good brand name, an existing user base to quickly adopt new products).

Every single person in engineering is expected to be a leader.  If you
want to be told what to do and code quietly in the corner, we're not
the place for you.  Rather we want engineers who say &quot;I've got an
idea...&quot; and will see that idea from thought through roll-out.
Engineers are expected to keep abreast of new technologies and use
them to develop new products.

Our industry is travel and our employees travel the world, so if you
like traveling you'll enjoy the perks of being an insider.
