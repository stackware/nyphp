<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Join one of the top online travel media companies and lead us forth
into new products and technologies!  We're looking for PHP ninjas /
rock stars / pirates / gurus / &lt;insert term-du-jour here&gt; to help lead
our agile team. &#160;We have a number of new products and services rolling
out in 2011 and want you to help us lead them.

(Like non-web platforms? While we're primarily web we're launching on
the ipad and will be doing other mobile apps as well.)

We have multiple roles open including Architect, Tech Lead, Sr
Developer, Front End Developer, and more.  The follow is a generic
description, specific responsibility and requirements will vary by
particular role (but you already know the difference in jobs
descriptions between say an architect and a front end developer
anyway).


Responsibilities
* Lead design and development of different product lines
* Develop and maintain (well tested, well documented) code
* Lead and mentor more junior developers
* Keep on top of new technologies and help discover technology based
business opportunities on the web, phones, ipad, and other platforms


Requirements:
* Significant experience coding PHP / LAMP
* Strong communication skills
* Comfort with *nix environments
* Experience with MySQL
* Experience mentoring
* Fun attitude, well liked by co-workers (don't underestimate how is
important this one is!)

Nice to haves...
* Good leadership abilities a plus
* Strong MySQL skills a big plus
* CakePHP and other framework experience a plus
* Experience with other languages (RoR, Java, Python) a plus
* Experience with scrum or other agile methodologies a plus
* Well traveled passport is a big plus


About the company:
We are a small, profitable travel media company located in midtown
Manhattan. &#160;We have all the upside of a startup (casual environment,
agile methodology, rapid launching of new web and mobile products)
combined with the advantages of an established company (profitable,
good brand name, an existing user base to quickly adopt new products).

Every single person in engineering is expected to be a leader. &#160;If you
want to be told what to do and code quietly in the corner, we're not
the place for you. &#160;Rather we want engineers who say &quot;I've got an
idea...&quot; and will see that idea from thought through roll-out.
Engineers are expected to keep abreast of new technologies and use
them to develop new products.

Our industry is travel and our employees travel the world, so if you
like traveling you'll enjoy the perks of being an insider.
