Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Seeking Expert PHP Developers for OmniTI's NY Office
Message-ID: <46929AF4.3080104@php.net>

OmniTI is opening a NY office, and we need some good PHP developers.

About OmniTI

We're a consulting company that gets to work on some of the most
interesting web sites around. Our marketing-speak for this is that our
client list looks like a who's who of Internet destinations, and that's
a pretty accurate description.

Our staff consists of a wide variety of open source contributors,
authors, and speakers. Among us, we have written nearly a dozen books,
given hundreds of conference talks (we're giving a dozen at OSCON this
month), and developed tools like APC, APD, and PDO. We also boast core
developers from open source projects such as PHP and PostgreSQL.

We're passionate about what we do, and we love working together.

About You

You know PHP intimately and can frequently be found answering questions
on mailing lists. You are smart, friendly, and humble. Most importantly,
you have a good sense of humor and work well in a collegiate
environment. (You love sharing what you've learned as much as you love
learning from others.)

You're not easily overwhelmed by difficult problems and can methodically
discover the root-cause. However, your pride never prevents you from
seeking help when appropriate. (Our strength as a company is the fact
that we don't work in isolation.)

You truly have great potential and are searching for a career that can
help you reach it.

About This Job

We're aggressively growing our web development and web application
security practices, and PHP is a leading technology in both industries.
As part of our NY team, you have the opportunity to be a part of any
number of related responsibilities, including architecting and
developing web sites, penetration testing and code auditing, developing
security-related tools, and engaging in research to help advance the web
application security practice within OmniTI as well as the industry as a
whole.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, please contact me:

Thanks for reading.

Message-ID: <200765.72698.qm@web52304.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

To whom it may concern:

I am an experienced PHP developer looking for engaging, full-time
position. I am interested in software development and enjoy an environment
which allows me to produce easy-to-use interfaces with clean,
maintainable, extensible code geared toward efficiency. I enjoy the
challenge of maintaining code and migrating functionality into PHP 5 as
well as designing or developing new applications. Please see a sample of
my work and my resume at: 
http://206.251.255.73:8080/

I have over 5 years of professional experience as a PHP developer which
includes experience as a project lead, project manager, and IT manager. I
have written code for projects ranging from enterprise eCommerce websites,
business application solutions, and in-house content management systems.
Although I program in OO PHP 5, I am comfortable with most procedural or
object oriented languages and have experience with PHP 4, Java,
JavaScript, C, C++, Python, Perl and shell scripting. I currently develop
in a MAMP (or LAMP) environment and upload to a security hardened OpenBSD
server; but, most of my development has been done in Linux/Unix. In
addition to Apache, I have developed websites using IIS on a Windows
server and lighttpd on RedHat. I have experience with a number of
relational database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL,
and Oracle. As a project lead and manager, I have designed software and
configured clean development environments using versioning software such
as CVS or Mercurial and multi-stage development practices. Also, I have
web-related system administrator experience for the platforms above.
Finally, I am knowledgeable in most LAMP-related technologies including
XML, XSL, XSLT, XHTML, DHTML, CSS, and AJAX.

Please feel free to contact me via email at j.andrew.mcentire at gmail.com if
you have a position for which I would be a good fit.

Jeremy
