<PRE>Hi, I'm working on bringing an idea for a fashion oriented start-up to life
and given my advertising, marketing and strategy background I've been more
than able to put together a business and marketing plan, stages of
continuous innovation, and numerous revenue streams for this idea, all of
which have generated interest and even helped me get some experienced
informal advisers but....

I NEED A TECH LEAD.

All the people I know who know tech people are out on the West Coast and
I've had little to no luck finding someone out here. I want to find someone,
ideally a long-term partner, that can work with me on my idea and help take
it from my head and the paper into lovely code and make the site and mobile
app a reality. As far as compensation and financial reward, I am very open
and flexible to discussing whatever might make this work. I have friends and
family who are willing to invest in helping bring this life, and I also have
several friends in the VC world who would be willing to assist in taking
this to a bigger scale once we actually make this happen.

Anyhow, guess that's about it and really looking forward to hearing back.

Thanks,

Emeka
