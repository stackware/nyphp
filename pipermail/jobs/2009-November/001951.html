<PRE>AppNexus is looking to expand our engineering team and if you are  
interested in joining us, we want to talk to you. Our team is made up  
of innovators and industry veterans building the next generation  
online advertising ecosystem. Our goal is to build a platform to make  
online display advertising more efficient, transparent, and effective.  
If we succeed in our mission, we will unlock millions - if not  
billions - of dollars of incremental revenue for publishers and  
advertisers, which will fuel the next phase of Internet innovation.

You will be working alongside experienced, Zend Certified Engineers  
that will help you grow as a developer just as much as we will learn  
from you.

Contact me if interested - I would love to hear from you!

Position Description

We are looking for a front end engineer with solid JavaScript, object- 
oriented PHP5, and MySQL experience to become a core member of a  
sharp, dynamic team. AppNexus clients trade on a steady stream of  
online media through our real-time transactional platform, a  
distributed system built on top of the AppNexus computing cloud that  
responds in a few milliseconds to billions of requests each day &#8212;  
24/7, 365 days a year.

We need an efficient and agile engineer motivated by solving  
interesting technical challenges and building new applications  
quickly. Our team is rapidly developing new interfaces, functionality,  
and tools for our platform, and finding innovative ways to visualize  
lots of analytics data.

The position requires a problem solving mindset as much as it requires  
strong JS and PHP development skills. The ideal candidate is hands-on  
when designing applications and is comfortable coding off of a problem  
statement instead of a formal spec. Our environment is open,  
collaborative, and encourages learning. We release new code at least  
once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases reliability),  
so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and confident in  
your work. You&#8217;ll immediately see the results of your work and  
creativity &#8212; as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world  
at large.

Requirements

     * 2-5 years of production software development experience
     * Proficiency in Object Oriented PHP 5, experience with Zend  
framework preferred
     * Advanced JavaScript, AJAX, HTML and CSS usage a must,  
experience with jQuery preferred
     * Experience with both developing in a LAMP environment and basic  
LAMP system administration
     * Experience with server side application development and web  
services
     * Experience with a version control system and writing unit tests  
within a testing framework
     * Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24/7 environment

This position is full-time in New York City (Union Square). This is  
not a telecommute or contract role. Unfortunately Relocation  
Assistance and Visa Sponsorships are not available at this time. No  
third-party subcontractors or agencies.
