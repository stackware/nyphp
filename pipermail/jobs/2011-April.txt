PHP OPTIMIZATION - SHORT TERM CONTRACT



I am looking for someone highly experienced in PHP, MySql, Ajax and Java
Script to complete some optimization on a web scraping application.

Experience in using the PCNTL_FORK function (or similar) for multi-threaded
web scraping as well as experience optimizing scraping cron jobs for speed
would be a plus.



I expect the contract to last for 1 ? 2 weeks with the opportunity for
continued work.



The role would be in New York  and require working from home with update
meetings in Manhattan. Speed and communication skills are a must.



If interested please email: icemead at gmail.com

Hello,

My name is Matt Kaufman and I have lived and been active in the New York
City area since 2005.  For the past 3 years I have worked on research
deepening and strengthening my development and system skills in the area of
PHP, packet-level protocol work, MySQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, (and other DB's),
Linux, DNS, Mail, Squid, ICAP (Greasyspoon), RabbitMQ, Solr/Sphinx, and a
multitude of too many other protocols, services and packages to list out
right now.  With the point being, if you have a specialty technology,
framework or detail to your project or work that you require; especially in
the specialty skill-set requirement specific, please ask me as I am maybe
the guy that can complete your job or task or give the correct input.

I am looking for fast-fill contract and or freelance development projects in
LAMP and the sorts..... That can hold my stay off here in New York up until
the point that I find and place myself in a permanent employment with a
company deserving it here in the city.

I value input, feedback and response from all; including potential permanent
employers, as well as anybody requiring contract or freelance development.

Message-ID: <6DF4FD13D11B604992E2AF9DC63286DB0D4B1187@EXCH10.TTS.local>

Hi,

I am hoping you could help me with a programmer need.  The position is with a major agency in New York City and the requirements description is:

LAMP Developer
Advanced PHP
Advanced MySQL
Advanced SVN and/or Git, including installation
Comfortable configuring server applications such as Apache, PHP, MySQL, FTP, Postfix, etc.
Comfortable administering users and file access / permissions on Red Hat
Comfortable setting-up rewrite rules for clean URLs
Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javscript (specifically jQuery)

You will be joining a staff Front-End Developer. There are two big projects under development that need support. The first is an internal time tracking tool. Quite a bit of work has been done already. We want to bring someone on who is great with PHP and handwritten MySQL queries to finish writing "the brains" of the application so our Front End guy can skin it.

The second project that is just kicking off is our new website. All of the creative is done, and the HTML pages have begun to be laid-out. We are looking to bring on a heavy-hitting LAMP person right at the beginning. You will be tasked with: configuring the Apache server, setting-up the MySQL database, installing version control (SVN or Git), installing Wordpress, setting-up Rewrite rules, recommending a solution for the "Work" and "People" pages (possible custom CMS development), any necessary back-end development.

Length of time would be about 4 weeks. Location is NYC. Must be on-site.

Please let me know if you have any questions,

Message-ID: <BANLkTinac7Rf_u+B6cQdqGY02wLfkvcpVA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm not a recruiter. Recruiters are lame and have no idea what they're
doing. I know exactly what I'm looking for, so I'm posting here.

---

Let's start with the boring stuff up front: We're a small, agile,
well-trafficked startup in the sports analytics space. We've been covered by
TechCrunch, we've been written up in Sports Illustrated, and now we're going
to revolutionize the way users consume and engage with sports content. Our
founders are ballers, our advisors are even more ballerous, and just wait
until you see our product..

If you're someone who loves sports and also loves building products, then
we're your company. Even if you're not a huge sports fan, feel free to reach
out to us - we're more interested in someone who knows how to get stuff
done. If you're wondering what kind of people we're like socially, we have a
kegerator in our office and our most played artist on iTunes is Animal
Collective. You should be able to get our jokes and we should be able to
want to hang out with you outside of work.

Our stack is built on PHP and MySQL, but we're considering moving to Couch
or Mongo. What do you suggest? We'd love to know. We have a world-class
designer and front-end developer on board, we need to find someone who is
comfortable on the PHP backend, taking things from the browser-level all the
way down to the DB. We're not looking for someone who is merely good; we're
looking for *great* - '85 Bears great. Lemieux in the 91-92 playoffs great.
Lemonade and BBQ on a Summer afternoon great.
*
Skillsets:*

   - Excellent PHP skills (should be comfortable building out an application
   scalable to 100,000 daily uniques)
   - Knowledgeable of system-wide architecture (setting up version control,
   release engineering structs, etc.)
   - Comfortable working in a fast-paced startup setting
   - Familiarity with beer pong and general precepts of social skill



*Nice to have:*

   - Familiarity with HTML/CSS/jQuery (not totally necessary as we already
   have a world-class designer and front-end)
   - Sports fan (big, big plus - let us know what your favorite team is)



*What we're not:
*

   - Some huge, boring company where you'll have meetings about meetings
   - A company that works in a space that you could care less about
   - A startup that values founder's valuations over the future gains of the
   employees
   - A company founded by a bunch of suits who can't code Hello World in
   BASIC


*Even though we're a startup, this is a salary position.* We'll shell out
for the right employee. There is also a *TON* of equity involved; you're the
third employee and huge part of our future success - we'll take care of you.
You should ideally be in NYC, but that won't stop us from moving forward
with the right person.

To apply, just send us a resume (please send nik at numberfire.com) and we'll
go from there.

These are the sorts of job posts that just  make me look forward to

I should want to hang out with you outside of work and watch you drink

Clearly nobody in this awesome company has yet seen their 25th birthday...

Plus, if you can remember how to do "Hello world!" in BASIC without
googling it (print? echo? quotes? semicolon?), then, you have a great
memory. Good for you. I would hardly consider any knowledge of BASIC
to be credential in the year 2011. Good luck, bros...

Kristina,

In their defense, this kind of agile, work hard, play hard environment is 
becoming much more common.  One of the largest start-ups I know gladly 
gives free alcohol to their employees, and yes, they drink during the day. 
But no is irresponsible, and it's been rated one of the top companies to 
work for.  Like Nik's company (I assume), they are looking for top talent 
and wouldn't hire people who are likely to abuse the system.  My guess is 
(though I don't know Nik) that his company also has an extremely relaxed 
vacation policy, because it isn't about the time you take, it's about the 
work you accomplish.

Startups thrive on employees that share a common ideal and culture. We're a
sports startup; we expect our employees to enjoy sports, enjoy hanging out
with each other, and enjoy the common experience of building a company from
a ground up. Therefore, we overwhelmingly prefer someone who will fit in
well with us. A good place to start from on that whole "fitting in" mantra
is not making outrageously incorrect generalizations.

It's not for everyone and it's apparently not for you. Thank you for your
concern.

...yep.

Culture is everything when building a team. If you can't create a culture
that makes people love working for you, you'll never survive. I'm not
interested in creating a culture that works for everyone, I'm interested in
creating a culture that works specifically for the key people I need. It's
not a job for everyone, and I'll never describe it as such.

It may be becoming more common, but it's a total turnoff to most 
people.  It doesn't seem like good business to limit oneself to hiring 
those under 25 and/or those with alcohol abuse problems, especially for 
a CTO position...?   You're automatically excluding the best talent from 
the search from the get-go, and attracting the sort of employee who 
won't be able to do the work properly, thereby resulting in a poor product.

There's no way a job post like that can yield any "top talent".

Kristina,

You and I are almost always on the same page, but here I have to disagree 
with you.

Please read this article:

http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/13420/Startup-Culture-Lessons-From-Mad-Men.aspx

I assure you... that company has some of the best talent working for it in 
the area.

-Matt

I don't want to put words in anybody's mouth here, but I think that
the point is that the original post was one of the most laughably
douchey posts this list has seen in a long time. What's wrong with
having a little fun with it? Sham'on 'nah, people!

This trend to reply to job postings keeps popping up roughly once a year,
and it's really getting annoying.  The whole basis for this complaint is
that you don't like their culture or how they're choosing to advertise to
their prospective talent.

In addition, you've somehow jumped to the conclusion that anyone who is
interested in this would have to be under 25; I don't see anywhere on the
jobs mailing list that job postings need to be geared towards people over
25.  Guess what? I'm 24, and I happen to like seeing job postings on this
list.  In addition, you've also assumed that if I happen to be intrigued by
their job posting or should happen to want to work there, I have an 'alcohol
abuse problem' and that I wouldn't be top talent.  There are no basis for
these claims.  If you don't like the job postings that are coming to the
list, just unsubscribe.

I'm not subscribed to this list to see "witty" comments from people who are
going to make bold claims about people and environments they're not a part
of.

Hi Joseph,

I'm not sure how you find Nik's post to be what you describe.  I thought 
the post was quite original, and he sells his start-up quite well (to the 
type of person he's looking for, of course).

Hear hear Brian! Whatever people might think of the company, their culture,
or whatever it is they're more than entitled to their opinion, but no need
to put them on blast, break them down, and criticize the character of their
current or future team members. It's a lovely day out and we should be
thankful that unlike in real life if you see something on here that you
disagree with or is ruining your day you can simply delete it! That being
said, let's keep it positive and supportive and stick to the purpose of
posts on this list, jobs, not hating!

Any article that references a TV show doesn't have much credibility in 
my book, I'm sorry to say.  And the ideas here are absurd.

As long as this company truly doesn't mind limiting their talent pool to 
inexperienced kids who enjoy working in a loud frat house alongside 
drunken morons who get nothing done although they are there 14 hours a 
day, and probably have deplorable personal hygiene to boot, and they 
truly feel that a person such as this can build quality software, they 
should be fine with a job post like this.

However I am very, very glad that I'm not an investor in this company, 
because this business plan is a recipe for disaster.    Speaking as 
someone who's old enough to be their mother, 25 year old kids THINK they 
have all the answers and us old folks know nothing.  They want to do 
everything differently than we did.

But usually things soon go horribly awry and someone has to clean up the 
mess...usually, one of us old fogies.

Matt, send in your resume now -- free BEER!  Wooooooooo.   It's not a 
job, it's a party!

Good news! You've succeeded to be more annoying than before, by continually hitting "reply all".

With what little due respect I have left for you at this point, can you please just e-mail those folks directly, going forward?

Subject: Re: [nycphp-jobs] CTO/Lead Engineer Opportunity

Any article that references a TV show doesn't have much credibility in
my book, I'm sorry to say. And the ideas here are absurd.

As long as this company truly doesn't mind limiting their talent pool to
inexperienced kids who enjoy working in a loud frat house alongside
drunken morons who get nothing done although they are there 14 hours a
day, and probably have deplorable personal hygiene to boot, and they
truly feel that a person such as this can build quality software, they
should be fine with a job post like this.

However I am very, very glad that I'm not an investor in this company,
because this business plan is a recipe for disaster. Speaking as
someone who's old enough to be their mother, 25 year old kids THINK they
have all the answers and us old folks know nothing. They want to do
everything differently than we did.

But usually things soon go horribly awry and someone has to clean up the
mess...usually, one of us old fogies.

Matt, send in your resume now -- free BEER! Wooooooooo. It's not a
job, it's a party!

I'm not sure what else to say.  I've presented the facts, and you seem to 
have little experience in this type of environment to be making such bold 
statements.  To avoid us continuing to spam a job list which is meant for 
job postings only, we can just respectfully agree to disagree.

Matt -- I actually DO have experience working in this type of 
environment (because the kids they had there couldn't get the job done) 
and all I have to say is NEVER, EVER AGAIN!
PS Hans has said that it's OK for us to, within reason, post about our 
opinions of job posts here, unless the policy has changed, so it's not 
spam, but I am done now don't  worry :)

As a "lame recruiter" let me remind you that U.S. Labor Law (State and
Federal) is very clear on the mention or implied metion of alcohol,
tobacco and other narcotics in job postings and job incentives. It is
not only prohibited, it also falls under discrimination of the equal
employment act (Title VII, the ADA) - this is not limited to job
advertisements; recruitment; testing; use of company facilities; et
al.  I urge you to be careful when posting mention of this - all it
takes is one complaint.

 You know I usually try to just ignore you Kristina,

But you're once again (I think your sophomoric statements about
Coldfusion was the last cause for me to pipe-up) creating an atmosphere
to this list that I find "a total turnoff", and a sad reflection of your
character.

The reason this list exists is for those with professional PHP skills to
have an easily accessible stream of available positions.  If a poster
posts positions that are most surely PHP intensive, and if they do so
with a passion as to attract a particular type of candidate, it is
completely within the scope of this list. 

I'd rather have more posts of that than "Python programmer needed... who
may have seen the letters 'P','H' and 'P' coupled together in a sentence
at some point in time" type posts.

Your hateful, insulting and just plain liable (The poster never
mentioned age requirements) comments are in no way, shape or form
helping people using this list, nor fairly representing the intelligent
and professional subscription base.  If you have criticisms to offer of
the poster, having perhaps first-hand experience that an
environment/position is not as it is being portrayed, then by all means
share; but to just take the opportunity to lash-out at a post that you
feel doesn't cater particularly to you and your employment needs is
immature and ultimately poorly reflective of the professionals on this list.

Mr Bonaddio I apologize on behalf of the list for Kristina's lack of
wisdom in responding to your post, and I appreciate you taking the time
and interest to post to our list, and to seek to describe the
environment of your organization clearly.  There are certainly members
of this list that would find your available position intriguing, and
there are others that may be very uninterested; alas, this is always the
case in any industry, but your attempt to be up-front about the
atmosphere I commend and appreciate.

Thanks,
Ed

As a self employed person, I'm certainly wasting time on these posts, 
but it's my luxury to do so, isn't it, so please, everyone, forgive me 
for the audacity of having an opinion.  We now return to our regular 
programming.

[Also, I'm in no way discouraging any startup companies from posting 
here as I'm sure they give less than a whit about what some old lady 
programmer says, and will continue to post these jobs with regularity.
Guys, your free beer is safe.  No worries.]

Cheers!

K

Guys,

I think you're being rude with the original poster.
He is just selling his fish, like you do almost daily on this list.

I never directly spoke with Kristina, neither I live in US (I'm
actually from Brazil), but I found her first email very aggressive and
rude.

I think the guy was trying to say he wants someone to be a CTO that
has "Open Team" in mind.
What I said here is something that I would love to see in whatever
company I'd work for. This talk from Cal Evans illustrates a lot what
employees expect from their bosses:

http://blog.calevans.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Open-Teams1.pdf

Maybe the guy used wrong words (I love to drink a beer at work, but
it's also prohibited in Brazil - I just think it shouldn't be
mentioned on job posting), but it's his way to do so. It's the same
thing if any of you misspell something - as I probably did -, and in
20min appears tons of emails making fun of it.

I expect more maturity not only on job postings, but also from anyone
that follows this list.

This list is for everyone interested in job postings.
If you think this one is not good or the guy should have said
something different/better, privately give him the tips. =)

I certainly found the post to be quite original. Nik's just being upfront
about the type of person they are looking for. In a start up, culture is as
important as talent.

BTW, I work with Ni. He has never showed up to work drunk and has never
passed out from excessive drinking. And yes, he's older than 25.

Cheers!

Hi All,

Thanks, but this discussion isn't in the spirit of the list, ie jobs 
offered or sought. It'd be a shame to scare of future posters that may 
have the right job for *you*. In the meantime, let's not be rude to the 
guys who have the right job for someone else.

Please take further discussion offline or into a different forum. The 
talk list may be a more appropriate place.

Regards,
Andrew
