<PRE>Junior/Mid Web Developer for *Full Time* onsite hire (Chelsea)

** No headhunters, freelance or offshore please!**

We value creative, independent people who love programming and enjoy a stable, energetic work environment.

Unlike many shops, we are not looking for not just a code monkey, but a professional programmer interested in expanding not only their programming skills, but also the skills necessary for a successful career in client facing programming (as opposed to just sitting in a dungeon doing back end work). That is very important to stress: this is a client facing position, so enjoying that aspect of the job is a necessity.

Our clients projects range from the occasional WordPress site to high profile, large scale CMS and E-Comms; we work with creative agencies to deliver technical and business consulting, as well as deliver the technology required for that particular project; we host a number of our client projects as well and assist in the configuration and maintenance of client hosting environments.

A sample of how our varied project types run:
- Blank Sheet Project (discovery/documentation/design/db &amp; application build/qa/launch) 
- Maintenance Project - pre-existing sites (either our projects or inherited projects) 
- Add/Modify large sets of features to existing project

All of these require interacting with the project producer and the client in order to scope the project, estimate time, decide on the technology to be used, etc. Staffed entirely by experienced web producers and developers, every project is a collaboration! 

You will work with seasoned developers, but should have 1-2 years of the following skills:

- Excellent written and verbal communication skills 
- Business problem analysis and solving skills, as well as basic documentation 
- Project estimating and planning 
- MySQL/ MSSQL Database architecture (planning, creating and maintaining) 
- PHP &amp; Programming methodologies/frameworks/Installations (Zend, etc.) - Certifications a plus!
- Front End HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery/Sencha 
- Code documentation 
- PSD/Graphics Slicing 

Team skills required:
- You can work very independantly and enjoy problem solving
- You know when to stop solving it yourself and ask your team for help
- Work in a very horizontal, stand-on-your-own-two-feet environment 
- Carve pumpkins and bowl! 
- Everyone takes out the garbage (but no one does windows) 

Bonus skills include:
- Drupal
- ColdFusion 
- Basic design skills 
- Python/Ruby/Perl/Etc. 
- HTML5 or CSS3 
- LAMP/WAMP Server config &amp; management 
- iOS/Android Development 
- C/.NET/Other programming 
- Other programming interests (robotics, etc.)

We offer: 
- 401K 
- Medical 
- Generous Sick/Vacation/Personal
- TransitCheck

Where: 
A block away from Penn station, big windows, no cubicles.

Please read these requirements simple carefully:

1. Email a cover letter as an email that includes your availability (for interviews and starting work, in general). The subject line must read &quot;Web Developer - [Your First and Last Name]&quot;
2. Your Resume/CV, attached, with references and URLs.


**We are EOE** **You must be able to work legally in the USA***
