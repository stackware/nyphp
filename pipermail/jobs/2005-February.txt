implement requirements in a clean, elegant way. Reusable code is
important, using object-oriented design where possible. Functional tests
will be written, where possible, to validate the correctness of the
code.

Candidates should be able to provide examples of web applications and/or
frameworks that they have developed, to discuss practical and
theoretical consequences of design choices. 


Qualifications:


*  Professional experience developing/architecting PHP-based web
applications 

*  SQL and a good knowledge of client-server architecture a must 

*  Web page design with HTML, JavaScript?, and CSS
