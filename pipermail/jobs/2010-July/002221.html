<PRE>This is not a development job, this is an online-marketing job working 
with a PHP- and Drupal-based financial information business.  Many of 
the regular readers of this list will know individuals with the right 
experience for this position.  We are seeking a Subscriptions Marketing 
Manager to continue the growth of our successful subscription business.  
This position is 80% online marketing, with some product management and 
product development mixed in, and the opportunity to collaborate with 
our outbound sales team.  This is a full-time position in our Jersey 
City, New Jersey office.

Qualifications

You have previous experience with subscription businesses, preferably 
related to financial services or business information, and with a strong 
online component.  You have a track record of growing subscriptions 
through cost-effective consumer online direct marketing, affiliate 
marketing, search marketing, and related channels.  You are web-savvy 
and knowledgeable about financial markets, especially US equities.  You 
are prepared for a dynamic work environment.  You should have a college 
degree and significant previous work experience, strong communications 
skills, and excellent project management discipline.

Responsibilities

You will oversee a portfolio of subscription products which will grow 
over time.  Your success will come from the success of those products: 
how well they attract trials, convert trials to paying subscriptions, 
and retain subscribers over time.  You will work closely with product 
development and sales to assure that these products continue to meet 
customer needs, operate reliably, and get periodic feature upgrades to 
remain cutting-edge.

This job is not suitable for telecommuting or work-from-home 
arrangements, part-time employment or contractors.  You should be 
authorized to work full-time in the U.S. for any employer, we are not 
sponsoring applicants for this position.  This is a full-time salaried 
position with competitive compensation including health benefits and 
paid vacation.

For immediate consideration, reply with your resume, cover letter and 
salary history.  Please, no recruiters.

The Connors Group, Inc. (<A HREF="http://www.cg3.com">http://www.cg3.com</A>) is proud to be an 
equal-opportunity employer.
