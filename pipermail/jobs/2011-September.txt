	the PHP & MongoDB Communities
Message-ID: <CAPiCn7psHtsyHAk4haoHo069-cDtug=-FXiHkSrt+avvjt6NFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

10gen develops and supports MongoDB, an open source, non-relational
database. We are hiring Language Evangelists to work with the PHP
community. The evangelists are responsible for not only working on the
MongoDB PHP driver but for being the liaison to the PHP community.

We expect evangelists to work on open source software as part of their
day-to-day activities. On one day, it might be building a cool sample
application to be used as an example in our docs, in a blog post, or
in a presentation. On another day, it might be working with existing
libraries and frameworks and integrating them with MongoDB. On yet
another, evangelists work on the MongoDB language driver itself.

The evangelists spend much of their time interacting with other
developers in the MongoDB community. We expect evangelists to be
engaged with their language community at conferences and meetups
around the world. Evangelists also help our customers and users when
they require support.

This is an amazing opportunity for someone who likes variety in their
work, wants to get paid to work on open source software, and values
community engagement. If this describes you, please check out this
link for more details: http://jobvite.com/m?3e5Q9fw2

We are also hiring Java, Ruby, Python, and Perl evangelists. Please
get in touch with me if you want to learn more about these positions
or life at 10gen.

Thanks,
Meghan

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Integrate Amazon Checkout with Custom PHP Cart
Message-ID: <8C3F71D6-4607-406C-8F6C-6E970CED65A4@studio23.com>

I have a client that needs to integrate their custom php shopping cart with Amazon inline checkout. Does anyone have experience with something like this?

A developer created a shopping cart system but the client wants to move to Amazon's inline checkout system. Amazon's code generator streamlines the process of what Amazon needs to display its widgets but but I need someone to help integrate address calls and such with the client's tax and shipping tables before sending the order back to Amazon for processing.

Interested, email Lee Willett at lee at studio23.com
