Message-ID: <4F820FB0.9040501@gmail.com>

Hey all,

I have a potential client with a potential need for potential software. 
Have I conveyed that this is not firm at all yet?  :)

The client needs to decide on COTS or built up reporting tools and that 
decision will drive a lot of the next choices. Their goals are 
incremental growth from one section outwards until they have end to end 
capabilities that tie together. They are also not a software house and 
I'm proposing to act as the Project Manager for them and potentially 
grow their business.

What I'd like to do is get some ideas from you about what you'd need to 
know to be interested in a project, and what the range of $/hr might be 
when you can work your own schedule in your own jammies. I would want 
daily version control check-ins as the client has had difficulties with 
that before. The goal would be small starts, incremental builds, and 
frequent customer goodies. You do not have to interact with the 
customer, just give me what I need to keep them satisfied.

Thoughts? Feel free to e-mail me off-list if you want.

Leam
