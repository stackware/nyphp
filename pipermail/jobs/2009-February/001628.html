</I>    I wouldn't get involved in an equity relationship of any kind unless 
I knew the people involved and believed in the business.  For instance,  
a friend of mine was having trouble getting a bank loan to start a 
business -- I suggested to him that he try equity financing.  I chipped 
in a little money and so did about ten of his friends.  Now the business 
is doing well and has expanded into a new location.

    I got burned once by somebody who offered me 50% of payment in 
equity for a company that he later sold.  In that case,  the business 
was an international affair that was based in the Virgin Islands and 
doing business in Latin America.  I suppose I could have recovered $50k 
or so with a lot of trouble,   but I already moved on and didn't need 
the hassle.  The &quot;offshore&quot; business was a source of entertainment for 
me:  the owner would sign me on as a contact person and I'd get phone 
calls from people who wondered if our business was a scam.
