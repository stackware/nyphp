So I'm running a hot startup that just launched in beta. We need a  
kickass lead developer, you know the type, eat pizza, red bull, no  
sleep that can iterate like a madman and has built payment systems  
(like an elance.com system).Our founders have built and sold a half  
dozen companies, created over $5BN in shareholder value and taken a  
company public in the past. This is an equity role, soon to be paying  
cash to help complete our product from beta to live. We are very well  
connected and solving a major problem for marketers.

I don't think so. Good experienced and available engineer/developers are 
really hard gems to find.
You could hire three less experienced $50K/yr developers, stumble 
through a 4 month project, maybe dragging it out to 6 or 7 months..
or hire one very experienced $115K developer to get the same thing done 
in 3 months under budget.

That 10-year engineer has likely possesses the experience which allows 
him/her to foresee and divert projects from pitfalls which less 
experienced developers eventually learn also.

Quick story (related):  A few winters back, I drove over a patch of ice 
and spun my car off the road slamming hard into the curb. When the car 
came to rest, the rear wheel was 45 degrees off from it's original 
position. I had the vehicle towed to a local auto shop who informed me 
that everything from the wheel up to the transmission needed to be 
replaced and it would cost several thousand dollars.

My normal trusty mechanic (who charges about 20% more than the local 
shops) was located 35 miles away. I paid to have my car towed on a 
flatbed from the local shop 35 miles over to him. The next day my 
mechanic called and said he had it fixed for $220. He went to the back 
of his shop,  took a piece off a spare care, welded it on to mine and 
things were as good as new.

I think time and time again, the more experienced worker will find 
faster and cheaper ways to get things done better and more efficiently.. 
and that is worth a premium.

Webmiester,

Not sure what prompted such a puerile response. I am a senior PHP developer working on a high-traffic website and I make more than that (on a contract but no overtime), I have a f friend starting on Monday at $120,000, and another friend started last month full-time at $135,000.

As you see from above, senior people with high tarffic experience get that kind of money, so that's reality. It's everyone's favorite passtime to sling mud at recruiters but I think Chris knows what he is doing and is being rather on point in this case. 

If you have nothing constructive to add (personal experience, numbers, etc) please refrain from emailing everyone. Your sarcastic "Good luck!" doesn't contribute anything but negativity to this list, especially when you remember that it's mainly a list for PHP developers who would obviously disagree that a decent salary is a reason to throw up.

So I'm running a hot startup that just launched in beta. We need a
kickass lead developer, you know the type, eat pizza, red bull, no sleep
that can iterate like a madman and has built payment systems (like an
elance.com system).Our founders have built and sold a half dozen
companies, created over $5BN in shareholder value and taken a company
public in the past. This is an equity role, soon to be paying cash to
help complete our product from beta to live. We are very well connected
and solving a major problem for marketers.

I don't think so. Good experienced and available engineer/developers are
really hard gems to find.
You could hire three less experienced $50K/yr developers, stumble
through a 4 month project, maybe dragging it out to 6 or 7 months..
or hire one very experienced $115K developer to get the same thing done
in 3 months under budget.

That 10-year engineer has likely possesses the experience which allows
him/her to foresee and divert projects from pitfalls which less
experienced developers eventually learn also.

Quick story (related):  A few winters back, I drove over a patch of ice
and spun my car off the road slamming hard into the curb. When the car
came to rest, the rear wheel was 45 degrees off from it's original
position. I had the vehicle towed to a local auto shop who informed me
that everything from the wheel up to the transmission needed to be
replaced and it would cost several thousand dollars.

My normal trusty mechanic (who charges about 20% more than the local
shops) was located 35 miles away. I paid to have my car towed on a
flatbed from the local shop 35 miles over to him. The next day my
mechanic called and said he had it fixed for $220. He went to the back
of his shop,  took a piece off a spare care, welded it on to mine and
things were as good as new.

I think time and time again, the more experienced worker will find
faster and cheaper ways to get things done better and more efficiently..

and that is worth a premium.

Webmiester,

Not sure what prompted such a puerile response. I am a senior PHP
developer working on a high-traffic website and I make more than that
(on a contract but no overtime), I have a f friend starting on Monday at
$120,000, and another friend started last month full-time at $135,000.

As you see from above, senior people with high tarffic experience get
that kind of money, so that's reality. It's everyone's favorite passtime
to sling mud at recruiters but I think Chris knows what he is doing and
is being rather on point in this case. 

If you have nothing constructive to add (personal experience, numbers,
etc) please refrain from emailing everyone. Your sarcastic "Good luck!"
doesn't contribute anything but negativity to this list, especially when
you remember that it's mainly a list for PHP developers who would
obviously disagree that a decent salary is a reason to throw up.
