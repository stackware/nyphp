<PRE>Hi everyone,

Reflexions Data is a web development firm based in White Plains, NY that 
is currently seeking part-time and full-time PHP developers to assist 
with ongoing projects.  On-site availability is preferred but not required.

Do you read Slashdot every day? Do you see regular expressions in your 
dreams and write Python code for fun? Think you've got what it takes to 
be a developer at Reflexions Data?  Then we encourage you to introduce 
yourself.

Candidates should have extensive experience with PHP versions 4.x and 
5.x, object-oriented software principles, agile development 
methodologies, and PHP development frameworks. Intimate knowledge of 
SQL-based databases is also required, including query optimization and 
database normalization principles.

Hourly rate is $35-$60/hour, based on level of experience.  These are 
potential contract-to-hire positions.

Candidates must be willing to work in a closely knit team environment 
and must demonstrate a passion for solving business problems with 
technology. BA/BS in computer science or similar field is preferred.

Submit an online application here for the &quot;PHP Developer&quot; position:
