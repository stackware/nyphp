<PRE>

My name is Alison, a recruiter with Technology Brokers in Princeton, NJ.
I am currently looking for a PHP/Java/MYSQL developer to work with a great online media company in NYC. This is an on-site position. 
They are looking to build out a Reporting and Administration Platform (so any web reporting, analystics, or online advertising experience would be great, but not necessary).
I am looking for someone with strong GUI skills, PHP frontend, Java API, and MySQL or similar DB experience. Need someone familiar with the full SDLC..need to take and recommend user requirements then develop, test and implement both front to back. 
 
If interested, please email me  a word copy of your resume to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">arein at thebrokersgrp.com</A> or call me at (609) 924-8900 x204. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you!
