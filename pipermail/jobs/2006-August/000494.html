About exhibit-E
exhibit-E was created in 1998 by Dan Miller Design. Dan Miller Design  
was founded in 1985 as a New York based graphic design firm with an  
emphasis on design for art galleries. We are a company with 20 years  
experience in the art world. The firm works closely with art  
galleries worldwide, offering broad based design services to a range  
of international clients. With the launch of exhibit-E in 1998, we  
began to offer website design services tailored specifically to the  
needs of the art world. Our websites are distinguished by a high  
level of design combined with self-administration, which allows our  
clients, (including the world&#8217;s top galleries and dealers), to  
maintain their websites in-house.

In addition to our work in the art world we provide creative services  
and website design in the fields of home furnishing, interior design,  
photography, travel and leisure, parks and private estates. We pride  
ourselves in establishing long-term client relationships and seek  
clients with similar goals.
