Can anyone explain why this lists members emails and email addresses are 
being stored?  And why they are visible to anyone who may want to 
search?  Can they be archived but not visible?

Can we have at least some publicly inaccessible discussion among members 
of this list?

My employer would be unhappy to see me looking elsewhere.

It might actually make sense to not maintain a public archive of this  
list, as opposed to, say nyphp-talk.  It's not really clear what value  
an archive of a -jobs list would have.

OTOH, if you don't want your employer to know that you're looking  
elsewhere, you could simply lurk and not post.

Thought I suppose it's a little late for that now :-)

Startup enthusiasts take note, this is a great chance to get in on the ground floor of a 1 year old startup in NYC that is already delivering a high-end consumer experience, which has resulted in profitability at this early stage of my client's evolution.  I am not looking for Rockstar, Ninja or coders who wear tight leather pants and ski masks to work.  I am looking for a smart PHP engineer with a solid understanding  of scalable web development and the ability to communicate effectively.  The platform is a high volume low latency transactional system.  The team size is about 20 people.   Competitive offers come with stock options. 

 

This PHP development position reports to the Vice President of Engineering whom we placed into his current role.   You will be joining a team of engineers who were recruited out of brand name companies and have enthusiastically signed up for something they believe will be great. 

 

Technical requirements for this role include:




	- 3 - 5 years of experience working on the LAMP stack. 

	- Strong server side and database development experience. 

	- An interest in architecture and debunking the myth that PHP does not scale.  

	- Experience with 1 or more Content Management System.


	- The ability to discuss how PHP compiles and a strong grasp of HTTP Protocol

Message-ID: <A7BFCF76B50E9E47B6DE68B113585949F0E834@osdc01.Oakridge.local>

I'm looking for a LAMP Performance expert for a White Plains, NY based
client.  Client has multiple high traffic web sites in various
development and QA stages and is experiencing severe performance issues.
Clients not sure if it's development (PHP), Server or a configuration
issues are the problem.  

 

I'm looking for a LAMP "management consultant" to drop in and help
diagnose and fix the issue.  Consultant needs to have a background in
all aspects of the LAMP stack.  Part developer, part administrator, part
analyst ect.  

 

My client also utilizing Drupal as the CM system and I'm sure this has a
role in the whole process.  

 

Client wants to interview ASAP and have someone start soon.  Contract
should last 3-6 months, but extension or ongoing support may be an
option.  This role needs a senior person and I expect the rate to
reflect this.

AppNexus is hiring!

We are looking for a software engineer with solid object-oriented PHP 5 development experience to become a core member of a sharp, dynamic team. AppNexus clients trade on a steady stream of online media through our real-time transactional platform, a distributed system built on top of the AppNexus computing cloud that responds in a few milliseconds to billions of requests each day - 24/7, 365 days a year.

We need an efficient and agile engineer motivated by solving interesting technical challenges and building new applications quickly. Our team is rapidly developing both RESTful APIs and rich user interfaces for our clients and in need of engineers to help take us to the next level.

The position requires a problem solving mindset as much as it requires strong PHP web software development skills. The ideal candidate is hands-on when designing applications and is comfortable coding off of a problem statement instead of a formal spec. Our environment is open, collaborative, and encourages learning. We release new code at least once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases reliability), so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and confident in your work. You'll immediately see the results of your work and creativity - as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world at large.

Requirements:
?2+ years of production development experience
?Proficiency in Object Oriented PHP 5 and Design Patterns
?Proficiency in SQL and experience with MySQL.
?Experience with server side application development and web-services, especially REST
?Experience with writing unit tests within a testing framework
?Experience in LAMP development and version control
?Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24/7 environment

Desirable:
?Experience developing scalable web-services
?Advanced JavaScript, AJAX, HTML and CSS usage, jQuery framework preferred

evolve into.

We use some great cutting edge technology, especially with regards to our
heavy dependence on MongoDB. Our team works closely with the MongoDB
development team over at 10gen and we often get to live on the bleeding edge
of its development. If this scares you overly, you're probably not right for
us.

with experience in Objective C would have the opportunity to pitch in on
that.

Position requirements are as follows:

Skilled backend programmers who can write lean object-oriented PHP 5 code
Strong front end javascript and CSS knowledge a plus
Knowledge of Photoshop and a sense of design also a plus
Dreams in code and is willing to eat bugs for lunch. Beer will be provided
to wash them down.

Experience with NoSQL document-based DB stores such as MongoDB a major plus
Objective-C iPhone/iPad development experience also a major plus
Based in New York -- you will need to be able to work out of our office on
5th Avenue. Some telecommuting is fine.

We have a great balance between the excitement and dynamism of a startup
while offering a lot of flexibility so you can still have a life. We want
motivated self-starters who don't need to be micro-managed, our focus is on
getting the job done, not about putting in some defined amount of time. We
offer a competitive salary and good benefits.

Technologies we use include Linux, PHP 5.3, Apache, MongoDB, Amazon SQS,
Memcached, and Objective-C.

To apply, please reply with a cover letter, resume, and a short code sample.
