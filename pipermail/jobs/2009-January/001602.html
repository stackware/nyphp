<PRE>(note: this is a full-time, on-site position in Manhattan. Please, NO  
RECRUITERS and no off-site contractors or agencies).

Position Description:

What are you passionate about? Affinitive (www.beaffinitive.com) is  
seeking an experienced Lead/Senior Software Engineer to manage and  
contribute to Affintive's day-to-day, social media-driven technology- 
related operations. We've got an awesome work environment full of  
creative marketers and technologists, and are looking for someone who  
can thrive within our casual, yet hard-working company culture.

This is a senior-level role with a small development team, so the  
ability to operate as both a leader and as an individual contributor  
is a must. Reporting to the company President, you will act as a  
liaison between the development team and marketing/project managers.  
You will be responsible for ensuring the technology team meets  
deadlines, stays on budget and continues to innovate.

You must be both a left- and right- brained thinker, wearing a  
&quot;startup&quot; hat in terms of being an agile, &quot;ninja&quot; developer  
responsible for evolving and innovating Affinitive's technologies, and  
an &quot;agency&quot; hat in terms of thriving in a fast-paced, marketing-based  
agency environment where solutions are applied in custom, creative  
ways for clients across industry verticals (as well as internally).  
You will act both as a mentor to our engineering team and as a client- 
facing technician able to articulate very detailed issues to non- 
technical people.

Although our solutions are proprietary, we embrace and leverage open- 
source technologies so you must possess expertise across the entire  
LAMP stack, and have proven experience developing robust, highly  
scalable, Web-based platforms (preferably multi-tenant, SaaS-based  
solutions related to social media, online communities, or CRM).

Qualifications:

&#8226; 5-8 years of experience (3+ as lead) architecting and developing

Sphinx), cloud computing and storage (S3, E3), *nix administration,

(replication, sharding), server monitoring (Nagios, Cacti), SVN, unit  
testing (Selenium), bug tracking systems (Trac, Mantis), XHTML, XML/ 
RSS, CSS
&#8226; Experience with agile and test-driven development processes

management systems (CMS), and legacy systems
&#8226; Security experience in roles/authentication/authorization, single- 
sign-on (SSO) and protocols (Facebook connect, OpenID), and cross-site  
connectivity
&#8226; Facebook/OpenSocial and iPhone application development experience
&#8226; Expertise with other scripting and object-oriented programming  
languages

Ideal Background/Profile:

objectives

&#8226; Ability to multitask and respond to dynamically changing priorities
&#8226; Ability to think creatively and solve problems
&#8226; Excellent oral and written communication skills
