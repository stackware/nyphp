Why is this being posted to the list? I was under the impression it was a
job posting list for developers in NYC.

I can't think of anyone on this list in the NYC area willing to sit and
develop an application at this price and to have an organization in India
post a message here under cutting every ones based price.  Is
Offensive..!!!!!!!

We want the development jobs in *NYC* not India that's why the list is *
nyphp-jobs*.

Nothing personal - Just business.

Chauncey,

Please don't start flaming.
I think anyone in the world can join the list, even the ones that do
not live exactly in NYC.
If the guy thinks it's enough to him to get 15 USD/hour, leave him
alone. It's not you or anyone else that should judge other people.

Also, skills you only get with time. Any company can think that pay 3
USD/hour is a good thing, but later it can really see if it was a good
thing or not.

Anyway, I'm suspicious too to talk. I live in Brazil and I follow this
list because sometimes we get interesting talks about interviews, etc.


Cheers,

Anyone can go on Craig's List and find pages of "budget minded" people 
who are seeking skilled programmers for $10/hr.

Of course, one also sees the same people advertising months later 
for "market rate" programmers to fix whatever didn't turn out the way 
it should have in their $10-an-hr fantasy of an outcome.

Important skills needed to be successful in developing applications for 
business are: knowledge of business processes, various industries' data 
formats and tasks, how to interview the users in a way that lets them 
tell you what you need to know about what they want in an application 
even when they say they are "not sure", and just general exposure to 
and ability to glean the culture and language of, the environment you 
are coding for -- and these are the types of skills lacking in overseas 
development teams.

These are also the types of skills that developers taking on "mid 
sized" projects must have because there is no fancy business analyst in 
a suit to deal with these issues for you...

I would share this with my friends but I don't have any friends in India.

Nor do I get work from India.

That's why I'm on this NEW YORK PHP list.  For New York PHP jobs.  NEW YORK!

Start your own IndiaPHP list.

Thank you,


Rob

    People in India don't get work from India.  A big drop in the dollar 
would be good because it would bring jobs back to the US and encourage 
other countries to develop balanced local markets in goods and services.

    There are some world-class organizations in India,  and there are a 
lot of smaller ones that aren't so good.  Overall,  India tends to 
underprice software development work (and other white collar) done in 
the US by about 2/3.  In the better cases,  you're paying for more 
people and for people to manage the extra people,  and get good 
results.  In the worst cases,  you just get ripped.

Folks,

I was not trying to be rude or disrespectful to the person who posted the
advertisement.  I monitor the list for Jobs in NYC to see what employers are
looking for. Seeing someone posting an Ad for what is .75 above minimum wage
here.  I have ZERO desire to compete with those prices regardless of the
state of the application after developed.

I've been developing PHP application for over 7 year and my base price is 8
times the lowest they would take to develop an application. I'm sure there
are other PHP developer here in NYC that are in the same boat. Why would we
want those types of Ads.

I'm sure there are some skilled PHP developers in India that are willing to
write applications for 8-15 USD. But no skilled PHP developer in the NY is
going to work for those prices and I spoke up to halt the competition.
Nothing personal (and I mean that)

To be honest I didn't really have a problem with the Ad but when it said 8 -
15 USD. I couldn't let it slide.
When it comes to "*jobs*" I only care if PHP recruiters and/or developers in
NYC benefit from this list and that message didn't benefit anyone in NYC.


Thanks.

I for one am grateful to see the passionate opinions being voiced 
here.  In an industry where so much is expected of us in terms of 
knowledge and commitment, and which has been subjected like no other 
profession to the forces of "globalization" (i.e. wage reduction), we 
do need to consider, really, how offensive it truly is that anyone 
feels our work is worth "minimum wage".  

And we are subjected to insulting stereotypes which hold that "computer 
geeks" enjoy their work too much to care about what they get paid, or 
that all we need are some old T-shirts and some cold pizza and we are 
good to go...and how much can that cost?  Please, programmers are not 
all the same, and some even have families they need to support, or 
possibly even other goals besides spending the rest of their lives 
toiling over a hot text editor for practically no money...*GASP*.

This all comes back to the issue that I feel is at the core of 
things...the lack of licensing or credentialling organizations in our 
field that would perform the core functions that they do in other 
industries...namely to maintain a certain exclusivity of talent and to 
fight against economic pressures seeking to dampen wage or salary rates 
in our industry.  Or a programmer's union that could mandate that the 
MINIMUM hourly rate for any union programmer is $40 or $50 or whatever 
they decide on...and make it hard on companies that don't use union 
programmers...or whatever the solution might be.

I feel that attempting to take work away from NYC programmers by 
undercutting our billing rates to the tune of 8 DOLLARS AN HOUR should 
be explicitly prohibited on this list, because it IS offensive, and 
even potentially harmful.

Happy coding everyone, 

Kristina

I'm not sure a Union would solve the problem. I've been exposed to a number
of Union workers and they become very complacent knowing that they going to
be making the same regardless. I feel this could de-value the profession.

Chauncey, 

Your point about unions is very valid and of course, I was just putting 
out suggestions because we would, naturally, as programmers want to 
examine every tiny nuance of any potential solutions and analyze them 
until the cows come home for robustness and completeness...

But, as a population, programmers tend to be extremely self-motivating 
and conscientious about their work product, investing each 1000 lines 
of generated code with a pregnancy of meaning that makes a Presidential 
Election or World Series seem positively insignificant in comparison.  
Therefore, I'd personally expect that the "union effect" you describe 
below would be less pronounced among programmers than in other 
populations.

And besides, what's wrong with getting paid to do nothing once in 
awhile, most other people get paid to do nothing all the time :)

I am a technical recuriter based out of the NYC area.   I can tell you right now I have jobs paying  150k with 300K total package that we cannot find people for right in Manhattan.  The one's that are qualified are all working and won't consider it.  I speak to consultants all the time who will not get off the sofa unless they get 95.00 per hour.  ( Some would view 95.00 as a pay cut).   It all comes down to skill set.  For every job that is being offshored...there are other jobs cannot be offshored nor is there any intention of being offshored.

Just recently I was looking for Strong PHP/Drupal developer...cannot tell you how many people I spoke who just wouldn't consider a job unless they got paid $100.00 per hour.   Offshoring is hear to stay...its not just in the computer programming world.  If companies can get the same thing done at a cheaper rate its going to go abroad.  If they need a real heavy hitter its going to stay here.  The sooner people stop viewing themselves as victims and focus on what you have control over the quicker you will solve your problems.  I can tell you first hand there are whole classes of programmers who don't share these views.

I'm not sure a Union would solve the problem. I've been exposed to a number of Union workers and they become very complacent knowing that they going to be making the same regardless. I feel this could de-value the profession.

undercutting our billing rates to the tune of 8 DOLLARS AN HOUR should
be explicitly prohibited on this list, because it IS offensive, and
even potentially harmful.

Good point. People don't always offshore because its cheaper, there is
a talent gap somewhere aswell.

I am based in India aswell, represent a software firm and I can tell
you this, eventually Indian firms and US software firms would be
competing on skills & service rather than solely on price because the
prices are evening out overall in both markets anyways.

Currently though there is a price difference (no 8$ or even 15$ is not
even a fair price even in India). But providers/programmers in US have
other advantages over India programmers - proximity, location,
cultural advantage, communication, skills, domain-market experience
etc etc.

This might pinch some, but frankly if i owned a web consulting
business in US, and hiring programmers offshore saves me say 40% of my
expenditure, it can be the difference between a loss making business &
a profitable one, why wldn't I do it, would i worry about my family's
well being/investors first or care about a nagging employee who is
looking for a pay hike in a bad economy & not helping my business much
anyways?

We have firms who would become loss making the day they hire local
staff (for some skills if they can even manage to find local staff it
would be surprising), they are only profitable because they have a
managed team in India.

All's fair here, Its just how you sell on your strength. All about ROI.

 Just my 2 cents, no right or wrongs here.

Message-ID: <1251298182.11780@coral.he.net>

Let's be realy clear here and clarify that nobody that responded to 
this thread -- myself, Chauncey or the other NYC PHPers, ever made ANY 
comment about "not being able to find work" and I'm puzzled and 
concerned about why it's being turned into that.

Do employers and recruiters really fear empowered technical employees 
to that extent, that any discussion by us about empowering ourselves 
economically has to be turned into a bogus claim that we're whiny and 
unemployed?

Subject: RE: [nycphp-jobs] looking for medium size projects


Let's be realy clear here and clarify that nobody that responded to 
this thread -- myself, Chauncey or the other NYC PHPers, ever made ANY 
comment about "not being able to find work" and I'm puzzled and 
concerned about why it's being turned into that.

Do employers and recruiters really fear empowered technical employees 
to that extent, that any discussion by us about empowering ourselves 
economically has to be turned into a bogus claim that we're whiny and 
unemployed?

I have had several people contact me and I will say here what I said to them.  The 300K package type jobs are not PHP positions.  They are C++/Java/C# positions involved with developing trading systems.  My point was to illustrate many high paying jobs are sitting unfilled here in NYC simply because there is not enough people to fill them.  These jobs are not being outsourced.  As a recruiter I suffer as much as anyone when something is outsourced to India..however everytime gets outsourced it seems another skill set is needed here and only.

Below is the relevant  excerpt from an article that just appeared in the New York Times  regarding the programmer who was caught stealing from Goldman.... This guy would be a typical example of what we deal with.  (Hence 300K package is viewed with a yawn).

Mr. Aleynikov immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1991. In 1998, he joined IDT a telecommunications company, where he wrote software to route calls and data more efficiently. In 2007, Goldman hired him as a vice president, paying him $400,000 a year, according to the federal complaint against him..... This spring, Mr. Aleynikov quit Goldman to join Teza Technologies, a new trading firm, tripling his salary to about $1.2 million, according to the complaint.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/business/24trading.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Goldman%20Sachs%20and%20programmer&st=cse
As for Drupal/Php developers..it is absolute true. Like ANY skill set, your going to find people all over the range.  I spoke to enough of them where people commanding that kind of rate is not an aberration.
As for you Rob, you can continue to believe in whatever you would like, amazing at how sure you are of yourself.

I'm not sure a Union would solve the problem. I've been exposed to a number of Union workers and they become very complacent knowing that they going to be making the same regardless. I feel this could de-value the profession.

do need to consider, really, how offensive it truly is that anyone
feels our work is worth "minimum wage".

And we are subjected to insulting stereotypes which hold that "computer

that all we need are some old T-shirts and some cold pizza and we are
good to go...and how much can that cost?  Please, programmers are not
all the same, and some even have families they need to support, or
possibly even other goals besides spending the rest of their lives
toiling over a hot text editor for practically no money...*GASP*.

This all comes back to the issue that I feel is at the core of
things...the lack of licensing or credentialling organizations in our
field that would perform the core functions that they do in other
industries...namely to maintain a certain exclusivity of talent and to
fight against economic pressures seeking to dampen wage or salary rates
in our industry.  Or a programmer's union that could mandate that the
MINIMUM hourly rate for any union programmer is $40 or $50 or whatever
they decide on...and make it hard on companies that don't use union
programmers...or whatever the solution might be.

I feel that attempting to take work away from NYC programmers by
undercutting our billing rates to the tune of 8 DOLLARS AN HOUR should
be explicitly prohibited on this list, because it IS offensive, and
even potentially harmful.

Happy coding everyone,

Kristina

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] looking for medium size projects
Message-ID: <1251315467.14822@coral.he.net>

Rob -- what's really going on is this.  

All of Wall street is looking for "that tech guy" who is going to do 
everything short of part the Red Sea for them in terms of enabling 
trading-area profits.  The one who is exactly 27 years old, has exactly 
a 3.8 GPA in the departmental area of the Ivy League university of 
their choice and who will consent to working 120-hour weeks in a 
slavepit with a bunch of animalistic traders, and who preferably will 
rat out their previous employers' trade secrets after being hired, all 
the while wearing a tie, for the "total compensation of 300K".

"That tech guy" is the Holy Grail for the technical recruiter, the one 
they all seek ... for the commission payout on a 300k deal is, for a 
technical recruiter, no small bag of chips.

So now it is late August, and a very slow part of the year in what must 
have been a very, very dismal one for Wall street technical recruiters, 
and frustration and boredom builds up while they wait for "that tech 
guy" to show up, and some of that trickles down to us on our little PHP 
jobs list, because we are not "that tech guy" but merely non-
commissionable or readily available knats buzzing around with the 
temerity to protest the advertisement of cheap $8 an hour 
outsourced "PHP engineering"...

I don't think we should take it personally.  $100/hr, that must be the 
consulting rate for "that tech guy"...?

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] looking for medium size projects
Message-ID: <1251315980.16519@coral.he.net>

Like I just said, it's a lazy late August day and you're all waiting 
for "that tech guy" their clients want for the trading systems to show 
up... :)

Somehow, Shahan, I don't really think the other 10,000 or so working 
programmers in NYC care if "that tech guy" and his 300K compensation 
get outsourced or not...?

All we want is for our skills to be valued appropriately in the 
marketplace, and for our hard work to be appreciated.  Because we 
objected to our skills being valued at $8/hr, you felt compelled to 
email us and tell us we have a "victim mentality" and I'm quite frankly 
not sure why.

Kristina

> 
> I have had several people contact me and I will say here what I said 
to them.  The 300K package type jobs are not PHP positions.  They are 
C++/Java/C# positions involved with developing trading systems.  My 
point was to illustrate many high paying jobs are sitting unfilled here 
in NYC simply because there is not enough people to fill them.  These 
jobs are not being outsourced.  As a recruiter I suffer as much as 
anyone when something is outsourced to India..however everytime gets 
outsourced it seems another skill set is needed here and only.
> 
> Below is the relevant  excerpt from an article that just appeared in 
the New York Times  regarding the programmer who was caught stealing 
from Goldman.... This guy would be a typical example of what we deal 
with.  (Hence 300K package is viewed with a yawn).
> 
> Mr. Aleynikov immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1991. In 
1998, he joined IDT a telecommunications company, where he wrote 
software to route calls and data more efficiently. In 2007, Goldman 
hired him as a vice president, paying him $400,000 a year, according to 
the federal complaint against him..... This spring, Mr. Aleynikov quit 
Goldman to join Teza Technologies, a new trading firm, tripling his 
salary to about $1.2 million, according to the complaint.

Been reading discussion and wanted to add my 2 cents.  None of this is
fair, but life isn?t fair and there is no justice, at least not in this
life.  The people who hire off Craig?s list and Guru.com at $10 an hour
are not people you want to work for.  This is why,

1 They are clueless, they don?t know enough about business to realize if
you want it done right and on time you have to pay market rate.  (They
don?t even know what market rate is)  There will be a lot of hand holding
and explaining the basics of the internet.

2 They have no respect for your profession and think anyone could do it. 
They won?t listen to any advice, and will have unrealistic expectations.

3 They will comeback time and again with changes and expect them to be free

4 They are also likely to not pay you in full

Basically you end up dealing with people like this
http://www.vendorclientvideo.com/

Most fields have a cut rate option and a high quality option.  There is
McDonald's and there are gourmet restaurants.  Some people are happy to
eat at McDonald?s, and have no one to blame but themselves when they have
a heart attack.

Interesting.  How come I haven't seen any of these $300k/year and $95/hr 
consulting gigs posted here?

Doesn't sound like PHP was mentioned in this posting. 

When I hear of packages of this size I think sales not development.

A lot of the 'high paying' jobs are going unfilled because they are in reality a big pay cut from consulting, not due to a lack of people. It's the free market at work.  I have run my own consulting company for the past 5 years - generally we have anywhere between 2 and 10 consultants on projects depending on business cycle;  I personally have two CS degrees from Carnegie Mellon and 15 years experience in Java/J2EE/SOA.  I have been an employee for 9 of those years, a consultant for 6 (I still bill myself out). The 150K base positions generally result in 60 hour work weeks; no comparison when compared to rates that are in the 90-125hr range for every hour.  I have a client in another state with a high level architect position paying 150-175 base.  Getting resumes has been extremely difficult - the problem is not a lack of interested people, the problem is they require full time status.  That kills the interest.

I have dealt with a lot of PHPers.  I've never had one ask for $95.  They know their value in general.

Unions are not the answer (I don't see outsourcing as a problem).  Unions are for industries where there is little differentiation in productivity.  The difference in productivity between a good and bad developer is orders of magnitude.

I have run my own consulting company for the past 5 years - generally we have anywhere between 2 and 10 consultants on projects depending on business cycle;  I personally have two CS degrees from Carnegie Mellon and 15 years experience in Java/J2EE/SOA.  I have been an employee for 9 of those years, a consultant for 6 (I still bill myself out). The 150K base positions generally result in 60 hour work weeks; no comparison when compared to rates that are in the 90-125hr range for every hour.  I have a client in another state with a high level architect position paying 150-175 base.  Getting resumes has been extremely difficult - the problem is not a lack of interested people, the problem is they require full time status.  That kills the interest.

    I used to believe that thing about developer productivity,  but now 
I don't.

    The environment in which you are working has a big effect on your 
productivity.  If you're developing command-line batch processing 
scripts,  and the requirements are well known,  you can be 10x more 
productive than you can be in a project where you get useless 
requirements documents,  need to argue with your boss to get to talk to 
the customers to revisit the spec,  then leave ten phone messages for 
the customers,  finally get to talk to them,  have a good conversation 
about the specs -- then they call you back an hour later and you need to 
explain the business process model that you worked out again.  Then 
there's the week it takes to go back and forth with the GUI designer,  etc.

    Early studies in software engineering showed that "coding" is about 
1/5 of the time it takes to design an app:  you've also got testing, 
deployment,  requirements work, and design.  Even if you could eliminate 
the coding time to zero with some supercompiler or by hiring a 
superdeveloper,  you're still left with 4/5 of the time consumed by 
other activities.

    We've all encountered "superproductive" developers whose MO is to do 
the 20% of the work that gets 80% of the results,  and then split town.  
A developer who's got a lot more skill and really understands what it 
takes to get things into production ends up looking like a plodding 
idiot in comparison,  because they're the ones who have to normalize the 
database tables,  add the "htmlspecialchars()" so that the app isn't 
busted when somebody types a quote into a form field,  deal with 
cross-browser issues and all the other stuff that takes a lot of time.  
The "plodder" knows perfectly well that the app would have been better 
off it building it in a framework,  but got involved too late in the 
game to really make that move.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] enough already!
Message-ID: <f9d876fd0908280814s5e533be2q9c67084e74daa751@mail.gmail.com>

When I get emails from this list, I'm excited to see what new job
opportunities have surfaced.  Can we please stop this thread already?
 Nothing of value has been said in awhile, and every time I open another
email from the list I'm disappointed to see that it's just another response
to "looking for medium size projects".
Thanks
Scott
