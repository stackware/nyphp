- Good understanding of: Smarty templates, PEAR

At least 2 years of experience in programming websites

Not quite a hijack.  I took a quick look at it and approved it; probably

We are a small design firm finishing up a few large projects and find 
ourselves needing an extra hand for some PHP work. This is a temporary 
freelance position. You must have a good solid comprehension of OOP. 
You must be able to show us previous work you have done which is still 
currently online. You must be able to work from our studio in Financial 
District.

Please email the following info to daniel at fdtdesign.com

? your online portfolio showing your previous work in PHP.
? a brief list of former employers and/or clients you've worked with.
? your daytime phone number.
? your availability.

Our lead PHP programmer is leaving in July, so this could very well 
turn into a regular gig for the right person. We love to work with 
freelancers and other like-minded hard-working creative thinkers

I am looking for occasional consulting help, usually integrating PHP 
with IBM Informix SE and MySQL or other similar packages.  If anyone 
out there is a consultant or knows of a consultant who would be 
comfortable looking at Informix (it's getting dated..!) I would 
appreciate hearing from you.
