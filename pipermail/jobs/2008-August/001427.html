<PRE>Great article.  Thanks!  

As far as equity goes, I have &quot;equity&quot; in a project which I did last 
winter.  Most of the time these people pay a few grand in cash, which 
for the hours worked ends up being like $10 an hour or less, 
and &quot;equity&quot;, and then just expect the thing to sell itself after you 
build it.  If they don't have the cash to pay you to build it, you KNOW 
they don't have the cash to market it and make it profitable.  I think 
any competent engineer can calculate the value of 10% of ZERO...

NEVER AGAIN.  My landlord, and the grocery store, don't accept a 
promise of &quot;equity&quot; as payment.  I learned the hard way not to go this 
route.  Maybe 1 out of 1,000 projects might be worth doing on that 
basis....maybe.

</I>&gt;<i> As a member of several NYC networking groups, I can promise you that
</I>&gt;<i> ideas (both good and bad) are a dime a dozen, it's all on the
</I>&gt;<i> execution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you're not looking for freebies, but if you are I recommend
</I>&gt;<i> against it. You might have more luck finding a developer that will
</I>&gt;<i> lower their wages in exchange for equity, or if you're absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> desperate, outsource the work developing a prototype, sell your idea
</I>&gt;<i> to investors, and then hire programmers to execute.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Got a Great Big Idea - Need a 
</I>Developer/Partner toMake
&gt;<i> &gt; it Happen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for 
</I>quite a
&gt;<i> &gt; while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but at 
</I>the same
&gt;<i> &gt; time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a real 
</I>try.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful 
</I>realization
&gt;<i> &gt; that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor 
</I>job of
&gt;<i> &gt; bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media 
</I>industry
&gt;<i> &gt; hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential 
</I>to solve
&gt;<i> &gt; many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and 
</I>promising
&gt;<i> &gt; original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to 
</I>get their
&gt;<i> &gt; lucky break. I think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that 
</I>this is
&gt;<i> &gt; an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and 
</I>therefore worth
&gt;<i> &gt; trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, 
</I>including
&gt;<i> &gt; other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone 
</I>they
&gt;<i> &gt; know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because 
</I>something
&gt;<i> &gt; like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's 
</I>entire
&gt;<i> &gt; history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self 
</I>sustainable and
&gt;<i> &gt; unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; industry.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose 
</I>features can be
&gt;<i> &gt; logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and 
</I>could be up
&gt;<i> &gt; and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources was built and successfully tested). However I need 
</I>someone who
&gt;<i> &gt; will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new 
</I>pieces of the
&gt;<i> &gt; puzzle are being implemented and thought up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with 
</I>UGC and a
&gt;<i> &gt; CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them 
</I>for the
&gt;<i> &gt; long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical 
</I>team/partner(s) to
&gt;<i> &gt; really make this idea and vision happen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't 
</I>think I'm a
&gt;<i> &gt; nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your 
</I>qualifications and
&gt;<i> &gt; I'll let you know more of the details.
