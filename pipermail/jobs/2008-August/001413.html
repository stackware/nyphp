<PRE>Speaking of valuable dialogue here on our jobs discussion list, the 
below job listing prompts me to comment:

Why not just come out and say that you are looking for some 24 year old 
(&quot;We are young, successful, and fun&quot;) who is willing to work 60 hours a 
week for what did you say, 45K?? (&quot;Salary Range:   45-75 k depending on 
experience&quot;).

&quot;INCENTIVES
&gt;<i> Occasional company happy hours&quot;
</I>
This means that in addition to working 60 hours a week for slave wages, 
you also want me to spend some of my very valuable free time drinking 
with you and pretending to actually like you??  Oh dear.  How much did 
you say you were going to pay me, again?

&quot;&gt; Access to company ZipCar account&quot;

No doubt because of another night working until 11 PM, methinks...?

Also, detailed enumeration of company paid holidays is really not 
necessary in an initial ad...it's not as though all the other companies 
don't have the same deal.

Eek.
