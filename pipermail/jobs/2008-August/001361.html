<PRE>I don't think we are trying to kill off the competition just raise the  
bar of professionalism.

Ben in his post didn't say outright, Sundar was a bad programmer or  
someone you shouldn't work with. He gave a description of Sundar's  
work and recommended that you request a work sample.  There might be  
people who don't care about or know what  OOP, Database encapsulation  
or MVC is, for those people Sundar is some you might want to with.

Another issue this brings up is,  PHP and web developers are looked  
down on as Hacks. I work for a Financial Services Technology Company  
and work with Java, C and C++ developers everyday. They don't think  
very much of PHP developers. But when they see me use OOP,  Database  
Encapsulation, MVC  etc... They are very shocked and surprised.  I  
have been asked by a C++ developer if PHP has arrays.  LOL

This negative image of PHP and Web Developers is based on their past  
experience, working with developers who work the same way Sundar  
does.  We all have seen people who code like this. Doesn't mean Sundar  
is a bad person or never work with the guy. He just has to grow.

Sundar will be fine and will be a better developer out of this, I know  
it isn't easy. It's not fun but he will improve out of this.
