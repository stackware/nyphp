<PRE>I recommend this article/post:

<A HREF="http://codeclimber.blogspot.com/2008/04/all-i-need-is-programmer.html">http://codeclimber.blogspot.com/2008/04/all-i-need-is-programmer.html</A>

As a member of several NYC networking groups, I can promise you that
ideas (both good and bad) are a dime a dozen, it's all on the
execution.

Maybe you're not looking for freebies, but if you are I recommend
against it. You might have more luck finding a developer that will
lower their wages in exchange for equity, or if you're absolutely
desperate, outsource the work developing a prototype, sell your idea
to investors, and then hire programmers to execute.

Hope that helps,

- Brian D.

</I>&gt;<i> From: New Media Concept

</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Tuesday, August 19, 2008 9:24 PM
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Got a Great Big Idea - Need a Developer/Partner toMake
</I>&gt;<i> it Happen
</I>&gt;<i> I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for quite a
</I>&gt;<i> while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a real try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful realization
</I>&gt;<i> that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor job of
</I>&gt;<i> bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media industry
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential to solve
</I>&gt;<i> many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and promising
</I>&gt;<i> original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to get their
</I>&gt;<i> lucky break. I think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that this is
</I>&gt;<i> an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and therefore worth
</I>&gt;<i> trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, including
</I>&gt;<i> other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone they
</I>&gt;<i> know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because something
</I>&gt;<i> like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's entire
</I>&gt;<i> history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self sustainable and
</I>&gt;<i> unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire
</I>&gt;<i> industry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose features can be
</I>&gt;<i> logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured
</I>&gt;<i> product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and could be up
</I>&gt;<i> and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source
</I>&gt;<i> resources was built and successfully tested). However I need someone who
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new pieces of the
</I>&gt;<i> puzzle are being implemented and thought up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with UGC and a
</I>&gt;<i> CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them for the
</I>&gt;<i> long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical team/partner(s) to
</I>&gt;<i> really make this idea and vision happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't think I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your qualifications and
</I>&gt;<i> I'll let you know more of the details.
