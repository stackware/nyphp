<PRE>I have a great big idea too, there are only 2 main competitors..  
downfall is i do not have the ability to fund the project even though  
i would do all the programming myself there is server admin, front end  
designer / js guys etc.

The only way I could get this off the ground would be to use a  
template (i refuse to) or get friends to join in the deal.

Trying to sell something to someone for 10% of ZERO is not going to  
work.

&gt;<i> I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for quite  
</I>&gt;<i> a while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but  
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less  
</I>&gt;<i> than a real try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful  
</I>&gt;<i> realization that it's probably the only industry that does an  
</I>&gt;<i> incredibly poor job of bringing in new people and new ideas. At the  
</I>&gt;<i> same time the media industry hasn't changed much even as technology  
</I>&gt;<i> has given it the potential to solve many of these issues. The end  
</I>&gt;<i> result is more misses than hits, and promising original talent being  
</I>&gt;<i> burned out as they tire out from trying to get their lucky break. I  
</I>&gt;<i> think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that  
</I>&gt;<i> this is an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and  
</I>&gt;<i> therefore worth trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in  
</I>&gt;<i> the industry, including other artists and creatives, who all tell me  
</I>&gt;<i> that they and everyone they know would jump at the chance to partake  
</I>&gt;<i> in that concept because something like this has been sorely lacking  
</I>&gt;<i> in the industry for nearly it's entire history. So in the end, it  
</I>&gt;<i> could be at the very least a self sustainable and unique niche site,  
</I>&gt;<i> or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire industry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose  
</I>&gt;<i> features can be logically implemented over time to create an ever  
</I>&gt;<i> more full featured product. The first iteration of the concept would  
</I>&gt;<i> be simple and could be up and running fairly fast(in fact a simple  
</I>&gt;<i> prototype using open source resources was built and successfully  
</I>&gt;<i> tested). However I need someone who will be able to take it beyond  
</I>&gt;<i> that, and keep it going as new pieces of the puzzle are being  
</I>&gt;<i> implemented and thought up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with  
</I>&gt;<i> UGC and a CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might  
</I>&gt;<i> carry them for the long haul. I'm really looking for my long term  
</I>&gt;<i> technical team/partner(s) to really make this idea and vision happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't  
</I>&gt;<i> think I'm a nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your  
</I>&gt;<i> qualifications and I'll let you know more of the details.
