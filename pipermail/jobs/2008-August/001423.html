<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Gigantic Inc., is a small multimedia design firm based in SoHo, that  
has an immediate need for a PHP/MySQL programmer to work various web  
projects. We currently have 4-5 projects on our plate that require a  
talented PHP programmer to build clean, user-friendly solutions that  
range e-commerce cart implementations to an online ordering system for  
a major reprographics company. Some of these projects will require  
building for scratch while others will be modifications of existing  
PHP programming.

We are looking for a freelancer for the next 6 months with the  
possibility of a lifetime of projects! We are amenable to off-site  
work but would prefer that you have regular meetings with us in our  
office or at least be available via iChat video conferencing. No  
offense, but we also need a good command of the English language as we  
may need you to explain things to clients.

Now here is the kicker - we got burned by a PHP programmer the last  
time we did this. His name was Tom Gillis and I am not afraid to let  
you know because if I ever see him again he will have a hard time  
looking me in the eye. But I can see from reading the threads on this  
list that there are honest and talented programmers out there that  
would like to work on projects with dedicated and knowledgeable  
people. So please, if you are a slacker and a thief, don't waste my  
time. But if you want to earn a decent wage for some mid-level to high- 
level programming needs let me know you are interested.

Responsibilities
Work with our designers and project manager to build back-end  
solutions to medium-sized database driven websites. In most cases,   
you will be working with sites that have already had the framework or  
templates built in HTML and CSS. We would like you to work with our  
design team to build out the back-end sections of the sites into  
finished products. These back-end solutions involve simple CMS  
functionality like creating dynamic pages and integrating FCKEditor or  
something similar. Also integrating phpBB Forum solutions or Blogging  
applications.

Requirements
- PHP, MySQL (AJAX would be nice, but not required)
- Integration of off-the-shelf e-commerce software or custom built  
solutions
- Clear understanding of HTML &amp; XHTML and CSS
- Knowledge of FCKEditor and phpBB integration very, very helpful
- Flash, Actionscript and XML are a big plus but not necessary
- Illustrator and Photoshop
- Strong communication skills
- Healthy desire to work with knowledgeable and really cool people

Compensation (fee based or hourly)
Depending on the complexity and scope of work, but fees usually range  
from $3,000 - $8,000 for website projects such as these: <A HREF="http://www.manhattansc.org">http://www.manhattansc.org</A> 
  or <A HREF="http://www.owlibrary.org">http://www.owlibrary.org</A> - these have a simple CMS back-end with  
integration of FCKEditor. I know this is a big range, but each project  
has a budget that we have to work within.

An hourly wage will be in the $40 - 60 range. Just work quickly ;-)

We will always do the best we can to compensate you fairly for your  
work. Sorry no bennies.


To apply, send an email and resume to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">doug at giganticinc.com.</A>

If you want to know more about Gigantic and our projects, send me an  
email.
