<PRE>Hi All,
&#160;
Thanks for all the criticism to my post &amp; the reply sent by Ben.
&#160;
Actually I never know who this guys Ben is , I have never worked with him before &amp; ofcourse he is not my client too.
&#160;
I have been in this freelancing profession for abt 3+ yrs &amp; never got such criticism from my clients , though I had troubles / faults in the project that I work with my clients , they use to tell me the changes &amp; I do make sure to deliver those changes as per the client's requests.
&#160;
I never leave my clients in trouble with frustration , even though if I do some mistakes I do admit to my clients &amp; they give me a chance to work on it &amp; prove it &amp; I have done so.
&#160;
You all can have a look at my online portfolio at <A HREF="http://www.sundarrajan.com">http://www.sundarrajan.com</A> , besides I have also been member in various freelancing forums &amp; have good client reference , reputation.
&#160;
If you all wish to help a fellow programmer like me , just request Ben to send us what project I worked that had the issues as he said. To the best of my knowledge I don't think there shud be such projects , but if there were some issues the client would have got resolved it with me , they would'nt speak bad abt me to a third party code auditor like Ben (because all the clients I have worked were very genuine , pleasant &amp; helpfull in nature).
&#160;
Pls guys never think bad &amp; have a negative impression abt me, due to Ben's posting , though I'm not located in US , I do work with clients based at US / UK etc,..
&#160;
510.455.4387 this is my US skypein number , you can call me in this number if you have issues with this post.
&#160;
I wonder why Ben has posted such critics abt my thread publicly on this forum.
&#160;
Anyway lets wait for a good solution.

I disagree. This wasn't a former employer complaining about a consultant's work, this was another consultant, a competitor if you will, stating as fact something that no one can possibly double-check. I think it's unfair, and am surprised that, on a list dedicated to helping consultants find jobs, you folks would not be more concerned about it. I think this is the first time I have seen someone in a public forum accuse someone of something and not be called to provide proof of their claims. Very puzzling.

No one knows what the job requirements were, what the client's expectations were, or what the budget was. Did the client provide enough time and budget to have the job done right, or did they just say, &quot;Get it done for next to nothing,&quot; and then when they realized the short-sidedness of their approach, hire Ben to clean up the mess rather than go back to the developer they low-balled and admit that they didn't give him enough time and $$ to do the job correctly. We don't know. Ben won't even tell the list who the client was or produce evidence of the inferior work. So to my mind, this whole thread is quite unfair to the developer who originally posted his availability and should be dropped.

Finally, as you read this, please keep in mind that we are a company that&#160; employs people on this list, that's why I subscribe. I have employed developers here in the US and in six other countries. I find *no* geo-political differences in coding skills. We evaluate developers based on samples, client references and their ability to follow directions. I have had more than a few developers who are so focused on developing &quot;great code&quot; that they completely ignore the project specs, budget and time-lines. Those people don't last long, but people who follow directions do.

Again, without knowing the original assignment that Sundar was given and what went on between he and the client at that time, facts which I doubt even Ben knows, we really can't draw any useful conclusions nor should we try.

Just my $.02.

All he did was to provide&#160;transparency, now we are&#160;discussing the issues. Kristina gave very valid points about the 'delivery of crappy code' and not being able to take action because they are in another country. &#160;


Another point is that this why we have standards of development practices, these standards shouldn't be&#160;compromised they can bend a bit but not break. Sundar needs to seek them out and adhere to them.


I know it may seem harsh but it may help Sundar down the line in his growth.. &#160;As well as protect a small struggling company, thinking they are saving money but &#160;falling into a trap.


Ben did a good thing. &#160;

I'm sorry Donna, but I disagree.
&#160;
It's perfectly fine to express a view about someone's work.
&#160;
Of course we make errors in our code, everybody does.&#160; But you can't evaluate experience without examining ones work.
&#160;
And employers DO give out this information.&#160; Especially if an individual was let go because of inability.
&#160;
Finally, I'm having a problem imagining rows of unemployed PHP coders down and out on skid-row in cardboard boxes, homeless, because their work was criticized.

Bye,

It's not only unethical to publicly disparage an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to legal action.

Have you ever made an error while performing your job duties?

Even a former employer would not give out this type of information.&#160; Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be valid?&#160;&#160;

This is not the same as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business practice.

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or
 smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

Be sure to request some source before you work with him.

- Ben
