<PRE>
Hello,
we work with start-ups from different States from some years ago.
We invest our work for equity and small amount of money in 5 start-ups.
One of the best experience we had with Toby Murdock and Mike Lewis. They 
are  co-founders of www.qloud.com ( search for &quot;MyMUSIC&quot; plug-ins on 
different social networking sites) was done by us ( they and REEA.net 
team)for shares and small amount of money at the beginning.
They respect our low rate  and they respect the equity that my new media 
shop had. They were good and find angel investors and VC's after a lot 
of work . Not easy, but we fight together for this ideas even that we 
work at thousands miles distance.
 From some months ago  www.qloud.com is part of www.buzznet.com

We work for other start-up : www.cellit.com and related media services 
in special for radio station.
We work right now in other two. One of them found the big investor and 
after almost 10months of work and some equity we have the chance to 
develop it the business for next 2-3 years.

We believe in the dreams of our business partners and we try to share 
with them our experience and in almost all the situations we understood 
what we must do and how we can recover the investment.
 From my point of view is more important to be pro-active and to try to 
help the other and to learn how we can do good businesses .
Of course that we don't invest money in something that don't have a 
business plan and  a minimum market research, but all the time I will 
say : &quot;I am interested and let's see if we can make profit and if is 
possible a big ones.&quot; :)
I think that big ideas, need big dreamers too .

Good luck to every entrepreneurs !

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has given it the potential to solve many of these issues. The end

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> burned out as they tire out from trying to get their lucky break. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore worth trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the industry, including other artists and creatives, who all tell me 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they and everyone they know would jump at the chance to partake 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in that concept because something like this has been sorely lacking 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the industry for nearly it's entire history. So in the end, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be at the very least a self sustainable and unique niche site, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire industry.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose features 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be logically implemented over time to create an ever more full 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> featured product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and could be up and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using open source resources was built and successfully tested). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However I need someone who will be able to take it beyond that, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keep it going as new pieces of the puzzle are being implemented and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UGC and a CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> carry them for the long haul. I'm really looking for my long term 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical team/partner(s) to really make this idea and vision happen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think I'm a nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> qualifications and I'll let you know more of the details.
