<PRE>Wow you guys are tough.
MY dislike with VC's isn't even the VC's, but rather the chase to find a VC
- why?
A successful business is one that makes a profit.
Not one that makes a lot of noise.
Profitability and giving ownership to a VC seem to have little if anything
in common.
The biggest upside to a VC partnership is gaining advice and a strong
network - but even that can turn a &quot;venture capital&quot; relationship into
&quot;vulture capital&quot; if you are not careful.

</I>&gt;<i> I have a great big idea too, there are only 2 main competitors.. downfall
</I>&gt;<i> is i do not have the ability to fund the project even though i would do all
</I>&gt;<i> the programming myself there is server admin, front end designer / js guys
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only way I could get this off the ground would be to use a template (i
</I>&gt;<i> refuse to) or get friends to join in the deal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to sell something to someone for 10% of ZERO is not going to work.

</I>&gt;<i> I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for quite a

</I>&gt;<i> time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a real try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful realization
</I>&gt;<i> that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor job of
</I>&gt;<i> bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media industry
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential to solve
</I>&gt;<i> many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and promising
</I>&gt;<i> original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to get their
</I>&gt;<i> lucky break. I think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that this is
</I>&gt;<i> an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and therefore worth
</I>&gt;<i> trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, including
</I>&gt;<i> other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone they
</I>&gt;<i> know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because something
</I>&gt;<i> like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's entire
</I>&gt;<i> history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self sustainable and
</I>&gt;<i> unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire
</I>&gt;<i> industry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose features can
</I>&gt;<i> be logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured
</I>&gt;<i> product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and could be up
</I>&gt;<i> and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source
</I>&gt;<i> resources was built and successfully tested). However I need someone who
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new pieces of the
</I>&gt;<i> puzzle are being implemented and thought up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with UGC and
</I>&gt;<i> a CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them for
</I>&gt;<i> the long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical team/partner(s)
</I>&gt;<i> to really make this idea and vision happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't think I'm
</I>&gt;<i> a nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your qualifications
</I>&gt;<i> and I'll let you know more of the details.
