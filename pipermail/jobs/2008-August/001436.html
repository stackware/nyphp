<PRE>Hope to heck they're using your Euros to pay engineers and not just 
offering them BS &quot;equity shares&quot; which don't pay the bills!!!!!!!

Ooops let's see they're using the &quot;reea.net team&quot; who undoubtedly are 
Indians working for $7 an hour...right?

NEXT!!

&gt;<i> This is a multi-part message in MIME format.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> we work with start-ups from different States from some years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> We invest our work for equity and small amount of money in 5 start-
</I>ups.
&gt;<i> One of the best experience we had with Toby Murdock and Mike Lewis. 
</I>They 
&gt;<i> are  co-founders of www.qloud.com ( search for &quot;MyMUSIC&quot; plug-ins on 
</I>&gt;<i> different social networking sites) was done by us ( they and REEA.net 
</I>&gt;<i> team)for shares and small amount of money at the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> They respect our low rate  and they respect the equity that my new 
</I>media 
&gt;<i> shop had. They were good and find angel investors and VC's after a 
</I>lot 
&gt;<i> of work . Not easy, but we fight together for this ideas even that we 
</I>&gt;<i> work at thousands miles distance.
</I>&gt;<i>  From some months ago  www.qloud.com is part of www.buzznet.com
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We work for other start-up : www.cellit.com and related media 
</I>services 
&gt;<i> in special for radio station.
</I>&gt;<i> We work right now in other two. One of them found the big investor 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> after almost 10months of work and some equity we have the chance to 
</I>&gt;<i> develop it the business for next 2-3 years.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We believe in the dreams of our business partners and we try to share 
</I>&gt;<i> with them our experience and in almost all the situations we 
</I>understood 
&gt;<i> what we must do and how we can recover the investment.
</I>&gt;<i>  From my point of view is more important to be pro-active and to try 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> help the other and to learn how we can do good businesses .
</I>&gt;<i> Of course that we don't invest money in something that don't have a 
</I>&gt;<i> business plan and  a minimum market research, but all the time I will 
</I>&gt;<i> say : &quot;I am interested and let's see if we can make profit and if is 
</I>&gt;<i> possible a big ones.&quot; :)
</I>&gt;<i> I think that big ideas, need big dreamers too .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck to every entrepreneurs !

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a great big idea too, there are only 2 main competitors.. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downfall is i do not have the ability to fund the project even 
</I>though 
&gt;<i> &gt; i would do all the programming myself there is server admin, front 
</I>end 
&gt;<i> &gt; designer / js guys etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only way I could get this off the ground would be to use a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; template (i refuse to) or get friends to join in the deal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to sell something to someone for 10% of ZERO is not going to 
</I>work.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for 
</I>quite 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but 
</I>at 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the same time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less 
</I>than a 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; real try.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; realization that it's probably the only industry that does an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; incredibly poor job of bringing in new people and new ideas. At 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; same time the media industry hasn't changed much even as 
</I>technology 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; has given it the potential to solve many of these issues. The end 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; result is more misses than hits, and promising original talent 
</I>being 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; burned out as they tire out from trying to get their lucky break. 
</I>I 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; this is an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; therefore worth trying at the very least. I've spoken with others 
</I>in 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the industry, including other artists and creatives, who all tell 
</I>me 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that they and everyone they know would jump at the chance to 
</I>partake 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in that concept because something like this has been sorely 
</I>lacking 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in the industry for nearly it's entire history. So in the end, it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; could be at the very least a self sustainable and unique niche 
</I>site, 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire industry.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose 
</I>features 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can be logically implemented over time to create an ever more full 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; featured product. The first iteration of the concept would be 
</I>simple 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and could be up and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using open source resources was built and successfully tested). 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However I need someone who will be able to take it beyond that, 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; keep it going as new pieces of the puzzle are being implemented 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thought up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; UGC and a CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; carry them for the long haul. I'm really looking for my long term 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; technical team/partner(s) to really make this idea and vision 
</I>happen.
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; think I'm a nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with 
</I>your 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; qualifications and I'll let you know more of the details.
