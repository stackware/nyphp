  Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Got a Great Big Idea - Need a Developer/Partner toMake it Happen


  I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for quite a while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but at the same time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a real try.

  I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful realization that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor job of bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media industry hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential to solve many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and promising original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to get their lucky break. I think it's time to change that.

  I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that this is an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and therefore worth trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, including other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone they know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because something like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's entire history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self sustainable and unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire industry.

  It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose features can be logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and could be up and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source resources was built and successfully tested). However I need someone who will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new pieces of the puzzle are being implemented and thought up.



  I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with UGC and a CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them for the long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical team/partner(s) to really make this idea and vision happen.



  So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't think I'm a nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your qualifications and I'll let you know more of the details.
