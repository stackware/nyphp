  This is cruel and inappropriate.  It's more about killing off your competition to build yourself up than it is about providing helpful information.  Barbaric is another word that comes to mind.

    I disagree. This wasn't a former employer complaining about a consultant's work, this was another consultant, a competitor if you will, stating as fact something that no one can possibly double-check. I think it's unfair, and am surprised that, on a list dedicated to helping consultants find jobs, you folks would not be more concerned about it. I think this is the first time I have seen someone in a public forum accuse someone of something and not be called to provide proof of their claims. Very puzzling.

    No one knows what the job requirements were, what the client's expectations were, or what the budget was. Did the client provide enough time and budget to have the job done right, or did they just say, &quot;Get it done for next to nothing,&quot; and then when they realized the short-sidedness of their approach, hire Ben to clean up the mess rather than go back to the developer they low-balled and admit that they didn't give him enough time and $$ to do the job correctly. We don't know. Ben won't even tell the list who the client was or produce evidence of the inferior work. So to my mind, this whole thread is quite unfair to the developer who originally posted his availability and should be dropped.

    Finally, as you read this, please keep in mind that we are a company that  employs people on this list, that's why I subscribe. I have employed developers here in the US and in six other countries. I find *no* geo-political differences in coding skills. We evaluate developers based on samples, client references and their ability to follow directions. I have had more than a few developers who are so focused on developing &quot;great code&quot; that they completely ignore the project specs, budget and time-lines. Those people don't last long, but people who follow directions do.

    Again, without knowing the original assignment that Sundar was given and what went on between he and the client at that time, facts which I doubt even Ben knows, we really can't draw any useful conclusions nor should we try.

    Just my $.02.

      All he did was to provide transparency, now we are discussing the issues. Kristina gave very valid points about the 'delivery of crappy code' and not being able to take action because they are in another country.  


      Another point is that this why we have standards of development practices, these standards shouldn't be compromised they can bend a bit but not break. Sundar needs to seek them out and adhere to them.


      I know it may seem harsh but it may help Sundar down the line in his growth.  As well as protect a small struggling company, thinking they are saving money but  falling into a trap.


      Ben did a good thing.

        I'm sorry Donna, but I disagree.

        It's perfectly fine to express a view about someone's work.

        Of course we make errors in our code, everybody does.  But you can't evaluate experience without examining ones work.

        And employers DO give out this information.  Especially if an individual was let go because of inability.

        Finally, I'm having a problem imagining rows of unemployed PHP coders down and out on skid-row in cardboard boxes, homeless, because their work was criticized.

        Bye,

        Rob

          It's not only unethical to publicly disparage an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to legal action.

          Have you ever made an error while performing your job duties?

          Even a former employer would not give out this type of information.  Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be valid?  

          This is not the same as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business practice.
