This is cruel and inappropriate.  It's more about killing off your  competition to build yourself up than it is about providing helpful  information.  Barbaric is another word that comes to mind.

I disagree. This wasn't a former employer complaining about a  consultant's work, this was another consultant, a competitor if you will,  stating as fact something that no one can possibly double-check. I think  it's unfair, and am surprised that, on a list dedicated to helping  consultants find jobs, you folks would not be more concerned about it. I  think this is the first time I have seen someone in a public forum accuse  someone of something and not be called to provide proof of their claims.  Very puzzling.

No one knows what the job requirements were, what the  client's expectations were, or what the budget was. Did the client provide  enough time and budget to have the job done right, or did they just say,  &quot;Get it done for next to nothing,&quot; and then when they realized the  short-sidedness of their approach, hire Ben to clean up the mess rather than  go back to the developer they low-balled and admit that they didn't give him  enough time and $$ to do the job correctly. We don't know. Ben won't even  tell the list who the client was or produce evidence of the inferior work.  So to my mind, this whole thread is quite unfair to the developer who  originally posted his availability and should be dropped.

Finally, as  you read this, please keep in mind that we are a company that  employs  people on this list, that's why I subscribe. I have employed developers here  in the US and in six other countries. I find *no* geo-political differences  in coding skills. We evaluate developers based on samples, client references  and their ability to follow directions. I have had more than a few  developers who are so focused on developing &quot;great code&quot; that they  completely ignore the project specs, budget and time-lines. Those people  don't last long, but people who follow directions do.

Again, without  knowing the original assignment that Sundar was given and what went on  between he and the client at that time, facts which I doubt even Ben knows,  we really can't draw any useful conclusions nor should we try.

Just  my $.02.

All he did was to provide transparency, now we  are discussing the issues. Kristina gave very valid points about the  'delivery of crappy code' and not being able to take action because they  are in another country.  

Another point is that this why we have standards of development  practices, these standards shouldn't be compromised they can bend a  bit but not break. Sundar needs to seek them out and adhere to them.

I know it may seem harsh but it may help Sundar down the line in his  growth.  As well as protect a small struggling company, thinking they  are saving money but  falling into a trap.

Ben did a good thing.

I'm sorry Donna, but I  disagree.
 
It's perfectly fine to express a  view about someone's work.
 
Of course we make errors in our  code, everybody does.  But you can't evaluate experience without  examining ones work.
 
And employers DO give out this  information.  Especially if an individual was let go because of  inability.
 
Finally, I'm having a problem  imagining rows of unemployed PHP coders down and out on skid-row in  cardboard boxes, homeless, because their work was  criticized.
 
Bye,

It's not only unethical to publicly disparage  an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to  legal action.

Have you ever made an error while performing your  job duties?

Even a former employer would not give out this type  of information.  Do you want to be responsible for someone not  getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your  personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be  valid?  

This is not the same  as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business  practice.

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or
 smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

Be sure to request some source before you work with him.

- Ben
