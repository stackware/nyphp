<PRE>I had a brilliant idea also and that was, as a self employed 
programmer, to build stuff for people with these &quot;great ideas&quot;.

Now, thanks to all these people and their &quot;great ideas&quot; and &quot;low 
budgets&quot;, I have some new great ideas.  Such as being able to go to the 
dentist when I need to go, being able to afford decent food, and being 
able to pay rent on time. 

Full Time Job....here I come!! Cash is king -- it's so true.  I'm done 
posting on this...but it sure did hit a nerve.

&gt;<i> I have 2 great ideas too, one of them there's no competitor and the
</I>&gt;<i> other there are only one competitor, but it's years behind the new web
</I>&gt;<i> tendencies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have all expertise to build each project, BUT my main issue is time.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I work 10h/day in my own company and the rest of my
</I>&gt;<i> available time I help in open source projects (read as Doctrine and
</I>&gt;<i> Symfony). My company job is a fulltime work on a &quot;brilliant idea&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> someone else, that has enough money to build it.
</I>&gt;<i> So, we all have our &quot;brilliant ideas&quot;, but most of us never can make
</I>&gt;<i> it happen. If you have budget to hire someone to build it for you,
</I>&gt;<i> great.... otherwise... define new metas and &quot;create&quot; time to build by
</I>&gt;<i> yourself...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we work with start-ups from different States from some years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We invest our work for equity and small amount of money in 5 start-
</I>ups.
&gt;<i> &gt; One of the best experience we had with Toby Murdock and Mike Lewis. 
</I>They
&gt;<i> &gt; are  co-founders of www.qloud.com ( search for &quot;MyMUSIC&quot; plug-ins on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different social networking sites) was done by us ( they and 
</I>REEA.net
&gt;<i> &gt; team)for shares and small amount of money at the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They respect our low rate  and they respect the equity that my new 
</I>media
&gt;<i> &gt; shop had. They were good and find angel investors and VC's after a 
</I>lot of
&gt;<i> &gt; work . Not easy, but we fight together for this ideas even that we 
</I>work at
&gt;<i> &gt; thousands miles distance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;From some months ago  www.qloud.com is part of www.buzznet.com
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We work for other start-up : www.cellit.com and related media 
</I>services in
&gt;<i> &gt; special for radio station.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We work right now in other two. One of them found the big investor 
</I>and after
&gt;<i> &gt; almost 10months of work and some equity we have the chance to 
</I>develop it the
&gt;<i> &gt; business for next 2-3 years.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We believe in the dreams of our business partners and we try to 
</I>share with
&gt;<i> &gt; them our experience and in almost all the situations we understood 
</I>what we
&gt;<i> &gt; must do and how we can recover the investment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;From my point of view is more important to be pro-active and to 
</I>try to help
&gt;<i> &gt; the other and to learn how we can do good businesses .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course that we don't invest money in something that don't have a 
</I>business
&gt;<i> &gt; plan and  a minimum market research, but all the time I will 
</I>say : &quot;I am
&gt;<i> &gt; interested and let's see if we can make profit and if is possible a 
</I>big
&gt;<i> &gt; ones.&quot; :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that big ideas, need big dreamers too .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good luck to every entrepreneurs !

</I>downfall is
&gt;<i> &gt; i do not have the ability to fund the project even though i would 
</I>do all the
&gt;<i> &gt; programming myself there is server admin, front end designer / js 
</I>guys etc.
&gt;<i> &gt; The only way I could get this off the ground would be to use a 
</I>template (i
&gt;<i> &gt; refuse to) or get friends to join in the deal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to sell something to someone for 10% of ZERO is not going to 
</I>work.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for 
</I>quite a
&gt;<i> &gt; while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but at 
</I>the same
&gt;<i> &gt; time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a real 
</I>try.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful 
</I>realization
&gt;<i> &gt; that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor 
</I>job of
&gt;<i> &gt; bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media 
</I>industry
&gt;<i> &gt; hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential 
</I>to solve
&gt;<i> &gt; many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and 
</I>promising
&gt;<i> &gt; original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to 
</I>get their
&gt;<i> &gt; lucky break. I think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that 
</I>this is
&gt;<i> &gt; an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and 
</I>therefore worth
&gt;<i> &gt; trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, 
</I>including
&gt;<i> &gt; other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone 
</I>they
&gt;<i> &gt; know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because 
</I>something
&gt;<i> &gt; like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's 
</I>entire
&gt;<i> &gt; history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self 
</I>sustainable and
&gt;<i> &gt; unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; industry.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose 
</I>features can be
&gt;<i> &gt; logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and 
</I>could be up
&gt;<i> &gt; and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources was built and successfully tested). However I need 
</I>someone who
&gt;<i> &gt; will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new 
</I>pieces of the
&gt;<i> &gt; puzzle are being implemented and thought up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with 
</I>UGC and a
&gt;<i> &gt; CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them 
</I>for the
&gt;<i> &gt; long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical 
</I>team/partner(s) to
&gt;<i> &gt; really make this idea and vision happen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't 
</I>think I'm a
&gt;<i> &gt; nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your 
</I>qualifications and
&gt;<i> &gt; I'll let you know more of the details.
