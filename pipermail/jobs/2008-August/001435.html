<PRE>I have 2 great ideas too, one of them there's no competitor and the
other there are only one competitor, but it's years behind the new web
tendencies.

I have all expertise to build each project, BUT my main issue is time.
Currently I work 10h/day in my own company and the rest of my
available time I help in open source projects (read as Doctrine and
Symfony). My company job is a fulltime work on a &quot;brilliant idea&quot; of
someone else, that has enough money to build it.
So, we all have our &quot;brilliant ideas&quot;, but most of us never can make
it happen. If you have budget to hire someone to build it for you,
great.... otherwise... define new metas and &quot;create&quot; time to build by
yourself...


Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> we work with start-ups from different States from some years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> We invest our work for equity and small amount of money in 5 start-ups.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the best experience we had with Toby Murdock and Mike Lewis. They
</I>&gt;<i> are  co-founders of www.qloud.com ( search for &quot;MyMUSIC&quot; plug-ins on
</I>&gt;<i> different social networking sites) was done by us ( they and REEA.net
</I>&gt;<i> team)for shares and small amount of money at the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> They respect our low rate  and they respect the equity that my new media
</I>&gt;<i> shop had. They were good and find angel investors and VC's after a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> work . Not easy, but we fight together for this ideas even that we work at
</I>&gt;<i> thousands miles distance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From some months ago  www.qloud.com is part of www.buzznet.com
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We work for other start-up : www.cellit.com and related media services in
</I>&gt;<i> special for radio station.
</I>&gt;<i> We work right now in other two. One of them found the big investor and after
</I>&gt;<i> almost 10months of work and some equity we have the chance to develop it the
</I>&gt;<i> business for next 2-3 years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We believe in the dreams of our business partners and we try to share with
</I>&gt;<i> them our experience and in almost all the situations we understood what we
</I>&gt;<i> must do and how we can recover the investment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From my point of view is more important to be pro-active and to try to help
</I>&gt;<i> the other and to learn how we can do good businesses .
</I>&gt;<i> Of course that we don't invest money in something that don't have a business
</I>&gt;<i> plan and  a minimum market research, but all the time I will say : &quot;I am
</I>&gt;<i> interested and let's see if we can make profit and if is possible a big
</I>&gt;<i> ones.&quot; :)
</I>&gt;<i> I think that big ideas, need big dreamers too .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck to every entrepreneurs !

</I>&gt;<i> I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for quite a
</I>&gt;<i> while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a real try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful realization
</I>&gt;<i> that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor job of
</I>&gt;<i> bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media industry
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential to solve
</I>&gt;<i> many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and promising
</I>&gt;<i> original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to get their
</I>&gt;<i> lucky break. I think it's time to change that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that this is
</I>&gt;<i> an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and therefore worth
</I>&gt;<i> trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, including
</I>&gt;<i> other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone they
</I>&gt;<i> know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because something
</I>&gt;<i> like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's entire
</I>&gt;<i> history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self sustainable and
</I>&gt;<i> unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire
</I>&gt;<i> industry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose features can be
</I>&gt;<i> logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured
</I>&gt;<i> product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and could be up
</I>&gt;<i> and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source
</I>&gt;<i> resources was built and successfully tested). However I need someone who
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new pieces of the
</I>&gt;<i> puzzle are being implemented and thought up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with UGC and a
</I>&gt;<i> CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them for the
</I>&gt;<i> long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical team/partner(s) to
</I>&gt;<i> really make this idea and vision happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't think I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your qualifications and
</I>&gt;<i> I'll let you know more of the details.
