Message-ID: <66dda6c31001091353n7f9246bevfee6cb6c95944dc3@mail.gmail.com>

Joomla ecommerce expert needed.

Our client is building a virtual gifts ecommerce application and wants
to use Joomla (and possibly Virtuemart) as the platform for their
standalone site. Once built, we will port the app to Facebook (which
is our speciality), so the perfect candidate would either guide us to
how we might be able to read-write to the Joomla/Virtuemart database
from our Facebook app or understand how to use Joomla as a CMS for a
Facebook app.

This project is likely to be about 4 weeks and would pay $75/HR
(although we prefer a fixed project price) with opportunity for
ongoing work/upgrades to the platform.

Work would start ASAP and the ideal candidate could work remotely most
of the time, but should be available for regular meetings in
Manhattan.

Qualified candidates, send your resume/credentials to

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] GCN Publishing is looking for full-time Typo3/PHP
	Developers
Message-ID: <4B62112D.4090304@gcnpublishing.com>

GCN Publishing is looking to add at least two Typo3/PHP developers to 
our team during 2010.

We are looking for developers with solid skills, and the ability to 
routinely produce top-quality work. Members of our team deal with a 
combination of trouble-shooting client requests on existing site builds, 
as well as new product launches. We launch an average of 10 to 12 sites 
a year currently, but we expect that number to grow in 2010. As a member 
of our team you will work with our other in-house developers to 
architect the site in Typo3 and integrate our custom-build, PHP-based 
applications into each project. There is also extensive client interaction.

If you are a freelancer or owner of a one- or two-person Typo3 
development shop who is tired of sales and collections and just wants to 
focus on building sites that make customers happy, this might be the 
opportunity for you.

We are based on Norwalk, Connecticut and have a national client base. We 
work exclusively with magazine publishers and business associations that 
publish magazines, so while you will build sites on a variety of topics 
ranging from skin diseases to meat processing, the business goals for 
each site will be similar.

Please send all replies to me via e-mail. All responses will be kept 
strictly confidential.

Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.1001301316390.10640@pluto.atopia.net>

Hi all,

My current contract is expiring soon, so I'm officially back on the job 
market and looking for work.  I currently live in Boston, but have good 
experience working with companies in New York.  I am willing to commute to 
New York for two days every week.  I am open to short term contract, long 
term contract, and (potentially) full time positions.

My skillset is primarily Unix Systems Administration and MySQL Database 
Administration.  I also have good LDAP and LAMP development experience. 
I'm also experienced in software like Apache, Nagios, Cacti, SpamAssassin, 
RT, Amavis, etc.  My *nix of choice is FreeBSD, but I'm also experienced 
in RHEL/CentOS and other Linux flavors.

My latest task included a year-long project to migrate an entire data 
center setup to a new provider and fix daily site outages.  Systems at the 
new data center were setup with common operating system installs, 
centralized syslogging, accounting/authorization with LDAP, and solid 
monitoring (nagios/cacti).  A significant portion of the contract focused 
on implementing better MySQL practices, which included performance tuning, 
cleaning up old data, standardizing application users, auditing table 
types, backups, and replication.

I also spent a lot of time working to clean up the code base, tune the 
webserver configuration, setup proper revision control/code deployment, 
and help implement caching strategies.

My resume can be found here:

Thanks everyone!
