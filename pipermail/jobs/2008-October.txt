Guys,
I am amazed at the quick response, never had this experience before. I
apologize for the confusion, the 2 jobs were meant for the MySQL group.
But I have one that definitely needs PHP that I will be sending out very

am only doing my job here.

I don't write job descriptions for my client. And also there is no need
to get personal here. If you think it is not what you would like to
post, don't post. I don't need to hear anything else other than the fact
that "your job does not qualify for posting".

Ruchita,
 
As a fellow recruiter, I have two helpful hints:
 
First, you should not just send the job description out without at least editing it to try to add some value (or at least not give away the client) and to make the description accessible and appealing.
 
Second, the email does not go to a moderator; it goes to the whole list... it is subject to everyone's criticism and/or response.

Thank you for that insightful reminder, David, it wasn't at all provocative.... and I'm sure it won't prompt 100 more snippy, annoying, pointless emails from this job poster.  Please let this issue die. There is no need to personally attack other recruiters, it doesn't make yourself look any better and it just annoys all of us, because no one really cares.   

 

Thank you.

I don?t write job descriptions for my client. And also there is no need to get personal here. If you think it is not what you would like to post, don?t post. I don?t need to hear anything else other than the fact that ?your job does not qualify for posting?.

Hello, we are looking for php5 and/or MySQL instructors. Teaching experience
is desired although it is not necessary (we can train you to be a trainer)

If you have a penchant for teaching others or would like to do this on a
part-time basis, talk to us.

 

We have upcoming classes (weekdays, weeknights and weekends) and the way it
works is you will be contracted on a class by class basis. This works very
well for people who want short term commitments.

Location-wise, we are based in NYC, but the contract can be anywhere as long
as you are willing to fly. 

 

Compensation is based on your qualifications, but it certainly won't be
$10-20/hour!

 

Note: this posting is not to fill any existing classes, but upcoming ones.
Don't expect immediate contracts as there is a vetting out process, we have
to first make sure you can teach and you have the desired php or mysql
skills first. However, once you are in our system, and complete your first
successful training engagement with us, we would usually want to work with
you on a regular basis. This is definitely not for everyone, you can be a
great developer but not necessarily a good trainer and vice versa.

 

Principals only, we're not looking to contract this out to consulting
companies. Please send your resume to: adam at netcominfo.com

 

Thanks,

Adam Chng

Maybe there should be a separate list for job posting criticism.  What's the 
possible end result of all this -- that someone with a potentially good job 
will become hesitant to post to this list?

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Local full time web developer wanted
Message-ID: <20081006133504.GG29693@panix.com>

Small pet health media company seeks an intermediate-level web developer
for full time work. You'd be working remotely for the time being, but we
require that the candidate be in the New York metro area for occasional
face-to-face meetings, design discussions, and brainstorming sessions. 

What you should have:

     * At least 3 years of web development experience
     * Basic working knowledge of PHP development
     * Basic working knowledge of database (MySQL, in this case) development
     * Basic UNIX/Linux user experience
     * Solid command of HTML and Javascript authoring
     * Solid graphics creation and editing skills 
     * Some experience with version control systems (we use Subversion)
     * Excellent communication skills
     * Experience with Symfony a big plus

Your day to day role will entail adding and maintaining features in
a dynamic, database-driven web site as well as creating and modifying web
pages, CSS, and graphics for the site. You'll work closely with our content
team on a variety of new projects, as well as normal web site enhancements.
As we're a small startup, you should expect to work hard (and occasionally late)
to get things done. 

Individuals only; we're not interested in working through 3rd party
companies. We also do not accept candidates with visa restrictions. 

Salary starts at 70k. Full benefits package.

The Connors Group, an online publisher, is looking for a motivated and

looking for a fast-paced environment with rewarding benefits and good

The ideal candidate will have at least 1 year of full-time development
experience with PHP. An understanding of Web 2.0 technology, database

PHP development experience must include usage of version 5.x and its

queries with multi-table joins. Connors Group in Jersey City is a great
startup-like situation with a clean technology slate and the stability
of an established and successful business.  Recent market turmoil has
increased demand for our products and services, which help traders
exploit market opportunities created by this unprecedented volatility.

These skills are an absolute must:

	PHP5
	MySQL5
	AJAX
	Web 2.0 concepts, dynamic user interfaces
	Subversion (SVN)
	Great English skills
	Used to work with request trackers (i.e. Mantis, BugZilla)
	Used to work driven by English-language specification documents

Experience with Drupal is a plus.

Send your resume with salary history to php at cg3.com for prompt
consideration. Please send online samples of your work along with a
complete resume. Job applicants only, no agencies, no recruiters, no
development firms or offshore/outsource providers.

Applicants should be able to work full-time in our Jersey City office.
We are proud to be an equal-opportunity employer.
