<PRE>Small IT and systems consulting firm in Brooklyn is looking for an 
entry-level PHP programmer (mostly) to work 25-40 hours a week on 
project work. This is an almost full-time job, although it is not 
necessary to be on site every day.

Skillsets we require:

     * You should have at least 1 year of coding PHP
     * You should have at least a passing familiarity with templating 
and the idea of separating business logic from presentation (MVC)
     * You should have some elementary knowledge of SQL and relational 
database usage
     * Working knowledge of other scripting languages is highly 
desirable, but not a deal-breaker.
     * Working knowledge of version control systems (subversion, bazaar, 
mercurial are all good)
     * It is helpful if you are familiar with (and have actually used) 
tools in the &quot;LAMP Stack&quot;.
     * You need at least rudimentary knowledge of modern networking 
(TCP/IP, VPN technologies).
     * You must be able to think on your feet, and you must be able to 
read and follow directions.

We don't expect you to know everything (we certainly don't, ourselves!) 
but we do expect you to come with a willingness to learn and demonstrate 
that you have some knowledge.

The work environment is a small office in southeast Brooklyn. We do not 
require that you work on-site every day, but in the beginning frequent 
meetings in-office will be necessary, so if you're not local to the NYC 
area, this is not going to work. PRINCIPALS ONLY. NO COMPANIES. In case 
you missed it: PRINCIPALS ONLY. NO COMPANIES.

Please provide a cover letter explaining how you feel you fulfill the 
requirements and a resume in plain text or HTML format only. We will not 
open PDFs or MS Word/OpenOffice documents.
