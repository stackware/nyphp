<PRE>Green Map System is currently building OpenGreenMap.org using Drupal, an
open source content management system. We're looking for interns to help
develop this further, building in new features, preparing it for its public
launch this fall and hopefully, staying involved as this project scales up.

Already receiving great press and awards, Open Green Map has tremendous
potential to help hundreds of communities become greener and healthier!

Drupal experience is not necessary - we can teach you that. But you should
be comfortable programming in PHP, and be willing to learn how to work with
Drupal.

He/she must be willing to work in our central office in New York City. We
cannot assist you with visa processes.

Required: send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">greenhouse at greenmap.org</A> with

A resume or note about your background, including

a minimum of a few months experience with PHP
Some example of PHP that you have done yourself, not as part of a group
project JavaScript experience (with examples)
Basic MySQL

Bonus:
Experience with Drupal
Experience with JQuery library
Good understanding of usability
Experience with Google Maps API
Experience with XML/KML/RSS
Managing high traffic websites
CSS

Green Map System is a nonprofit sustainability mapping project that works
with nearly 500 locally-led projects in 53 countries, as seen at
GreenMap.org. By working with us in our East Village office, you will gain
great experience and contribute something very important to a more
sustainable future.  Working with your flexible schedule is not a problem.
Your transit and lunch will
be paid, and depending on experience, possibly more. We look forward to
hearing from you!
