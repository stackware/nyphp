Greetings,

I am at a bit of a loss, trying to find someone to do a tweak on a menu
that involves modifying some CSS and jQuery and integrating an AJAX
function.  The thing is a bit of a mess.  If anyone knows anyone, please
have them get in touch ASAP.  I can pay w/in a week or two as soon as this
client pays very fast when jobs complete.

Thank you kindly.  Kristina

Message-ID: <CAP15A6DUU4xsCPmX+YzAdBWFWWcCHpHPuXpbpet-8tsMB=C00g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm a freelance PHP / WordPress developer based in NYC.  I've got some
great clients and exciting projects on the horizon.  I've also got a great
problem:  I have more work than I can handle.

I'm looking for someone to help with overflow and eventually become a
partner in my business.  You should be passionate about WordPress and web
development, and be able to start with a PSD and turn it into a working
WordPress theme.

WordPress is about 90% of my work, however, I do have projects in other
frameworks (Cake, Kohana) and just pure PHP, so you should have a good
working knowledge of PHP.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please get in touch.

Thanks,

Jon Tascher

*         Must have delivered more than 3 Drupal 7 projects end-to-end and learned all the basic Drupal mistakes already.

*         Be super detail oriented.

*         Be prepared to work very hard on a tight timeframes right from day 1.

*         Understand that we hire 'Engineers' and not 'Developers' and be comfortable with creating solutions to diverse problems.

I'll spare you the long form Rah Rah company stuff and the dribble about how awesome we are.  E.V. is a great place to work for technical folks who like to create good solutions.  We call ourselves the Nerd Marines for good reason and frequently get the projects that have gone off the rails or that other folks just can't get done and we save the day.
