<PRE>Join one of the top online travel media companies and lead us forth
into new products and technologies!

We're looking for a PHP superstar who can design and own a new
platform architecture in an agile environment. We have a number of new
products and services rolling out in 2011 and want you to help us lead
them.  Other developers role are available as well.

(Like non-web platforms? While we're primarily web we're launching on
the ipad and will be doing other mobile apps as well.)



Responsibilities
- Design and own overall architecture across multiple business units
- Develop and maintain (well tested, well documented) code
- Lead and mentor more junior developers
- Keep on top of new technologies and help discover technology based
business opportunities on the web, phones, ipad, and other platforms

Requirements
- Significant experience coding PHP / LAMP
- Experience architecting platforms on the web
- Strong communication skills
- Good leadership abilities, can envision and drive revenue generating projects
- Comfort with *nix environments
- Experience mentoring
- Forward thinking
- Fun attitude, well liked by co-workers (don't underestimate how
important this one is!)

- Strong MySQL skills a big plus
- CakePHP and other framework experience a plus
- Experience with other languages (Ruby, Java, Python) a plus
- Experience with scrum or other agile methodologies a plus
- Well traveled passport is a big plus

Keywords: PHP, MySQL, LAMP, CakePHP, Cake, unix, linux, travel,
software architect, scrum, agile, test driven development (TDD)



About the company
We are a small, profitable travel media company located in midtown
Manhattan. We have all the upside of a startup (casual environment,
agile methodology, rapid launching of new web and mobile products)
combined with the advantages of an established company (profitable,
good brand name, an existing user base to quickly adopt new products).

Every single person in engineering is expected to be a leader. If you
want to be told what to do and code quietly in the corner, we're not
the place for you. Rather we want engineers who say &quot;I've got an
idea&#8230;&quot; and will see that idea from thought through roll-out. Engineers
are expected to keep abreast of new technologies and use them to
develop new products.

Our industry is travel and our employees travel the world, so if you
like traveling you'll enjoy the perks of being an insider.


Compensation
Competitive salary and equity, 401k, health, dental, 3 weeks vacation
