<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Start the new year off right by leaving behind boring, slow moving
companies and hyped-up startups that will burn through funding in six
months. 
 
Bandwidth Productions is a Webby Award winning web development/design
firm led by three talented guys. No politics, no bureaucracy, no dead
weight and plenty of autonomy. Plus we've been profitable since 2001
with a roster of long time, loyal clients. 
 
We're looking for a fourth team member to play a critical role in our
growth. You will develop applications end-to-end for high profile mass
audience websites such as the New York Auto Show (the most popular in
North America) and FIQL.com (a music playlist social network created by
us). 
 
We offer a competitive salary, health/vision/dental benefits, regular
hours and profit sharing (after one year). 
 
Your role: 
 
You will spend 40% of your time building and maintaining custom
applications for our clients. Applications range from full scale content
management systems to complex e-commerce applications and beyond. The
other 60% of your time will be spent developing new applications and
features for FIQL.com, a popular and growing music playlist social
network. FIQL.com is wholly owned, operated and funded by us. 
 
Who you are: 
 
A talented developer with strong expertise in PHP, MySQL, Linux, and
Apache (LAMP). You are a creative thinker who is not afraid to challenge
us or be challenged. You are full of ideas. You are self-motivated and
have experience working with others, especially designers. You love code
and reading about new technologies. You will provide innovative
solutions to problems that we didn't even know existed. Most of all, you
know how to get things done, not just talk a good game! 
 
The following skills are REQUIRED: 
 
- Minimum of 3 solid years building applications in PHP/MYSQL 
- Strong Knowledge of system administration under the LAMP platform 
- Comfort working with existing code bases 
- Experience fine tuning mysql queries for optimal performance 
- Proficiency in HTML, Javascript, DHTML/CSS 
 
The following skills are STRONGLY DESIRED: 
 
- BS in Computer Science or related field 
- Experience with various implementations of XML such as RSS 
- Experience building your own applications using third party APIs. 
- Experience with new technologies such as AJAX and Ruby on Rails 
- Familiarity with Actionscript 
- A love of music and familiarity with digital trends in music 
 
How to apply: 
 
Send resume to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">jobs at bandwidthproductions.com</A> with URLs and/or
descriptions of relevant web applications you've worked on describing
your duties and responsibilities. Please provide your salary history
and/or salary requirements. And it doesn't hurt to tell us a little bit
about yourself. 
 
About the company: 
 
Bandwidth Productions, Inc. is a small, very active web design and
development agency located in Chelsea, NY (26th and 7th). We provide
end-to-end web solutions from design to development to hosting. We also
produce FIQL.com, a popular music playist social network wholly owned
and operated by us. We are small so decisions are made quickly. We have
been around since 2001 and have been profitable from day one.
