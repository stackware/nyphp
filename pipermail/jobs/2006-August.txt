hands on development work. This includes: 
* Web application development using an MVC, struts-like framework
* Database design for new features or new projects 

[Requirements and Qualifications] 

Technologies: 
* PHP (4 and 5) 
* HTML, JavaScript 
* Smarty templates 
* OO design 
* Database design with ERD tools 
* Postgres 7.4/8.x usage 
* PHP as a SOAP client 

Work Experience: 
* 2-5 years experience with database-driven, PHP web application
development 
* At least one year in a lead role (Project Manager, Tech Lead, Sr.
Developer, etc.) 

[Education] 
* Bachelors in Computer Science or equivalent is preferred 
(Comparable experience is acceptable) 

[Other Details] 
Position: full-time, incl. health care, but no 401K 
Location: Midtown, Manhattan, New York City
