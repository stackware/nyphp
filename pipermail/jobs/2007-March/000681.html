<PRE>Short term grunt work that could lead to a long-term interesting
project for the right person.

Brooklyn-based social networking startup needs somebody who can put in
some hours doing code cleanup and debugging for us over the next
month. Because we're pressed for time, we need somebody who fits a
pretty specific skillset - we don't have much time to orient and
train. You'd be finishing off a nearly-complete application in Cake
PHP, working with the lead developer (me) and possibly working
remotely with some other programmers in Chicago. This would be a
contract position.

What we'd like to do is use this opportunity to find somebody who
could be a good long-term fit for us in new york, and who'd be willing
to work for a very small (2 founders + some friends) startup focusing
on building online communities.

In the short term we need somebody who is:
* Expert in PHP/MySQL and knows their way around the Cake framework.
* Competent in Javascript and the Prototype framework.
* Very detail-oriented and meticulous..
* Knows their way around SVN and *nix.

Please send a LINK to a resume/portfolio (attachments will be trashed)
and indicate your favorite text editor.  If you have any kind of
internet presence like a blog, that would be helpful to.

You need to be located in New York City and have enough time to jump
right into this project. It won't be fulltime, but we'd like to have
you around for at least a month. I can probably offload some corporate
freelance hours on you as well if you want to rack up some more
billable hours.

If you've got some big ideas that you'd like to try out, or just have
a hankering to like, help build a distributed social network in Ruby,
we'd be even more intersted in talking to you.  If so please also
include in your cover letter:

* Expereince with Common Lisp, Ruby/Rails, Smalltalk/Seaside, or haXe.
* Your plan for the Apocalypse, should it happen in your lifetime.
* Your favorite web service, application or social network, and why.

</PRE>
