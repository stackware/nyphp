Student or Professional (Part/Full-Time paid position)

Please note that the team is distributed so you could work from anywhere.

The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) at Stanford University, University of
British Columbia, and Simon Fraser University is seeking an experienced PHP
developer to join the team responsible for the world's leading instance of
open source software for the support of academic journals and conferences
that offer readers free access to knowledge and universities in developing
countries opportunities to participate in the global circulation of
knowledge.

The position involves a variety of programming and systems tasks, from
support and documentation to active design, development, testing and
implementation with the PKP software suite. All work will be undertaken in
the context of a larger development team, many of whom will be working at a
variety of locations. PKP has a number of development needs, including the
implementation of a Java-based automated testing tool for use with the PKP
software, as well as PHP development projects. We are open to a variety of
work arrangements, including telecommuting. This is a fixed-term contract
with a probationary period and good potential for continuing work. Salary is
negotiable based on qualifications and experience.

Qualifications include:
- experience with current scripting languages, especially PHP.
- experience with SQL (particularly MySQL and PostgreSQL), Apache, and Linux
server administration.
- knowledge of, or experience with, PKP software (e.g. Open Journal Systems)
or a similar open source project is valuable but not necessary.

Interested PHP developers should send the following:
- a cover letter containing a summary of their experience, and at least two
references;
- a copy of their resume; and
- PHP code samples.
to Brian Owen, Associate University Librarian (<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">brian_owen at sfu.ca</A>).

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) - <A HREF="http://pkp.sfu.ca">http://pkp.sfu.ca</A> - is a federally
funded research initiative at Simon Fraser University, Stanford University,
and the University of British Columbia. PKP was established by Dr. John
Willinsky in 1998. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of
academic research through the development of innovative online environments.
PKP has developed free, open source software for the management, publishing,
and indexing of journals and current conferences. The PKP software suite is
comprised of three modules in production: Open Archives Harvester, Open
Journal Systems, and Open Conference Systems, and two in development:
Lemon8-XML and Open Monograph Press.

The current PKP website - <A HREF="http://pkp.sfu.ca">http://pkp.sfu.ca</A> - provides more information
about the PKP and its open source software including &quot;test drive&quot; versions
of the latter.

This is an opportunity to work on a meaningful, successful and exciting
project and gain experience in open source software development. In addition
to working with developers at other Synergies sites across Canada, there is
an international development community emerging around the PKP software. You
will be joining an enthusiastic and independent team and you will have the
chance to contribute to several different applications.
