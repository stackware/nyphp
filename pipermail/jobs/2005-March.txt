I'd like to mention that not only is Kayra a great person to work
with, and that eFashion has an environment that is rare; but just as
important these jobs are opportunities to get into a business that is
going up and up in their industry. eFashion is making lots of noise,
and I mean good noise ;-)

If you are wanting to get into a company that you will stick around
and experience great things (and success), then I would strongly
recommend eFashion and Kayra as a great opportunity.

Hello, NY PHP

I have a solid 80 hrs. of PHP/HTML/Photoshop work available 
in late March early April.

We have a home-grown templating system - there'd be a couple of
days  of learning curve.  You'd need to work in our office.

If interested, reply to mbiamonte at affinitysolutions.com, with a resume
and some sample links.

Looking for immediate start,

Thanks,

If you know of someone who could use some remote unix admin assistance, feel free to let me know. I'm currently in North Carolina and not yet ready to relocate, but for most of the admin work I can be here as easy as there. 

My skillset includes Linux (Red Hat RHCE) and Solaris. My client list includes enterprise level businesses like the Wall Street Journal and Transamerica.

Hello

Looking for telecommute programming work, by project or by the hour.

I have four years experience with OO PHP/ MySQL programming, and have written numerous scripts and web applications using this
language.  I am also very familiar with perl (5 years),  HTML/CSS (6 years), and javascript/DHTML (4 years), know some C++ from
college degree in Computer Science, and have training in both Unix and Windows environments.  I spend a lot of time on the Linux
command line.  You can see my most advanced work here:  http://spamEater.com/, an email "spam cleaning" web service.  My portfolio
is here: http://cfortune.kics.bc.ca/   Flash and graphics design work is here: http://redstrat.com/

My communication skills are excellent and I answer all messages quickly.  I am very reliable.  For three years I have worked full
time as a freelance telecommute programmer and project director with people from around the world.  My hourly rate is $20-$30 USD.


Chris Fortune,

Message-ID: <2C20E0888739D811975800B0D0F9B8CC60C8FF@DELLDATA>

We would like to post the following listing for a fulltime position. We have
posted before with NYPHP.:

************************************
Title: Chaos is Hot

Insight Out Of Chaos has a fulltime position available for an energetic,
motivated individual seeking a position in a small, dynamic database
marketing company. We manage data for large companies and need additional
web programmers to present this data on the web. Our speciality niche is
loyalty marketing -- and we take the concept into areas where others fear to
tread.

A knowledge of PHP is essential. We interact with MS SQL Server but this
position does not require an extensive knowledge of databasing as all data
is done with Stored Procedures BUT if you know databases, that is a benefit.
You should be well-versed in DHTML, CSS and other basic web-interface
technologies. You get points for knowledge of Browser DOM, XML and MS SQL
Server.

You do not have to be the best nor the greatest -- we are willing to train
the right person -- but you should have a working knowledge of all phases of
web development processes. And you must be willing to work in a demanding
environment where we expect pixels to be aligned and accounts to balance out
to the penny. You WILL be challenged.

Salary range is $48,000 - $60,000 depending on your skill and
qualifications. This position is available now.

Our offices are in the same building as NYPHP, several floors below.

Please contact seth at iooc.com with your resume, an introductory letter and
any other items that you feel will raise our eyebrows.
