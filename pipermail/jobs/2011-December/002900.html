<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Affinitive (www.beaffinitive.com), a Facebook Preferred Developer
Consultant (PDC), is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join
our development team and work on fun, innovative projects in the
social media space leveraging best-of-breed technologies, API's, and
frameworks. This is a full-time, on-site position but we are open to
an initial contract-to-hire arrangement to give us both the chance to
&quot;date&quot; first.
We like to keep things agile and develop iteratively, using
test-driven development and continuous integration. We whiteboard
ideas when possible, versus preparing 50-page detailed specs.
Desired Skills &amp; Experience:

* 4+ years experience working with modern web frameworks, social APIs,
object-oriented PHP and JavaScript, and HTML/css
* Must be comfortable with unit testing, profiling and optimizing
code, databases, and other services for quality, performance, and
scalability
* Knowledge of a &quot;NoSQL&quot; database (MongoDB, CouchDB, etc) as well as
strong relational database knowledge is a big plus
* Experience working in an agency-based environment (interfacing with
non-technical staff and clients) is a HUGE plus

Most importantly, you need to be someone who is innovative,
collaborative, inquisitive, and confident (but not cocky), able to
meet deadlines, and have a 'do whatever it takes' attitude to your
work. We have a great office jukebox, so having a good taste in music
(and desire to play around with Spotify and EchoNest APIs) &#65279;is also a
big plus :)

How to Apply:

Please drop us a line at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">engineer at beaffinitive.com</A> - be sure to
include links to relevant projects and code samples as well as your
GitHub profile (if you have one), and your salary
requirements/availability.

** Know someone who is perfect for this role? We're offering a $1,000
referral bonus! **
