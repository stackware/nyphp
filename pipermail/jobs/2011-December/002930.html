<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am the COO for FitnessTrax, a small startup focused on changing the way
people train for endurance sports. I lead the product development team and
am looking for 2-3 full or part-time PHP/MySQL developers who can work
closely with our existing design team to code new and
expanded functionality for our website (<A HREF="http://runningtrax.com">http://runningtrax.com</A>). Our team
is currently small, giving you the ability to have a big impact on product
development and positioning you to grow with the company.

Our website provides personalized training programs to runners and will be
adding other sports shortly. We are bringing an entirely new way of
training to the sports world and we're looking for developers
who want to help grow the industry and our business. We are poised
for rapid growth as we head into the January launch of our site. We
have two of the top running coaches in the US and a management team in
place. Our first major customer has signed on and will begin using
our services in January. We are pre-revenue, which means the
compensation over the next 3-6 months will be weighted towards equity as we
build
our revenue base. While we are in launch mode we have both full and part
time team members. We will transition from equity based compensation to
paid full time employment in 2012 as the business grows.

You don't need to be a runner to join the team but you do need to have some
consistent time, development skills and a desire to work in a startup
environment.

If you are interested in learning more, please drop me an email.

Cheers,
Gerry Glynn
Chief Operating Officer, FitnessTrax
