My group here at Columbia has two openings.

To see the job postings and apply, please follow these steps:

1) point your browser to 'https://jobs.columbia.edu/'
2) click on 'search open positions' in the left hand navigation
3) under 'department' select 'information technology'
4) in the search results, scroll down 'til you come to:

The first one you'll see is:

"Senior Application Systems Developer (Sundial) | Morningside |

The second one you'll see says:

"Sr. Interactive Application Systems Developer" / Morningside / 02-04-2009 /
Open Until Filled.... "

We really do need both PHP and XSLT for the second position (we'd love it
for the first as well but it might not say so in the ad.)

Columbia is a great place to work and our team is a really good group of
people.

****IF YOU ARE TRULY QUALIFIED**** I strongly encourage you to apply.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <49AFBD8C.70206@reuel.net>

For those of you reviewing potential candidates, can I get some of your 
thoughts on what helps you identify the right person?

Historically I've been told resumes should be 2 pages and no more. 
Recruiters want me to expand mine and one sent me a 7 page sample! Mine 
would be about 4-5 pages if I used a reasonable amount of white space 
and organization. So "What length do you prefer?" is the simple question.

The second one is a bit more open-ended; but is mostly "What formats 
help you understand the applicant quickly and clearly?" That is, cover 
letter first, skills first, experience first, education, or 
accomplishments? Or something totally different?

Probably the more potent question is, "What tells you a candidate is 
passionate about helping your situation?" One manager I had shared that 
he wanted someone who did the same stuff at home as at work. He had a 
good crew and most of us fit that bill. :)

I appreciate your thoughts on this. As a job seeker any help working 
through the market troubles helps.

Message-ID: <ac8ed3c0903050557v44190d27t421fa7bd6766a44c@mail.gmail.com>

What I'm looking for usually when hiring (as a tech lead, not as a
recruiter)

- actual examples of projects worked on (preferably similar in complexity
and technologies with what we use)
- understanding of concepts (OO, best practices, algorithms, ..)
- ability to work well in teams
- willingness and ability to learn

Regarding formats, I like things that are concise but not overly concise.
The resume of an experienced developer HAS to mention the projects they've
worked on (with a summary of what their role was, the technologies used, and
preferably URLs to the site.) So it's a matter of, as Einstein said, keeping
things "as simple as possible but not simpler"

I don't believe in .doc cover letters and I think they are b.s. and
outdated. Instead, you can put in the email that contains your resume, a
short statement about why you're applying. If you're not emailing (e.g. if
you have your resume on a jobs site) just add that info in the objective
section of the resume on the first page.

Best,
Victor

Leam,

In my opinion;   I usually throw out any resume that is more than one page,  unless it was given to me by someone I trust and even then - I am usually more critical of a long resume.  If you make me read multiple pages,  you better have run a country at some point.    I think resumes should be just that, a summary that intrigues the person enough to want to have a meeting.   I have been part of a committee hiring a new CEO at a large company and some of the most impressive resumes I have seen were able to summarize roles where they had grown companies from $10-$50MM, with only a few lines.

I don't think URLs should be on a resume,  they can be part of the 'cover email',   if I am on a subway reading through resumes - I can't click on anything.  I find paper is the best way to sort, make notes on and review resumes.   This is why it is important that it prints well.    I personally think all resumes should be in PDF format so they print well.

About what stands out to me,  it is when they have taken time to research the company and can get on a call cold and still recall details about the company and what we are about.  We want someone who has taken the time to understand the company and the sector well before applying and is not just shooting off their resume to everyone.  We want people who want to be here.    Sometimes we will call someone and ask if it is a good time to talk,  it is a great way to filter out many people as you can gauge a lot with a conversation.   We like seeing other activities the person has been involved with,  like if they helped build a house in a village in a far away continent at one point.  Talking about these points in their lives gives you a lot of insight into what motivates them and what they enjoy.

I also find that, for me, you can cut through the email clutter quickly by snail mailing a copy of your resume (in addition to the email copy).  I appreciate someone who takes the time to get this done and if it presents well,  it is a great way to cut through the PDF clutter.  Or just call the company and ask for a few minutes with the person who would be your boss,  ask them questions about the company and the job and about what decisions led to them toward looking for someone for that role.   You would be surprised how helpful people are when you get them on the phone.  If you really really want to work somewhere,  follow up your emailed by dropping off a printed version of your resume in person and ask for a few minutes with your future boss.  It can't hurt.

Just some thoughts.

Bad advice.

1.  "intrigues the person enough to want to have a meeting".... The person who is going to be intrigued is never going to see the resume. The managers at any organization with your skill set are not the people actually seeing the resume first.  Most of time it's the a vendor manager or HR person who has no idea about technology. They scan for buzz words and if all goes well send it off to the manager. If they don't think its right, the resume will be Dead on Arrival.  Furthermore, nobody wants to waste time.  The last thing anyone wants to do is "wonder" if the person is right only to find  out the person is not correct.  The more relevant information on the resume the better

2. the one page resume is fine for someone with no experience, fresh out of college. If you have experience its complete nonsense. In 10 years of recruiting and placing hundreds of IT candidates I have never submitted a one page resume...ever. CEO example given is an extreme exception that most people will never deal with.

3. URLs without question should be in the resume.  You risk alienating the managers who review resumes on a train but the other 99% of people are opening the resume on a computer. Yes, resumes should print well.

4. Most firms have very clear protocols on setting up interviews and talking to prospective candidates.  Managers are not going to violate those protocols. The advice is not only impractical but it risks making you look odd/desperate. You will stand out but not in a positive. There is an excellent chance it can hurt.   IF you actually know someone, you should call. Otherwise nobody is interested in sticking their neck out for an unknown person.

Bad advice.

1.  "intrigues the person enough to want to have a meeting".... The person who is going to be intrigued is never going to see the resume. The managers at any organization with your skill set are not the people actually seeing the resume first.  Most of time it's the a vendor manager or HR person who has no idea about technology. They scan for buzz words and if all goes well send it off to the manager. If they don't think its right, the resume will be Dead on Arrival.  Furthermore, nobody wants to waste time.  The last thing anyone wants to do is "wonder" if the person is right only to find  out the person is not correct.  The more relevant information on the resume the better

2. the one page resume is fine for someone with no experience, fresh out of college. If you have experience its complete nonsense. In 10 years of recruiting and placing hundreds of IT candidates I have never submitted a one page resume...ever. CEO example given is an extreme exception that most people will never deal with.

3. URLs without question should be in the resume.  You risk alienating the managers who review resumes on a train but the other 99% of people are opening the resume on a computer. Yes, resumes should print well.

4. Most firms have very clear protocols on setting up interviews and talking to prospective candidates.  Managers are not going to violate those protocols. The advice is not only impractical but it risks making you look odd/desperate. You will stand out but not in a positive. There is an excellent chance it can hurt.   IF you actually know someone, you should call. Otherwise nobody is interested in sticking their neck out for an unknown person.

Leam,

In my opinion;   I usually throw out any resume that is more than one page,  unless it was given to me by someone I trust and even then - I am usually more critical of a long resume.  If you make me read multiple pages,  you better have run a country at some point.    I think resumes should be just that, a summary that intrigues the person enough to want to have a meeting.   I have been part of a committee hiring a new CEO at a large company and some of the most impressive resumes I have seen were able to summarize roles where they had grown companies from $10-$50MM, with only a few lines.

I don't think URLs should be on a resume,  they can be part of the 'cover email',   if I am on a subway reading through resumes - I can't click on anything.  I find paper is the best way to sort, make notes on and review resumes.   This is why it is important that it prints well.    I personally think all resumes should be in PDF format so they print well.

About what stands out to me,  it is when they have taken time to research the company and can get on a call cold and still recall details about the company and what we are about.  We want someone who has taken the time to understand the company and the sector well before applying and is not just shooting off their resume to everyone.  We want people who want to be here.    Sometimes we will call someone and ask if it is a good time to talk,  it is a great way to filter out many people as you can gauge a lot with a conversation.   We like seeing other activities the person has been involved with,  like if they helped build a house in a village in a far away continent at one point.  Talking about these points in their lives gives you a lot of insight into what motivates them and what they enjoy.

I also find that, for me, you can cut through the email clutter quickly by snail mailing a copy of your resume (in addition to the email copy).  I appreciate someone who takes the time to get this done and if it presents well,  it is a great way to cut through the PDF clutter.  Or just call the company and ask for a few minutes with the person who would be your boss,  ask them questions about the company and the job and about what decisions led to them toward looking for someone for that role.   You would be surprised how helpful people are when you get them on the phone.  If you really really want to work somewhere,  follow up your emailed by dropping off a printed version of your resume in person and ask for a few minutes with your future boss.  It can't hurt.

Just some thoughts.

For those of you reviewing potential candidates, can I get some of your
thoughts on what helps you identify the right person?

Historically I've been told resumes should be 2 pages and no more.
Recruiters want me to expand mine and one sent me a 7 page sample! Mine
would be about 4-5 pages if I used a reasonable amount of white space
and organization. So "What length do you prefer?" is the simple question.

The second one is a bit more open-ended; but is mostly "What formats
help you understand the applicant quickly and clearly?" That is, cover
letter first, skills first, experience first, education, or
accomplishments? Or something totally different?

Probably the more potent question is, "What tells you a candidate is
passionate about helping your situation?" One manager I had shared that
he wanted someone who did the same stuff at home as at work. He had a
good crew and most of us fit that bill. :)

I appreciate your thoughts on this. As a job seeker any help working
through the market troubles helps.

Somebody who includes an entire multiple-message trail in his reply  
criticizes somebody else for being long-winded?

Anyway, in *my* humble opinion, outside the academic world where you  
need to attach lists of publications and conferences, Larry is  
exactly right.  A resume should be one page.  I know this to be a  
very common expectation among employers.  One page.  That's the  
rule.  You can make a complete portfolio available separately.  A  
resume?  One page.  Violate it at your peril.

What I'm looking for usually when hiring (as a tech lead, not as a recruiter)




- actual examples of projects worked on (preferably similar in complexity and technologies with what we use)

- understanding of concepts (OO, best practices, algorithms, ..)

- ability to work well in teams

- willingness and ability to learn




Regarding formats, I like things that are concise but not overly concise. The resume of an experienced developer HAS to mention the projects they've worked on (with a summary of what their role was, the technologies used, and preferably URLs to the site.) So it's a matter of, as Einstein said, keeping things "as simple as possible but not simpler"




I don't believe in .doc cover letters and I think they are b.s. and outdated. Instead, you can put in the email that contains your resume, a short statement about why you're applying. If you're not emailing (e.g. if you have your resume on a jobs site) just add that info in the objective section of the resume on the first page.




Best,

Victor

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Regarding Larry's Advice / onTechnical Resume
Message-ID: <1236273257.25803@coral.he.net>

With about 10 years' experience in the IT field, most of it 
consulting, my resume is currently about 3 3/4 pages long.  

I use the standard technical resume format, which first enumerates 
my "technical skills", in a list format, which is useful not only to 
paint a general picture of my background but for keyword searches by 
electronic resume scanners.

It then states, directly underneath the list of skills, my educational 
information including degree and date received, and institution 
attended.  Some say that this should be at the end of a resume where a 
person has substantial experience; I disagree, as this is often a 
deciding factor in whether or not a resume is reviewed in detail, and 
therefore should be in front of the person's face on the front page.

I then have one short paragraph, underneath a heading including dates 
of project, for each of my previous projects.  URLs, where available, 
are at the beginning of said paragraph and in Microsoft Word, are 
clickable.  At the end of each paragraph I enumerate "Technologies 
Used" in a short list, italicized to stand out from the rest of the 
text.

I've had good feedback about this resume  -- and am happy to say that 
it garnered an interview at a wonderful organization where I am now 
happily and gainfully employed in a full time role with excellent 
benefits.   I wish you luck in your job search as well!

My $0.02:

The consultant's answer:  It depends.

I keep two forms of my resume... a brief "2 pager" that sums up very briefly
my jobs, skils, projects, education, etc...
And I keep a 4-5 pager beast because frequently enough recruiters will read
the 2-pager and tell me that it's too brief.
I tend to agree that in my wanderings over 10 years, nobody has expected a 1
page resume from me - and more often I get flack of the 2 pager being to
brief.  If you're graduating from college, it should be 1 page... past that,
it's depends.

Last year when I was searching, I got tired of guessing which form was
needed and I often sent both versions.  Probably the better thing to do is
feel out the situation and send the one that is the best match.  Perhaps a
rule of thumb is if it's a highly techy job, send the detailed one... and if
it's a higher-level management job or consulting gig, send the briefer one.

URLs... I don't really think it matters if you put them into the resume or
not.  Most of the apps I have worked on sit behind corporate firewalls or
require logins and I can't release useful URLs to them anyway.  I feel like
if you've worked on an easy-to write website (eg: yahoo.com or
newyorkride.org) and that website IS the company you have worked for then,
sure list the URL.  Otherwise, just describe the project.

My 2 cents, for tech resumes:
3 years experience or less - 1page
Less than 5 - less than 2 pages
5+ 3 pages or less

Anyone who looks at a lot of resumes never makes it past the 3rd page, there just isn't enough time.  Tech changes so fast anyway that something that was done more than 5 years ago is only useful on a resume for background and should be condensed as much as possible.

This is how every resume I send to a client looks format wise:

Summary - 2-3 sentences, basically an opening pitch
Skill Matrix
Experience
Education/Certifications/Publications*/Awards*

*special stuff like this is referred to in the summary briefly, and then in detail at the end

I know you're busy, but you've gotta take 5 minutes right now and watch this video - seriously:

http://ChatToTextNow.com

It's a 5-minute video about a brand new application you can add to your social network page (works now with Facebook and Bebo, and soon MySpace). You just add it to your profile page and your friends can send you a private text message to your cell phone, and you can reply with your cell phone and they'll get it while they're still on your profile page!

It's called Chat To Text.

It's all explained in the video:

The best part is it's already paid for itself and is starting...already...to show serious potential as a second income for me! My commission on this is growing all the time, and you can get in on it too! This is why I'm emailing you!

Let me know what you think - I just added it about 20 days ago and I have over 500 people on my team now... I'm excited!!!

Hi Lisa

 

My name is Richard Mataka, I am a Zend Certified Professional PHP developer
with over 7+ years experience

I have built many complex ecommerce systems, hosting platforms and XML
automation programs.

 

I currently make 95k and would be looking for a considerable jump to move
towards a new opportunity.

In fact the only reason I am replying to this is because of how strong you
opened up your request for a

Developer.

 

If you would like to see most of my work @

http://www.mataka.com

http://www.americashostingnetwork.com

 

I also have misc developments that are not listed. I am more of a hard core
application developer 

Then a front end coder though I do have the skills necessary to excel in
both areas.

 

Also my father is a very dynamic individual, in search for an technical
executive management opportunity, 

If you handle upper level management please let me know, I would like to
send his resume as well

 

 

Thank you for your time.

Atir,

My 2 cents worth, always give your resume out as a PDF.
Never assume people have Word (e.g. .doc), many tech people don't use
Windows for example (yes, office is on Mac, and there are viewers) but don't
assume.

If your document is viewed in a different program, there is no guarantee the
format is as you designed it.

And as one small benefit, people can't easily change or reformat it when in
PDF format.

Ronald

I am physically located and seeking employment in NYC, however, I am
also available for telecommuting and remote projects.

I have also made a posting to joomla at lists.nyphp.org as I am also a
Joomla developer and have extensive experience in it.  Someone else
told me they didn't know of this list on lists.nyphp.org so here it
is.

I am open to what you have.  Please let me know if you have any
projects available.

No problem.  I would have figured about 99% of business professionals
to use some sort of an office product compatible with Microsoft word
documents.  Sorry about the inconvenience.  Here is the resume in PDF
format as well.  Tell you what, I'll even attach a copy in plain text,
hows that?

I've got a client looking for someone affordable for a short, full-time
freelance gig next week.

 

I'm not available next week.

 

Needs to be a php, javascript, css, html person.  Pretty much all around.

 

He's looking for about $25/hour.  But, he pays right after the job is
finished.

 

Email me if you're interested.

Folks,

 

I've gotten most of my business from guru.com and elance.com.

 

I'm surprised how many people have responded to this availability.  All of
my clients have made good via escrow.

 

I've got more work than I can handle.

Let me rephrase:  I?m being offered more work than I currently want.

 

Normally, I?d take this project, but I made a prior commitment.

 

If I hadn?t recently taken I two week break, I?d be doing this other
project.

 

Plus, I?m trying to clear my calendar for a month break to tend to
administrative stuff.

 

Everything, I start to worry for like a day or two looking for work, I pick
up another project.

 

Not to worry though.  I handle my work.

I?ve got more work than I can handle.

 

That's not necessarily a good thing...
