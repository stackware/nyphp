Hi Everyone,

I'm new to this organization and even newer to this list. I'm looking to
recruit a top notch PHP developer for a project with tremendous potential.
I'm working the database backend side of things, but need someone with great
coding skills who can flesh out an exciting ecommerce idea that is now
patent-pending.

If you know PHP and have some samples (portfolio?) of what you've done and
would like to discuss the opportunity, PLEASE do let me know.

Apache, Microsoft MSSQL, PHP, Flash skills are requested.

Please email me at newyorkdiver at gmail.com

Thanks so much,

Jeff

Hi,

 

I worked as an Emergency Medicine Physician for 20 years and had to leave
the field.

 

For the past 3 years, I've been spending most of my day studying PHP and
associated technology.

 

I've done 7 blogs, 2 e-commerce sites, and a scattering of other
programming.

 

I need work.  Does anyone have an opinion of what I could do with my
experience thus far?

 

I'd appreciate any constructive comments.

enterprise-grade internet based application hosting and management

enable our customers to manage their virtual datacenter deployments.  
Of course we would love it if you had a couple years of experience

your resume -- but what we really care about is your ability to  
deliver a top-notch customer portal in a really tight time-frame.  
This means experience working in rapid development environment and  
the knowledge & skill to architect a flexible solution that  
integrates many moving parts.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] AMP application project needs boost - several week
	project
Message-ID: <471EA549.1000906@timegen.com>

I have an AMP-based application project underway for a client in midtown
NY that is going too slowly and needs a rocket boost. I emphasize that
this is an application, not a website, so the developer must be able to
think that way. The first phase is to repair and make work an existing
code base written by a programmer of modest skills. Been there? There
are a couple of others on the project who can help you get up to speed.

There will be a phase 2 which represents an overhaul whose aim is to
make the application a commercial web-based application. It's actually a
killer in a particular industry.

Also you MUST be in the NYC area because you will need to work with
users directly for various reasons, including some handholding once we
go live. I don't mean that you must work at that office, but you must be
able to visit occasionally.

The current phase is fixed-fee, but that fee has some room. I anticipate
3 to 4 weeks elapsed time to nail this, working significant hours per
week. Show me some very strong PHP chops, decent MySQL, application
experience, and reasonable availability! Thanks.
