<PRE>Link Experts is looking for an experienced systems administrator to take responsibility
for a wide range of systems support and development activities.

This position is full-time, onsite in our Manhattan (New York, not Kansas) offices. We are
looking for people with full-time, commercial experience in maintaining Linux systems.
This position represents the opportunity not only to make sure that systems administration
is done right, but to build a department for systems and network architecture and support.

Please respond by email to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at linkexperts.com</A> with your resume in plaintext format
only, (no MSWord, PDF, URLs, etc.), along with a cover letter describing how your skills
and experience match the following:

What you&#8217;ll do:
-	Monitor and maintain the Gentoo-based Linux servers in our office and remote data centers.
-	Monitor and maintain the networks we use.
-	Design new server and network resources.
-	Support the non-Linux desktop resources in our office.
-	Work with vendors to obtain hosting, support and installation resources.
-	Improve the systems administration and support processes by automating and documenting them.
-	Write Perl programs to increase the level of systems automation.
-	Write and maintain programs in Perl where appropriate for the applications development
group.
-	Keep everything running and running well.

Requirements:
- 4+ years hands-on, full-time, commercial experience in Linux system administration, with
responsibility for multiple servers in multiple locations.
- 2+ years of solid experience writing Perl programs.
- Excellent communication skills. This is for real, not just thrown in to make this
posting look impressive. If you can't communicate your ideas and objections clearly and
persuasively, how can anyone learn from all the wonderful things you know?

Desirable:
- Experience leading a team of administrators.
- Experience with the Gentoo Linux distribution.
- Knowledge of LAN/WAN equipment, protocols (BGP, OSPF, etc.) and troubleshooting
- Knowledge of Apache's more interesting features and how they apply to PHP and web
development
- Experience using and administering Subversion
- Knowledge of Microsoft Office applications.
- Experience with Microsoft Windows setup and configuration.
- Not being afraid of telling your boss how their ideas are wrong (if you know how to do
it right).
- Previous contributions to open source projects. We'll encourage and support you in doing
more of that.
