Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Hello PHP NYC
Message-ID: <00ae01c6078d$51553680$0a02a8c0@superioss.com>

I?ve been recruiting in NYC for many years.  My website is www.superiorss.com ? As you can see from that site I specialize in Open Source Recruiting.  Clients are banging down my door for L.A.M.P developers/programmers.  I?ve got more NYC jobs than I can post to this list w/o getting banned for over-posting (trust me; it?s happened before on a different list). 

 

Most of my clients are looking for senior-level candidates, but they?ll look at mid-level too.  

 

If you are interested in a F/T job in New York City, are a US Citizen or green card holder and have significant L.A.M.P skills, send me your resume and salary requirement.  I?ll get you the highest salary possible.  I just finished placing 3 L.A.M.P professionals in Los Angeles in the 100k range (85-115k).

 

I also do relocations too.  If you live in NYC, but want to move somewhere else, I can land serious clients that will relocate you.  I just placed a Los Angeles candidate in Washington D.C. (client paid for everything).

 

So if any of the above sounds good to you, shoot me your resume + salary requirements/locations willing to work.  I have jobs that you don?t know about (stealth clients with deep pockets).  I can usually get 10k more than you want. 

 

Thank you,

Beau Gould
