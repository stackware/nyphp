Affinitive (www.beaffinitive.com), a Facebook Preferred Developer
Consultant (PDC), is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join
our development team and work on fun, innovative projects in the
social media space leveraging best-of-breed technologies, API's, and
frameworks. This is a full-time, on-site position but we are open to
an initial contract-to-hire arrangement to give us both the chance to
"date" first.
We like to keep things agile and develop iteratively, using
test-driven development and continuous integration. We whiteboard
ideas when possible, versus preparing 50-page detailed specs.
Desired Skills & Experience:

* 4+ years experience working with modern web frameworks, social APIs,
object-oriented PHP and JavaScript, and HTML/css
* Must be comfortable with unit testing, profiling and optimizing
code, databases, and other services for quality, performance, and
scalability
* Knowledge of a "NoSQL" database (MongoDB, CouchDB, etc) as well as
strong relational database knowledge is a big plus
* Experience working in an agency-based environment (interfacing with
non-technical staff and clients) is a HUGE plus

Most importantly, you need to be someone who is innovative,
collaborative, inquisitive, and confident (but not cocky), able to
meet deadlines, and have a 'do whatever it takes' attitude to your
work. We have a great office jukebox, so having a good taste in music
(and desire to play around with Spotify and EchoNest APIs) ?is also a
big plus :)

How to Apply:

Please drop us a line at engineer at beaffinitive.com - be sure to
include links to relevant projects and code samples as well as your
GitHub profile (if you have one), and your salary
requirements/availability.

** Know someone who is perfect for this role? We're offering a $1,000
referral bonus! **

Beau,

I don't want to spam this list, so this will be my only reply.

But are you seriously trying to compare his one-time post about a close 
friend looking for work to your recruiting post?  There's a big 
difference.

If you're not making any money off of those three individuals you 
mentioned, and are simply looking for work for them out of the kindness of 
your heart, then please send me their resumes and I'd be glad to take a 
look.

-Matt

Hans owns this list and works very hard for all of us so we can have both
this list and the general PHP list.

I can't even believe someone (someone who spams this list like a Nigerian
looking for suckers) has commented about Hans' very, very sparing use of
his OWN list to post selected items...?

Beau: if you don't see the difference then you should think about a new
career choice.

I've been using this list to post jobs for 6 years.  You can go back to
around April 2006 and see.  Every once in a while, maybe like once a month
I'll let the candidate-seeking community know that I have some candidates
available, so kill me.  This is my job and how I earn a living.  I too have
a couple of mailing lists and/or groups I moderate and have been doing so
for many years: http://tinyurl.com/beauslists - Never once have I complained
or replied back with this petty nonsense, but to each their own.  Some of
you people like to point fingers and make them feel bad like they did
something terribly wrong.  I get 1,000 spam emails every day: Viagra this
and Percoset that.  I simply delete them and move on.  There's a lot of
people on this list that appreciate my job posts and candidate pitches as
well.  I try not to abuse the candidate pitching as I've been doing it
sparingly for a few years too and have gotten away with it.  So that's me
putting in my $0.02 - Hope everyone had a nice holiday and have a happy new
year as well.  

Thank you, 
Beau J. Gould

Hans owns this list and works very hard for all of us so we can have both
this list and the general PHP list.

I can't even believe someone (someone who spams this list like a Nigerian
looking for suckers) has commented about Hans' very, very sparing use of his
OWN list to post selected items...?

Mr. Prevost,

The correct term is, "hear, hear!" It is an abbreviation for "hear, all 
ye good people, hear what this brilliant and eloquent speaker has to say!"

Of course when everything else fails, blame the spelling!

I think they will get to it.  Can I remove this pointless and annoying post from the Internet and my bandwidth utilization? And 1.7 inches of screen space in my mobile phone thus why this reply exists, as I had to click it.

How about we replace the list with IRC? :)

NOOOO!!! Don't delete the Percoset?!!!  Instead, set up some spam filter rules:

1: if message contains Viagra: delete and forward high-priority to jobs at google.com

2: if message contains Percoset, send back auto response saying the pill bounced off of your email server and that it requires Oxycontin.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Startup looking for PHP/MySQL developers
Message-ID: <CAEwGfNGbsnu431BsUYL71anmbPkutwiY4AxRfe0EbJo2R+pTTQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am the COO for FitnessTrax, a small startup focused on changing the way
people train for endurance sports. I lead the product development team and
am looking for 2-3 full or part-time PHP/MySQL developers who can work
closely with our existing design team to code new and
expanded functionality for our website (http://runningtrax.com). Our team
is currently small, giving you the ability to have a big impact on product
development and positioning you to grow with the company.

Our website provides personalized training programs to runners and will be
adding other sports shortly. We are bringing an entirely new way of
training to the sports world and we're looking for developers
who want to help grow the industry and our business. We are poised
for rapid growth as we head into the January launch of our site. We
have two of the top running coaches in the US and a management team in
place. Our first major customer has signed on and will begin using
our services in January. We are pre-revenue, which means the
compensation over the next 3-6 months will be weighted towards equity as we
build
our revenue base. While we are in launch mode we have both full and part
time team members. We will transition from equity based compensation to
paid full time employment in 2012 as the business grows.

You don't need to be a runner to join the team but you do need to have some
consistent time, development skills and a desire to work in a startup
environment.

If you are interested in learning more, please drop me an email.

Cheers,
Gerry Glynn

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] job: NYC - junior or mid-level developer
Message-ID: <4EFDC500.7000601@cisny.com>

Hi All, and happy New Year!

I'm working with a company whose business are all web based - among 
other things a profitable advertising engine.
They are located in the Union Square area of Manhattan.

They are looking for two developers.
Salary depends on experience.
No sponsorships right now.

Casual environment and a serious opportunity for a junior or mid-level 
person to learn and grow as a web developer.

The developer should have 1-4 years web application development 
experience in one of the following:
PHP or C++
Preferably knows Linux.
Must have strong SQL
front end web development in Javascript, HTML, XML, Ajax

Knowledge or light experience with C# and the .net environment is useful 
but not required.

The experience can include internships and employment while in school.

The new hires will be working on projects on any or all of their 
products. Most new development is in PHP and MySQL.
The hiring manager likes to hire people who enjoy coding.

Referrals will be very appreciated.

Best regards,
Arthur Kaye
