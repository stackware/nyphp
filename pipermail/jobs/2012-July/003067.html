<PRE>Hi Folks,
We've recently gotten a boatload more work in and need to shift some of our existing work around to new resources so we can focus some of our old salty dogs on new opportunities.

If you know anyone and refer them in and they get hired and stay more than 90 days we're happy to pay a $1500 referral fee.

We're looking to hire a Technical Project Manager:

*         Must have managed more than 1 $500K project from start to completion in the recent past.

*         Be super detail oriented and ideally have come from a technical background/start in their career.

*         Be prepared to work very hard on a tight timeframes right from day 1.

*         Understand that as a Project Manager at E.V., they are a huge key to our success, and in the face of conflict, pressure and shifting sands, maintain a cool head and positive attitude and bring sense to client driven chaos.

We're looking to hire a Senior Drupal Architect or Senior Drupal Engineer:

*         Serious PHP Mysql kung-fu

*         Has drank the Drupal Kool-Aid and knows the Drupal way of doing things.

*         Must have delivered more than 3 Drupal 7 projects end-to-end and learned all the basic Drupal mistakes already.

*         Be super detail oriented.

*         Be prepared to work very hard on a tight timeframes right from day 1.

*         Understand that we hire 'Engineers' and not 'Developers' and be comfortable with creating solutions to diverse problems.

I'll spare you the long form Rah Rah company stuff and the dribble about how awesome we are.  E.V. is a great place to work for technical folks who like to create good solutions.  We call ourselves the Nerd Marines for good reason and frequently get the projects that have gone off the rails or that other folks just can't get done and we save the day.
