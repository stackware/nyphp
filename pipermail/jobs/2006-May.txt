Greetings All,

A bit off-topic, but I think some of you may be interested in the ethics
of a previous poster.

Recently while we we're trying to fill a position, we reached out to
Beau of open-source-staffing.com. Very quickly we decided that we
open-source-staffing.com could not adequately service our needs.

In response to our posting this morning, Beau sent me a very pleasant
message. Apparently he is HAPPY that we have NOT filled the position
that we inquired about, so he felt the need to remind us about it.

If you need more details, please contact me. I'm a speaker at the NYPHP
conference next month and can tell you about my experience there too.

Top-tier online real estate company seeks experienced developer to join 
a team of 7. This is a growth opportunity at a stable company with 
proven revenues. We have over 25M page views/month and the department is 
doing innovative work on an ongoing basis. Full benefits are included.

The candidate should have 5 years experience although exceptions will be

for a summer internship.

Please include a cover letter indicating your experience and detailing 
specific projects on which you have worked. The successful candidate 
will be an expert in at least one of these disciplines:

* Object Oriented Programming (we use PHP5 but the real goal is OO, not

Please emphasize your experience with one of the skills above; the 
successful candidate will be at an intermediate level in at least 3 of

most qualified. Our team has competence in all of the above.

The successful candidate will also have experience working with teams of

plus.
