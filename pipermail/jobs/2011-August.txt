allowed.  US Citizens or Green Card holders only please. Local candidates
only.  Full company details provided to qualified applicants. Thank you. 

Our client's technical team is growing. They need an experienced programmer
- especially someone who can confidently spend days (and occasional nights)
kicking ass with AJAX and JavaScript frameworks. It helps if you're a lover
of good barbecue, karaoke, and classic internet memes... but this is an
equal opportunity position so if your skills fit, you must submit. Our
client's team has pioneered the most complete system for serious
photographers to run their businesses online. They offer a powerful set of

distribute their photography online, and they're looking for you to help
them shape the next generation product. They've been doing this since 2005
and they're considered one of the photo industry's most exciting brands.

This is an opportunity to join a top notch technical team comprised of
several internet veterans with prior successes and a Chief Scientist named
one of Computerworld's top 40 under 40 (and he's still under 40). It is an
EXPERIENCED ENGINERING position for hardcore coders only.

Requirements: 

* BS/MS in engineering/computer science and significant work experience. 
* Must be able to gather requirements, design, code and test independently
as well as work jointly with the team.

applications.

normalization and design.

methodologies. 
* Strong understanding of software development life-cycle and best
practices.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Chief Technical Officer for KeyWifi,
 an innovative wifi-sharing social startup
Message-ID: <CABtVBogUQVBoYnBujnr9kPwMLRC1ySXyxTRMHhwz=Fp5Wjtg0w@mail.gmail.com>

KeyWifi, a social entrepreneurial startup in the peer-to-peer sharing
space, is looking for a Chief Technical Officer to lead the next phase
of our implementation. Early feedback points to widespread demand for
KeyWifi?s solution, which delivers affordable internet and wifi
roaming: as a result, we are actively seeking a lead technical
resource who can prepare us for the oncoming avalanche of growth.

The leader we need is an innovator and unconventional thinker, someone
ready to challenge long-entrenched powers in the internet services
market. You should be conversant in online security and communication
protocols, notably RADIUS and 802.1x implementations; and with
extensive hands-on experience building user-friendly, reliable
consumer-facing sites. You should be comfortable with implementing
search-engine optimization and payment-system integrations. We built
our current system in Rails but are looking to you to set standards
and architectural direction.

All startups are risky, and we are ready to take a bet on you and your
readiness to take on new responsibility: we will consider both
seasoned CTOs, looking for the opportunity to ?make a difference? in
an exciting startup committed to social change, and also candidates
for whom CTO is a step up in responsibility. PHP is an obvious way
forward both for its scalability and the depth of human resources
available.

As a bootstrapping startup actively raising investment, your main
compensation will be equity until our first round closes. At that time
we expect to pay a salary commensurate with your experience and
potential. We are based in New York, NY and while we prefer candidates
based here, we will consider working with you virtually if the fit is
right.

Please check out www.KeyWifi.com and drop us a line at cto at keywifi.com.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] [JOB] PHP Developer, Philadelphia,
	PA | 45-55/hour (P/T or F/T) - Mostly Telecommute
Message-ID: <018701cc591e$e74bd7a0$b5e386e0$@com>

This is a full time or part time, contract/hourly, part on-site/part
off-site PHP Developer position located near Philadelphia, PA paying $45.00
to $55.00 per hour depending on experience. Local (within 90-miles)
candidates only. US Citizens or Green Card holders only please. Thank you.  

Our Philadelphia-based client is building a software-as-a-service solution
that will let individuals, businesses, non-profits, and government customers
perform tasks more easily than they can today using existing methods. They
are looking for a PHP Developer to join their team and help them move from
their current Alpha-complete product to launch the v1.0 offering. They are
looking for the right candidate to join them full-time or part-time.

GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES: 
As a coder for key product functionality, you'll be working to translate
customer needs into working product. You'll be working with a few other
developers, but you'll primarily be on your own for the functional areas you
own. Even though we're a startup, we do have systems and processes in place
to make our collective lives easier -- operations staff, source code
repository, versioning, bug tracking, project schedules, etc. You'll be
working from complete specs, a complete visual design, and in a fully
fleshed-out development environment.

EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS: 
We're close to launching our beta product, and our development environment
is pretty well defined, so we need people who already have the skills we're
seeking to help us get to market quickly. Generally, we're looking for
someone with:
* 3+ years experience coding successful web applications in PHP; we work in
the Kohana framework (which is derived from and very similar to
CodeIgniter), but as long as you can learn, your framework experience
matters less to us 
* EE, CS, or other engineering degree preferred -- either current students,
recent grads or less recent grads; or equivalent work experience 
* Full understanding of the LAMP stack, and experience with MySQL database
development 
* A passion for correctness and quality; meeting customers' functionality
expectations is critical 
* Experience working with CSS3, HTML5 
* Someone who has demonstrated themselves to be a real self-starter, and
able to pick up new concepts quickly and work independently with little
supervision 
* Passion for maintainable, extensible, and reusable code as well as fast
iteration 

YOU'LL ALSO NEED: 
* a really strong sense of well implemented user experience; we believe the
user experience will define our success and we need an engineer who will
work with our designers and product people 
* confidence in your technical abilities 
* experience coding on your own and as part of a team 
* the ability to scope projects -- you'll need to have scoped a project and
delivered on time (or pretty darn close) against a project plan that you
defined 
* passion and enthusiasm to make the world at least a little bit better 
* a sense of humor -- we are after all, a startup, and sometimes when the
stuff hits the fan -- we all need to be able to laugh about it 

OTHER: 
We're Philadelphia-based, and we're flex-time and telecommuting-friendly.
Our team is flexible as to work hours and location, however we do want you
to be working with us in the office at least 2 days/week. THIS IS FOR A
LOCAL/REGIONAL (WITHIN 90 minutes of Philadelphia) HIRE ONLY. Please do not
respond if you are a remote, outsourced development shop. 

If you are interested in this job, please submit your RESUME and SALARY
requirements to opensourcestaffing|AT|gmail.com

[JOB] Senior PHP Developer, NYC | 110-130k  

 

This is a full time, on-site, salaried Senior PHP Developer position paying
$110,000-$130,000 depending on experience + benefits.  No telecommuting
allowed.  US Citizens or Green Card holders only please. Local candidates
only.  Full company details provided to qualified applicants. Thank you. 

 

Our client's technical team is growing. They need an experienced programmer
- especially someone who can confidently spend days (and occasional nights)
kicking ass with AJAX and JavaScript frameworks. It helps if you're a lover
of good barbecue, karaoke, and classic internet memes... but this is an
equal opportunity position so if your skills fit, you must submit. Our
client's team has pioneered the most complete system for serious
photographers to run their businesses online. They offer a powerful set of
websites and tools that help photographers display, market, sell and
distribute their photography online, and they're looking for you to help
them shape the next generation product. They've been doing this since 2005
and they're considered one of the photo industry's most exciting brands.

 

This is an opportunity to join a top notch technical team comprised of
several internet veterans with prior successes and a Chief Scientist named
one of Computerworld's top 40 under 40 (and he's still under 40). It is an
EXPERIENCED ENGINERING position for hardcore coders only.

 

Requirements: 

 

* BS/MS in engineering/computer science and significant work experience. 

* Must be able to gather requirements, design, code and test independently
as well as work jointly with the team. 

* 3+ years of programming in a scalable production environment.

 

Skills needed: 

 

* Strong knowledge of PHP, Linux, and SQL.

* Design, develop, maintain and optimize secure and scalable multi-tier web
applications. 

* Strong knowledge of databases: stored procedures, triggers, indexes, table
normalization and design. 

* Comfortable with both object oriented and procedural programming
methodologies. 

* Strong understanding of software development life-cycle and best
practices. 

 

If you are interested in this job, please submit your RESUME and SALARY
requirements to opensourcestaffing|AT|gmail.com 

 

Thank you,

Beau J. Gould
