<PRE>Hello everyone, 

 

I hope you had a great New Year. I am currently working on a position
for a client of mine in Roseland, NJ. I realize the majority of you are
likely located in the city but with Roseland being about 20 miles
outside of the city I figured it would be worth getting this information
to you. This is a large client who is in the process of developing a
mobile application. Mobile experience is a plus but is not required they
really just need a strong PHP developer who would be interested in
learning more about mobile applications. 

 

This is a contract to permanent position. I have included a brief
description below but if you are interested in hearing more about this
position please give me a call at 404-897-5152 or send me your resume to

Thanks,

 

Drake
