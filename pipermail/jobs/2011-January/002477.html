<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>We are looking for a senior software engineer with solid server-side programming experience to become a core member of a sharp, dynamic team. AppNexus clients trade on a steady stream of online media through our real-time transactional platform, a distributed system built on top of the AppNexus computing cloud that responds in a few milliseconds to billions of requests each day - 24/7, 365 days a year.

We need an efficient and agile engineer motivated by solving interesting technical challenges and building new applications quickly. Our team is rapidly developing both RESTful APIs and rich user interfaces for our clients and in need of engineers to help take us to the next level.

The position requires a problem solving mindset. The ideal candidate is hands-on and proactive when designing applications, is good at finding simple solutions to complex problems, and is comfortable coding off of a problem statement instead of a formal spec. Our environment is open, collaborative, and encourages learning. We release new code at least once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases reliability), so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and confident in your work. You'll immediately see the results of your work and creativity - as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world at large.

Requirements:

    *    5+ years experience in developing software as a part of a team for production environment
    *   Proficiency in at least one these languages: PHP, Java, Python
    *    Experience with server side application development and scalable web-services, especially REST
    *    Mastery of SQL and experience with MySQL
    *    Experience with open source full-text search engines; sphinx, Lucene etc.
    *    Experience in scaling applications with data sharding and/or caching via memcached, redis etc..
    *    Experience with TDD
    *    Experience in LAMP development and version control
    *    Knows how to weight the trade-offs of using an open-source solution, licensing, or building from scratch
    *    Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24/7 environment

Why AppNexus?

If you're driven, smart, and dynamic, and want to work with other people who fit that same description, look no further. Our team, including our senior leadership, is composed of some of the most respected people in the industry. Our passion for our work carries into our hobbies, ranging from fashion design to break-dancing to sailing. It seems to be no accident that we were named one of the Top 100 Private companies on the East Coast (AlwaysOn), as well as one of New York City's 10 Hottest Tech Startups (amNY). If you think you can keep up, don't worry if you've missed a few bullet points. We want to talk to you!


That still not exciting enough? How about the additional $50 million dollars in funding we just received? <A HREF="http://appnexus.com/news/press-releases.php">http://appnexus.com/news/press-releases.php</A>
