*========================================*



About Us:



TigerTrade is a funded, rapidly growing startup. We are a social enterprise
revolutionizing global trade by offering a trusted partner network that
connects consumer goods manufacturers in Southeast Asia to US and
international buyers. We are headquartered in NYC and with offices in
Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.



About you:



We're looking for a Senior Front End Engineer to own everything related to
"view source". Your semantic HTML, cross-browser compatible CSS and
JavaScript chops are quite exceptional, and you've got strong debugging
abilities across all major browsers. You've worked efficiently in a small
team environment and are comfortable taking the lead in driving the UI and
UX of a web application that reaches industries worldwide.



You've previously led a team and know how to keep code modular, reusable,
clean and loosely coupled across different platforms (web/mobile).



You jump rope with HTTP headers and CDNs, and if possible you have
`build-measure-learn' tattoed somewhere on your body (we're quite fond of
being Lean). You want to work with a small, creative, passionate team of
smart individuals who bring joy and balance to their work and aren't afraid
to actually like the people you work with.



Responsibilities:

?      Play an integral role in designing / implementing the frontend
architecture and tools used in the presentation layer of our stack.

?      Build the user interface for our various web apps (both B2B and
internal)

?      Support multiple platforms (web/mobile) of an international makeup

?      Apply your UI/UX skills to design efficient user experiences (and
test those designs)

?      Apply your strong command of web standards, cross-browser compatible

?      CSS and Javascript to write extensible code

?      Translate concise user stories to functioning specs

?      Participate in code reviews



You have experience with:

?      XHTML & CSS

?      Javascript, AJAX and jQuery

?      Integrating templates in a dynamic-language framework (we use PHP
and Python)

?      Cutting up Photoshop/Fireworks designs

?      Git (it's what we use here) but SVN and a desire to learn Git works
too



Bonus points for:

?      Underscore.js

?      Backbone.js or similar RIA tools and the ability to have a healthy
discussion of appropriateness

?      HTML5 and/or CSS3

?      Lean / Agile software development experience

?      BDD experience (Jasmine,Selenium)

?      SEO best practices

?      Previously having managed a team

?      BS in CS or related field



*Compensation:*



Competitive salary, equity and title based on skills and experience



*How to apply:*

   - Email us your cover letter and r?sum?: techjobs at tigertrade.com

Hey list.

I've got a basic structure laid out in CodeIgniter 2 for a simple accounting program. I'm designing it specifically for HOA/Condo management use to replace QB.. But I'd hate to cubbyhole myself. If any of you out there have a need for something like this, let me know and I'd love to see if I can mesh your requirements with mine.. I'd love to github the source if this turns into something the community can use.

I'd take a look at http://frontaccounting.com/
very well done so far and most likely will exceed your needs and

I've been using it for simple accounting since mid 2010

Agreed.

Joyce, please limit to PHP related postings.

In general for everyone:

-- do not post the same job more than once.

-- job postings should mention specifically the skillsets required, one of
which should be PHP obviously (or at least front-end web development).

-- job postings should be specific and include a full job description; do
not blast us with a listing of possible "jobs"

We want to keep this list a useful resource for everyone; and that means
keeping traffic to a minimum and keeping it concise and non-spammy.

Thank you,

H

Yeah.... Because.... I installed PHP 5.4 yesterday on the *playground*; it
played pretty well........ but yeah;* an infrastructure?!?!?* how OBVIOUSLY
NOT php related. Before I had my PHP in the cloud.... before that i had it
on a server.... which isn't like an infrastructure supported thing or
environment of course ... not....

*point:*
Since no one seems to notice, absolutely ever, and again.. the volatility;
perhaps we could do it in a *big blinking giant red iframe popup window on
the mailman listinfo page .... like a big groupon.. ...... IN * *COMIC
SANS*FONT!?  (the please limit to php jobs only; etc etc; and 'we will
yell at
you')..... hrmmm.....

:).







OBVIOUSLY I AM GOING TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS LIST; IT IS USELESS AND IS
SPAM AT THIS POINT.  THE SPAM IS THE STUFF BELOW; WHICH DOESN'T EVEN
MENTION PHP AT ALL.... OR A JOB
Matt :).

Yeah, seriously, wow... Matt... you just posted three meaningless messages
to the list, defeating the whole purpose of what we're trying to do here.
Including forwarding someone's vacation response to the list...?  WHAT?

I don't get it - why is this list a magnet for trite meaningless posts?  It
doesn't happen on other lists - why this one?  And especially since you're
going to look like an idiot in front of prospective clients/employers.

If it has ever been unclear, let me restate what this list is for:

-- posting of available positions by employers, that relate to PHP
-- posting of specific positions by recruiters that relate to PHP
-- posting of resumes/availability of employment of INDIVIDUALS - do not
advertise here

I'm frankly getting tired of being a list mom for a list that's supposed to
be the most professional and straightforward for seeking work.  Really, it's
dumbfounding.

If it continues, I'll moderate the list, kick people without hesitation, and
possibly disband the list altogether.

If you have something to say about it, suggestions, etc. flame me offlist -
if you do it on the list, you're gone.

Dude.  That Matthew Kaufman was totally massively posting previously.  You 
got all over my case and said nothing to him.

He sent me some kind of whacky email offline.  I have it somewhere.

And, see you are threatening to blacklist people, yet, you claim you didn't 
blacklist me.

And, if I get occasionally unprofessional, it's because I'm old and some 
times in pain.  And, honestly, I used to be totally professional.  But, I 
guess old age has left me a little jaded and obviously bold enough to cross 
the line.

Anyway ...

took you long enough ...

I wouldn't d/c the list.  But, that Matthew has BEEN doing this on the list. 
He scared me a little rambling about hiring someone OR getting a job.  I 
don't know.  Maybe, he's harmless, but I've never met him and don't know him 
from Adam.

 Ecommerce Agency in NYC
Message-ID: <95E113FA5D47164DA096894A17777FB61649D9E2@VA3DIAXVS1A1.RED001.local>

Hi!

I work in HR-- not a recruiting agency-- at Alexander Interactive. We are an ecommerce web design and development agency. We are a non-corporate, fun atmosphere with free bagels on Monday and in-house happy hour (dubbed Hamster Time) on Fridays.

We are searching for senior developers to join our back-end dev team and a Tech Lead for our business unit, Canopy, to be involved in the whole project life cycle.

Developers contribute to all aspects of technology on an engagement, including front and back-end engineering and quality assurance. Some responsibilities will include leading the build of clients' websites and small teams of talented engineers. You will collaborate with front end developers, information architects, business analysts, visual designers and project managers. As it is project based, it is an opportunity to execute tech solutions across different software languages, tools and environments.

Our typical engagement size and the size of our teams makes it possible for all team members to craft and shape the experiences we produce, with the full support of the leads and directors. The flexibility of our process makes for happy clients and the unusual ability to produce exactly the work you envision. Each project will have one Senior Backend Engineer as the lead for all back-end coding and markup integration. If you want to make a real difference on a project, this is your dream role.

Read more: http://www.alexanderinteractive.com/work-here/developer--back-end-development#ixzz1l3rUvWhF

And check out our business unit: http://www.canopycommerce.com/

Please let me know if you or someone you know may be interested.

Thanks!


Sarah

Message-ID: <047b01cce084$05f46770$11dd3650$@zaunere.com>

All,

First, thank you to everyone who provided support and feedback offline.

The general feedback is that moderation is a good idea, at least for now.
And so, this list should now be moderated.

This means some delay in seeing posted messages as it will require myself or
someone else to approve each message.

I could use help in managing the moderation requests.  If you'd be willing
help, please contact me directly.

To understand the types of messages that will be accepted, consider the
messages over the last day.  Those are what this list is for.

Lastly, a general thought on mailman and mailing lists.  They have become
antiquated, and as such I've been working in my spare time on a new online
mailing list system.  When finished, we may provide only a web based form
for submitting jobs.  This would have a number of advantages, though time
will tell.

Thanks all,

H.
