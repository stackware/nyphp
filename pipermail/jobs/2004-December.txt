Hi all,

IPRO, New York's  leading health care quality improvement organization

including FreeBSD, Linux Enterprise Server and Win 2003.  These servers run
Apache, MySQL, RealServer and Windows Media Streaming Services to name
a few.  Our sites run on a forked version of Sitellite (www.sitellite.org).  Our
Web sites are federally funded and, therefore, we are strict about conforming
to Section 508/504 and W3C WAI requirements.

Three staff members support this position.  They are constantly entering,
creating and generally managing the content on the sites, and converting
audio and video.  As Webmaster, you will be directly responsible for:

- Overseeing the sites and content;
- Software and OS patches;
- Publishing from staging to production;
- Scripting Web-based data applications;
- 2nd tier technical support (internal and external);
- Reporting stats and log analysis/trends;
- Ensuring the sites' compliance with various legal and standards compliance;
- Database management;
- Media servers; and
- Other related duties.

The ideal candidate will possess the following:

A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, CIW or equivalent experience managing 
Web sites;
A minimum of 4 yrs. in HTML, XML & CSS-XHTML;
A minimum of 2 yrs. programming experience in PHP/MySQL 3.23;
Knowledge of and/or proficiency in:
- FreeBSD 4.7;
- Linux ES;
- Windows Server 2003;
- Apache 1.3;
- Database design, security and integrity;
- Content accessibility and Web usability;
- Content Management platforms;
- Usage analysis;
- Project management;
- DNS;
- Visual design; and
- Publishing workflow.


Additionally, you will have experience gathering requirements from non-technical staff,
have managed servers and sites for medium-size organizations, can code small apps
proficiently and efficiently, understand content theory and have strong trouble-shooting
skills.

In this highly visible role you must possess excellent communication skills (written and
verbal), strong time management skills and the desire to excel.  If you're a serious,
self-motivated Web professional looking for a challenging role to make a difference to
the health care delivered by our nations' clinicians, this is the opportunity for you.

I know that many people are skeptical to hire a telecommuter however i
will sign any contract you wish to have signed and gurantee up to a

will have no problems extending any contracts.

Pay is negotiable but please note i will not work for minimum wage.  I
