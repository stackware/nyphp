Message-ID: <C0D554B2.61087%jfreeman@efashionsolutions.com>

Hi,

This is not, at present an offer of full-time employment but it *could*
become that in the future.  For now, this is a one-off project.

I am looking for someone who either:

1) really knows their way around Xcart or.

2) really knows their way around PHP5/MySQL5 and Smarty has
ecommerce/shopping cart experience and wants to GET to know their way around
Xcart and its various add-ons.

Rather than get into the details of the project at hand let me just say that
there is an excellent, fulfilling opportunity here for the right person.

Working off-site (off shore even) is probably fine for the right individual.

Please email me something about yourself, your experience, some URLS and how
you contributed... Anything that will show me that you're a very experienced
developer and worker ... How to contact you would be good.. And if you have
specific rates you'd like me to know about include that too.

Thanks!

Joshua

Joshua:

I'm curious about your comments. I was going to use X-Cart, but it was missing
 a few critical features that I needed. Seems like some love it and some hate
it. I would love to use an open source solution, but haven't found one that is
stable enough or has the feature set I need. So far, I have purchase
litecommerce (also offered by the X-Cart company), but have no experience with it.

Best regards,
Cliff Hirsch

areas:

(1) BACKEND DEVELOPER SKILLS:

(1) Proven experience is a must. Please direct us to a PORTFOLIO of your 
work?

Candidates who supply all of the above will be given priority.

More about us: Lime Wire?s offices are located in Tribeca in downtown 
Manhattan. In addition to our extremely competitive salaries, we offer 
excellent benefits, including five weeks of vacation per year. Our

time for a game of poker or a summer party on our garden roofdeck.

Thanks! We look forward to hearing from you.
