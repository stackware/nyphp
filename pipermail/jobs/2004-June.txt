Message-ID: <2C20E0888739D811975800B0D0F9B8CC1E2BC7@DELLDATA>

Hear Ye, Hear Ye!
 
Insight Out Of Chaos, located just floors below where the PHP group normally
meets at 220 East 23rd Street, is seeking an additional, fulltime PHP+SQL
developer.
 
The position requires an in-depth knowledge of PHP, DHTML, Javascript and a
working familiarity of MS SQL SERVER 2000 (Most data-access will be through
pre-defined Stored Procedures.) or, at least, SQL syntax.
 
The work environment here is creative. The environment can be semi-intense
as we are under constant deadlines to enhance and develop an already complex
site, as well as develop news one. Our primary focus is database-marketing
and delivering the data which we manage for national clients, back to those
same clients via the web.
 
Additionally, you should be facile with MS SQL Server 2000, which is our
database of choice. We work in an IIS-based environment with PHP handling
all the fun-stuff.
 
Our company website is NOT the website you will be working on [but check it
out to get a sense of what you can become involved it].
 
Please submit your resume, any links to examples of your work and contact
information to seth at iooc.com <mailto:seth at iooc.com> . No phone calls, please
[A phone call will drop you to the bottom of the list.].
 
We're in a mood to hire. We're growing fast! We need you to help us grow --
and grow with us.

Naviance, Web application developer

Hello, we are seeking a talented web application developer with strong
PHP/MySQL skills for a full-time position. The company is located in
downtown Washington D.C. but we are open to a telecommuting arrangement if
you are in the same time zone and a US citizen.

Responsibilities will include requirements analysis, system architecture,
coding, testing, documentation, and maintenance. Time will be split between
designing new products and maintaining/refactoring code in our existing
product line.

The ideal candidate is someone who has:
Advanced knowledge of PHP and MySQL
Experience with object oriented development and knowledge of design patterns
Experience with data modeling and advanced query design and optimization
Knowledge of HTML, DHTML, CSS and JavaScript
Experience contributing to multi-tier large-scale development projects

Linux system admin skills also a big plus.

About Naviance: We are a leading provider of workflow and data management
tools for K-12 School systems. Our current product is used in over 40 states
and 19 countries and we are preparing to add several new products to our
platform over the next year. We are a small entrepreneurial company and the
environment is fast-paced but flexible and driven by creativity. The
products we build are functionally complex, so they are challenging (which
hopefully for you means fun and satisfying) to design and build.
 
If interested, please send your resume and salary requirements to
shaun.fanning at naviance.com. If you have code samples or urls that
demonstrate the quality of your work, feel free to include them. Thanks!
