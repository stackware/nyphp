<PRE>No Agencies, Third parties or H1-B's.  Thank you...

 

Software Engineer

 

You're highly competent and experienced at designing, implementing, and
delivering reusable and scalable software solutions that suit business
objectives. You're comfortable collaborating with our art director,
strategist, front, back, and middle developers, as well as vendors, QA,
and senior management to determine suitable and viable solutions.

 

A Little Bit About Us

 

Interactive One runs the largest, most active digital African-American
social network, BlackPlanet.com, as well as a network of content blogs
and radio station websites. Our job is to make usable and engaging
products by championing the user experience. We work on large &amp; complex
software, so don't expect much fancy award-show sizzle work. We're
serious business.

 

 

Who We're Looking For 

 

*	Develop and maintain the software powering Interactive One's
properties with a focus on the logic and data tiers
*	Create scalable, reusable, and well-tested software adhering to
department standards

ensure coverage and confidence
*	Measure and optimize the performance of software solutions

*	Contribute in developing reusable standards and libraries with
other software engineers in order to drive technical innovation and
platform initiatives
*	Participate in departmental code-reviews and discussions with
other software engineers 
*	Maintain a current understanding of relevant technologies as
they arise and leverage them in providing innovative solutions

*        Strong understanding of object-oriented programming and
software design

*        Comfortable working in an Agile environment with a strong
understand of software-development methodologies and
software-engineering principles

*        Ability to collaborate in a team environment or work
independently

*        Ability to follow direction and remain open to the ideas of
others

*        Familiarity with Social Networking a plus 

*          Excellent analytical and problem solving skills

 

Required Skills To Stand Out

              

*        3 - 5 years experience developing software for high-traffic,
business-to-consumer websites or distributed applications

*        Expert with PHP or JSP server side technologies 

*        Expert with JavaScript and AJAX client side technologies  

*        You've developed database-driven web-applications using a
mainstream RDBMS such as Oracle or MySQL (or a strong theoretical
foundation)

*        Extensive knowledge of Linux environment 

*        Familiar with design patterns and common re-factoring
techniques

*        Experience with Subversion or CVS control systems

*        B.S. or M.S. Degree in Computer Science or related field or
significant work experience

 

 

Huge Plus If You're

 

*        Experience with jQuery or YUI JavaScript Toolkits

*        Experience with Django or Symfony web-application frameworks

*        Experience with Java, mobile platform development and web
services/service-oriented architecture 

*        Familiarity with WordPress Open Source CMS

 

 

Some of the things we have to offer (besides the usual salary, and
benefit package):

 

*         A chance to work on a lively and vibrant social network

*         We have a really great team of talented, fun and actually nice
folks to work with.

*         We foster a learning culture. We have several weekly reading
groups, we host seminars &amp; meetups, and sometimes we go to conferences.

*         We work in the best city on earth, and we take advantage with
field trips to galleries/museums/events.

*         We have show &amp; tell.

 

If you think you might be up to the challenge and would like to get to
know us better, please email a copy of your resume, a link to your
portfolio, and examples of mobile sites/apps you've designed to:
