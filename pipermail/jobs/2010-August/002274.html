<PRE>*Web Developer (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP)*



Code &amp; Theory is a software design and development company with offices in
NYC and San Francisco. We are a passionate group of individuals that work on
exciting projects for clients who engage in unique and innovative ways to
identify and reach their goals. We are dedicated to making the world better,
with superior thought leadership and innovative interactive experiences &#8211;
and we are driven to make a difference.



*About You:*



You want to wake up in the morning, excited about what the day holds.



You are driven to solve interactive problems, and can operate within an
environment that provides rapid paced challenges, that require a balance of
engineering excellence and speed. You believe in yourself to solve problems
independently &#8211; and as an active member of a passionate technology team.



You don&#8217;t have a &#8220;thin skin&#8221; because you know that any feedback you get is
given with the intent of making you and your work even better. You&#8217;re smart
and competent, but you don&#8217;t have an ego. You understand that communicating
has as much to do with listening as it does with talking.



You can articulate your ideas and solution suggestions; you can listen and
understand that not all solutions are strictly solved with lines of code.
You would like to continually push your knowledge and capabilities in all
areas of code development and welcome the chance to collaborate with other
disciplines such as UX, Graphic Design, Testing and Project Management.



What we consider to be requirements:



&#183;       Knowledge of JavaScript frameworks and remote scripting fundamentals
preferred (jQuery in particular)

&#183;       Knowledge of DOM and DOM functions

&#183;       Solid practical knowledge of CSS

&#183;       Good understanding of and demonstrated ability to utilize XML/JSON
based RESTful APIs and other web services

&#183;       Passion for lighting-quick, cross-browser web interfaces

&#183;       Genuinely excited by the idea of scaling web apps to millions of
users



Send you resume and code samples in your preferred language of choice that
demonstrate your ability to develop practical solutions to difficult
problems. We prefer to see code in such areas as highly interactive
web-based applications, dynamically loaded functionality, heavy JS/DOM
interactions and event-based applications.



Local Candidates Only Please.



No H1 Visa Sponsorship Offered at this time.


Let me know if you are interested!


Cheers - Nicholas
