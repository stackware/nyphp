Message-ID: <177c0a10705100841y3bf2f0acif5425922ba9a37a8@mail.gmail.com>

I am putting together a team to build both a web site and a native
application (OS to be determined) for a digital printer.

Very briefly, the application is to run on the kiosks located physically in
the printer's store. I presume most evolters are familiar with such systems.

The site is to provide the same basic functionality (a subset in reality) as
the kiosk software.

Both systems allow users to upload images, edit them (somewhat) and then
print them on various media with various options. The detailed
specifications of both systems are presently being developed.

The "Job Offer" part is that any interested parties can contact me ASAP with
a letter and resume.  :)

The "Request for Advice" part is that I have been involved solely in web
development for many years now. For whatever reasons, this opportunity has
been presented to me now for application development. If anyone can
recommend to me OFFLINE other resources (lists/forums) where I might be able
to find capable and reliable talent to build the application part, I would
appreciate that.

Thank you,
Fred

A Manhattan-based Private Equity research firm seeks experienced web
developers to build a commercial-quality database-driven website.  A
demo version of the site, assembled by amateurs, is already on the web
(www.pese.com).  We require professional programmers with enough
PHP/MySQL experience to create a commercial/final version of this
website.  We are open to professionals who prefer design/aesthetics
work as well as those who prefer functionality/architecture work, and
we have a need for both.

Payment can be either hourly or fixed bid-based.  Hours can be flexible,
although some time on-site will be required.  We are open to being a
secondary source of income for an interested developer.  The potential
also exists for developers on the team to promote their own web design
services to the eventual users of the website.  We prefer candidates
who are within the tristate area.

Please inquire via email at it at nyprivateequity.com .  Regards,

Steve Estes
Associate, NY Private Equity

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Consulting / Contract Opening
Message-ID: <03e201c79ef4$3db4b3d0$327ba8c0@ERNIE>

A company that I do network administration / infrastructure development is
looking for someone skilled in optimizing their platform, which currently
runs on open source technologies.
 
Specifically they are looking for someone with experience in performance
tuning of MySQL, can monitor and optimize Apache, JBoss and Tomcat, and has
experience working with web applications in an n-tier architecture.
 
This is a consulting gig and no movement would be required, however their
ideal candidate would be located in the Southern New England area, or within
250 miles of Providence, RI (that is where the server environment is
currently hosted, although the company has offices in RI, MN the UK, and
Thailand).
 
Interested parties can fire me an email (jeff.wilhelm at accudata.com) and I
will pass the contacts along to the COO of the other company.
 
Thanks,
Jeff

Hi gang,

I'm working on a client project and need some help - the application
is being coded to the Joomla 1.5 Framework, and will be powering a
website that currently gets more than 30M page views weekly. Things
are going great, but I need help to compress the project plan ;-)

Great experience on high-traffic sites, and great experience working
with the new framework.

What I need is someone with the following skills:

  * PHP Objects and Classes
  * PHP MVC
  * PHP Patterns (factories, observers, and so on)
  * Quick learner
  * Likes working at Broadway and 50th
  * Available really soon now

If you're interested, ping me at the following email address.

Hi Mitch,

I realize this is a long shot because I don't fit your reqs anywhere 
near to a "T". However I am a very competant and productive web 
programmer with lots of OOP experience. You can see this in my open 
source product FormATable - downloadable from my site at 
http://face2interface.com/Products/FormATable.shtml. Also I'm a 
participant of the AJForm project at SourceForge which provides an 
Ajax Form Toolkit using PHP.

If your curiosity is piqued please have a look at my website and 
attached resume. And let me be upfront about my limitations:

- can only work from my home office in Woodstock, NY
- I help homeschool my son, and therefore may need to put in many 
hours flexibly

On the plus side

- am a very quick learner
- have my own local servers available for development work
- my hourly rate is reasonable at $65

Thanks for hearing me out. Good luck with your project.

Marty

part of the job, too.

We're looking to fill this position FULL TIME, but need contract help
