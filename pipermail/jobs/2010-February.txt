Message-ID: <47DDE3AF-C738-44A8-A2F7-EC46CE577379@websitesforthepeople.com>

Hello,

My client is a small independent book store in Berkeley, California  
called University Press Books (universitypressbooks.com). I'm  
currently working on an ecommerce solution for them that involves  
oscommerce.

UPB already sells their books online through Advanced Book Exchange  
(abebooks.com) and a couple of other sites that provide communal  
services for various independent book stores. UPB exports their  
inventory into a .csv file, massages the data into a form that matches  
the requirements of the various websites, and uploads the data to the  
sites. The software they are using to manage their inventory in-house  
is Visual Anthology, which is capable of exporting their inventory as  
a csv file.

What I need is a PHP script that will easily upload UPBs inventory  
into the MySQL database structure provided by oscommerce. There are  
some plugins available that do this, but they're all pretty clunky and  
none of them do the job very gracefully.

I'm happy to provide more information to anyone who is interested.

Thanks,
Jesse

traditional competitors.  The new technology is called "cloud computing"
and is rapidly being adopted across many of Silicon Valley's leading
start-ups and large established companies to reduce large closets and
farms of servers and expensive computers.  This reduces capital investment
required to get a business up and running and permits AdCloud to pass
along the savings to customers and suppliers - operating efficiently and
with a very small staff relative to its competitors.

Message-ID: <553DD9828FBDEB4C832DF50837ED6FAB874E6767C1@EXVMBX016-5.exch016.msoutlookonline.net>

AppNexus is an online advertising technology company with headquarters in Manhattan. We are a dynamic and entrepreneurial company focused on building a game-changing ad and cloud computing platform designed to push our industry to new levels of efficiency and spend. Our team members come from such companies as Yahoo/Right Media, Google/DoubleClick, and Goldman Sachs. The business is thriving, and we are looking for outstanding people to join us.
We are looking for a software engineer with solid object-oriented PHP5, and Web-Services Design experience to become a core member of a sharp, dynamic team. AppNexus clients trade on a steady stream of online media through our real-time transactional platform, a distributed system built on top of the AppNexus computing cloud that responds in a few milliseconds to billions of requests each day - 24/7, 365 days a year.
We need an efficient and agile engineer motivated by solving interesting technical challenges and building new applications quickly. Our team is rapidly developing RESTful APIs four our clients, functionality, and tools for our platform.
The position requires a problem solving mindset as much as it requires strong PHP, API design and scalable and maintainable software development skills. The ideal candidate is hands-on when designing applications and is comfortable coding off of a problem statement instead of a formal spec. Our environment is open, collaborative, and encourages learning. We release new code at least once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases reliability), so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and confident in your work. You'll immediately see the results of your work and creativity - as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world at large.
Requirements
*        2-5 years of production development experience
                                  *        Proficiency in Object Oriented PHP 5, experience working with MVC frameworks
                                 *         Experience with server side application development and web-services, especially REST
                    *         Experience with building large-scale, high-volume web-services
                    *         Proficiency in SQL and experience with MySQL.
*        Experience with writing unit tests within a testing framework
*        Experience in LAMP development and version control
*        Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24/7 environment

For all positions, the compensation package includes a competitive base salary, health, dental, 401k, and vacation time. Interested? Please send a resume and cover letter to careers at appnexus.com<mailto:careers at appnexus.com> or to the email address attached to an individual job posting.

I have 4 positions that I've been asked to help hire for all with
similar characteristics. I'm looking for people that are intelligent,
hardworking, and great developers. If you think you know all there is
to know about the internet and development - I really DON'T want to

You understand hardware and software, systems admin and development
Development should be your strongest skill
You should be able to manage people and negotiate with contractors and vendors
You should be forward thinking and be able to contribute more than
just development
You should be prepared for some long hours - co founding and
entrepreneurship isn't everyone's cup of tea

The companies are:
an online linguistic teaching company
an online facebook game company
an online PR Blog distribution engine
an online group chat / video conf platform

I don't have time for interviews, resumes, or code samples so please
just send a short email about yourself, which field you are interested
in and why you would want to leave your nice steady paying job to work
in a crazy startup. Probably good to include your linkedin profile,

Freelancers Union, a national non-profit organization, represents the needs and concerns of today?s independent workforce through advocacy, information and service. We are passionate about our mission to improve working life for independent workers - a community representing 30% of the U.S workforce. And we?re the people behind all those insurance ads with the beehive that you see on the New York subways.   

We are seeking well-rounded and experienced Web Developers to create and maintain various online products and services.  We work with a diverse set of technologies and our projects span multiple domains - from health insurance to political action.

You should have experience with:
  - Python, Java or PHP5
  - Javascript, HTML, and CSS
  - Database design and SQL    
  - (Obviously!) Developing for the web (working knowledge of HTTP, caching, sessions, etc.)
  - Developing in a Linux environment
  - Administering web servers (specifically Apache or Lighttpd)  


It would be great if you also knew about:
  - Application deployment and maintenance with Make, Maven, setuptools, and simple shell scripts
  - Frameworks like web.py, Django, Restlet, and Spring
  - Back-end queuing/messaging - ActiveMQ
  - Progressive enhancement techniques / graceful degradation  


  Lastly, you'll get special consideration if:
  - you are an electronic toy instrument virtuoso
  - you can make a delicious grilled cheese 
  - you have uncanny accuracy with Nerf weapons  

   

To Apply:  

If we sound like an organization in which you can develop and thrive, please email your resume with a cover letter including salary requirement to: technojob at freelancersunion.org. Resumes without cover letter/salary requirement will not be considered.  

Our offices are located in DUMBO, one stop in Brooklyn off the A, C or F and one block from the East River and Fulton-Ferry State Park.
