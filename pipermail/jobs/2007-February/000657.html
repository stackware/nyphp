Day-Day:

 

We are seeking a candidate who is confident about building and extending 
the backend of a personalization platform for  a site with an 
unparalleled combination of scale and complexity.  

Responsibilities include the following: 
Developing key PHP classes and components for the server side of an AJAX 
platform Considering client, protocol, server, performance and security issues 
during development Contributing creative ideas toward solving platform issues as they crop 
up Designing reusable, object-oriented code that can be redeployed Ensuring robustness and performance goals through unit and performance testing.

 

Right now we are rearchitecting all existing areas of our site using LAMP. Originally the site was built using a combination of SUN/LINUX, Oracle, Perl, a proprietary scripting language and Fatwire which is our current content management system. In addition to the rearchitecture, they are adding on new sections to the site which include Health, Style, T-Online, Business &amp; Technology, Analytics, and we're also doing new work within our Search group. Most likely, you will be involved in new development. 

Count on working on rearchitecture and new development of a high traffic/high performance website.
