Responsibilities include systems analysis with a focus on internal
standards, coding, testing and documentation; determining
specifications; developing, modifying and expanding new and existing
database/application programs; working with the Project Manager to
ensure production deadlines are met; and training junior developers. 

Developers receive minimal supervision and generally work independently

experience
* 4-6 years of work experience and proven proficiency in web and

The Company:
Money-Media is a New York-based media company that focuses primarily on

business-to-business news reports, all of which are driven by
subscription income. Our target markets are readers in corporate
boardrooms and on Wall Street. We are an entrepreneurial group of about
50 people; our company is thriving and growing in spite of the dot.com
shakeout and the lackluster economy in recent years. We are succeeding
because we emphasize initiative, positive thinking, continual
improvement and resiliency.
