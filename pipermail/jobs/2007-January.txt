Message-ID: <018e01c72e97$edd72db0$6501a8c0@MAINCOMP>

Start the new year off right by leaving behind boring, slow moving
companies and hyped-up startups that will burn through funding in six
months. 
 
Bandwidth Productions is a Webby Award winning web development/design
firm led by three talented guys. No politics, no bureaucracy, no dead
weight and plenty of autonomy. Plus we've been profitable since 2001
with a roster of long time, loyal clients. 
 
We're looking for a fourth team member to play a critical role in our
growth. You will develop applications end-to-end for high profile mass
audience websites such as the New York Auto Show (the most popular in
North America) and FIQL.com (a music playlist social network created by
us). 
 
We offer a competitive salary, health/vision/dental benefits, regular
hours and profit sharing (after one year). 
 
Your role: 
 
You will spend 40% of your time building and maintaining custom
applications for our clients. Applications range from full scale content
management systems to complex e-commerce applications and beyond. The
other 60% of your time will be spent developing new applications and
features for FIQL.com, a popular and growing music playlist social
network. FIQL.com is wholly owned, operated and funded by us. 
 
Who you are: 
 
A talented developer with strong expertise in PHP, MySQL, Linux, and
Apache (LAMP). You are a creative thinker who is not afraid to challenge
us or be challenged. You are full of ideas. You are self-motivated and
have experience working with others, especially designers. You love code
and reading about new technologies. You will provide innovative
solutions to problems that we didn't even know existed. Most of all, you
know how to get things done, not just talk a good game! 
 
The following skills are REQUIRED: 
 
- Minimum of 3 solid years building applications in PHP/MYSQL 
- Strong Knowledge of system administration under the LAMP platform 
- Comfort working with existing code bases 
- Experience fine tuning mysql queries for optimal performance 
- Proficiency in HTML, Javascript, DHTML/CSS 
 
The following skills are STRONGLY DESIRED: 
 
- BS in Computer Science or related field 
- Experience with various implementations of XML such as RSS 
- Experience building your own applications using third party APIs. 
- Experience with new technologies such as AJAX and Ruby on Rails 
- Familiarity with Actionscript 
- A love of music and familiarity with digital trends in music 
 
How to apply: 
 
Send resume to jobs at bandwidthproductions.com with URLs and/or
descriptions of relevant web applications you've worked on describing
your duties and responsibilities. Please provide your salary history
and/or salary requirements. And it doesn't hurt to tell us a little bit
about yourself. 
 
About the company: 
 
Bandwidth Productions, Inc. is a small, very active web design and
development agency located in Chelsea, NY (26th and 7th). We provide
end-to-end web solutions from design to development to hosting. We also
produce FIQL.com, a popular music playist social network wholly owned

Very small Manhattan company sick of doing our own web stuff :)

Looking for a designer/dev that geeks out on one of the popular free CMS's
- we like Typo3, but we're open to suggestions - to create a basic CMS
and a mild site redesign (in other words, you'll have to work within
the constraints of an existing company identity to a large degree).

The successful candidate will have a number of successful sites
implemented in the target CMS that we can tour. We'd love to see, if
possible, how you integrate a WYSIWYGish editor with your style
sheets, and how you implemented a basic editorial approval workflow.

We've worked with indy designers and programmers before, and we're
pretty easy clients (or so we've  been told). We pay our bills
promptly, and we have references to back that up, FYI.

Please send responses to jonnyh at gmail.com with the word CMSJOB in the
subject line.

Thanks.

I'm looking for a business partner, CTO and programmer?all rolled into one. Is this you?
 
I want to bring a niche b-2-b social networking project off the back burner and launch it in the next 2-4 months. Can you help? It is a chance for ownership participation in an innovative project with strong commercial appeal.
 
You (a person or a couple of people) will need to think like a CTO and program like a god. You will need to combine some serious programming and architecting skills. The site has been programmed in LAMP and is quite large and complex. Although it is probably 90% complete, there is still lots to do. You will need to be a first rate, object-oriented PHP programmer, with excellent mySQL knowledge and additional strength in JavaScript and CSS.
 
You will need good project management skills, teamwork and excellent communication skills. And of course, you will need to think and work like an owner. There is no salary, hourly wage or project fee for this. You build part of it, you own part of it. And our small team will bring it to market profitably together.
 
If this project is a success for us, it will form the foundation of a second project (also on the back burner and also well underway) with even greater potential for the second half of the year.
 
Part-time is fine. Moonlighting from a bigger job is fine. (Even a student team might be okay.) You simply must be able to get the job done well--to the highest standards--and on schedule.
 
If you are interested, reply with a resume and description of your relevant skills and experience. Also tell me how much time you will be able to devote to this project and where you are located. Include an email address and a phone number.

No, this isn't a personal ad ;-)

I have a client in mid-town that is looking for a Drupaloid for a
4-month commitment, with the possibility of going FTE at the end.

They are looking for someone with professional experience, this will
