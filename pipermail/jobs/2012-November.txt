Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Looking for a mid-level PHP developer.
Message-ID: <CAGp5=_35ce1G6Q6TLCTy3ofHE-kQqVH3VQ-HwxpzDyd-jO+iZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to preface this by saying I am NOT a recruiter and NOT in HR,
I will personally be involved in the interviewing/hiring for this position.

I am looking for a mid-level PHP developer.

The candidate should also have good RDMS skills (Postgresql would be nice).

Javascript and JQuery experience is also required.

A large portion of the code that you would be working on is a fairly
complicated MVC based web application
that handles ticketing, inventory, domain management, and accounting.

The framework is a homegrown, in-house solution however knowledge of at
least one existing PHP framework
would probably be helpful (Zen, Symfony, etc.).

We are also responsible for some Perl and Python applications as well as a
customized CloudStack application.

I really want someone who is willing to learn and enjoys working as part of
a team. One of the great things
about working here is that you will interact with the people that use your
code on a daily basis and you will
be able to see how your work makes their jobs easier. Even though we use
open source web development tools, we
don't build websites, rather we build and maintain infrastructure and
business applications. If you have
business applications development in your background it would be a plus.

The company is a small managed hosting company (50 employees) located in
Soho NYC. Salary would depend on experience.

This is a full-time salaried position.

No contractors or recruiters please.

Please reply to lw-dev at logicworks.net if you are interested.

Lead Software Engineer

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Attention NYC Recruiters with PHP openings!
Message-ID: <739738329.1353535285269.JavaMail.cfservice@sl11app2>


Hi there, and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!  Lately, I've gotten the feeling that this list has more tech recruiters than actual php developers subscribing to it -- so here's hoping I'm reaching my target audience.

 

I have two excellent developer candidates that I'm trying to place in NYC and thought I'd investigate whether anyone knew of a position that could be a fit.  If you're an in-house recruiter who is open to working with an agency, please get in touch with me.  Or, if you're an agency-recruiter that could benefit from sharing your job openings, I'm open to partnering with you if you'd like to collaborate on your search.

 

My first candidate is a Wordpress/PHP developer w/ experience with name brand, high-traffic ad-serving sites, between 3-4 years experience (all in PHP), great personality.  

 

My second candidate has a CS degree from a top school, strong developer background (Java),  newer to PHP , also a great personality.  

 

Casual company culture / work-life balance is very important to these candidates. If you have something interesting to share please let me know.  The PHP opportunities that I'm working on at the moment require strong OO PHP programming and would not be a fit for these candidates, but I'd like to try to help them. 

 

(Note:  If you're an OO PHP developer and actually reading this, and you're thinking about changing jobs after the holidays - get in touch with me!)

 

Best regards,
