NPower (www.npower.org<http://www.npower.org>) is a nonprofit technology organization serving other nonprofit organizations. We are in need of a skilled PHP programmer on a paid, subcontractor basis to perform a code audit and potentially partner for future development/

The audit is of a custom built community site for a national nonprofit who places college students in local highschools to teach health education courses. The community site handles recruitment, scheduling, reports, etc. Though the site meets functional requirements, the performance has been unsatisfactory and we are looking for a code audit to help identify weaknesses. This project may also lead to a major upgrade and rebuild project in the future.

Please contact Rick Rose at rick.rose at npowerny.org<mailto:rick.rose at npowerny.org> if you are interested or can recommend someone for this project.

The Hotlist is a player in the social networking and geolocal space,

We have a practical approach to development, while still working near 
the bleeding edge -- definitely a good place to learn new techniques, 
and help us solve modern programming, design, and architecture problems.

We're looking for a talented and moderately experienced LAMP developer 
to join our growing team and help continue to develop our web and mobile 
applications.  We're located in a great incubator space in Soho, and are 
looking for full-time on-site developers.

Responsibilities
The focus of this position is on the Model, Controller, Data storage 
strategy and batch processing (i.e. backend) of our application stack.
Develop and deploy our PHP-based application.
Design, modify, and deploy MySQL-based datastores.
Work as part of our team to enhance the scalability, availability, and 
functionality of our platform.
Experience
3+ years professional PHP web application development with a MVC framework
3+ years professional SQL experience (MySQL a plus)
3+ years professional Linux experience
Experience analysing and measuring site performance a plus.
MySQL clustering and/or highly scalable non-SQL data storage/processing 
a plus.
MySQL high-availability solutions a plus.
Experience with facebook connect, mobile applications, geolocation a big 
plus.
Skills
PHP
MySQL
Perl a plus.
Analytic and detail-oriented.
Self-motivated and focused.
Education
BS degree in computer science or equivalent
Compensation
Competitive salary plus early-stage stock options.

Hi Folks -

	I'm a freelance developer with more work than I can handle over  
coming weeks.

	I'm looking for a counterpart to help take some things off my plate.   
Ideally, I keep getting more work than I can handle, and keep carving  
off good chunks for you indefinitely.

	Minimum requirements:

		- Strong programming skills (at least a couple of years of  
development experience, and you enjoy developing)
		- A good handle on PHP.
		- SQL (mySQL in particular)
		- Front-end competency (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
		- Familiarity with Subversion
		- Near-term availability
		- Good written and verbal communication skills

	Big Plusses:

		- Zend Framework Experience
		- Doctrine ORM experience
		- Experience with the ExtJS library
		- Geographic proximity to Midtown and/or DUMBO				
		- No Full-Time Job

	Ideally, this turns into a long-term flow of work.  Aside from pay,  
you'll get to work with an experienced developer who you can lean on  
if you're stuck, and who will completely isolate from end-client BS.

	I don't particularly care where you are, so long as you're generally  
available to email/IM/phone from around noon to seven NY time. That  
said, the potential for some face time is a definite plus, as is the  
ability to actually be working during those hours.

	If you're a solid freelance developer in need of some regular work,  
please email me at jobs at timdev.com, tell me a bit about yourself, and  
let me know what kind of hourly rate you're looking for.

-Tim

Hello everyone,

 

I'm recruiting a LAMP Engineer for a small, well-funded 8-person startup in downtown Manhattan.  At least 3 years of professional experience (PHP/MySQL development) is required for consideration. 

 

This is a chance to get in on the ground floor of a promising tech startup.  Base salaries will be in the range of 85K, but will include a substantial equity component upon successful completion upon your first two months of employment. 

 

Just a couple of weeks ago they raised three-quarters of a million dollars from angel investors.  They've got a cool office space in SoHo, and are looking for someone who doesn't mind putting in typical "startup" hours. This is a fun, cohesive group that likes to joke around, but works hard to get stuff done. You will be expected to work hard, but you will LOVE every minute of it.

 

Qualified candidates:  Please email me your resume, in confidence.  A response will be provided within 24 hours.

 

Best regards,













Sue Fehser, Esq.


President & Co-Founder

 Hi, I am happy to announce that we have two openings posted on our jobs
website.  We are the Interactive Services group in Columbia University
Information Technology.  We design, build and maintain websites for schools,
departments, labs, institutes, clubs, groups, projects and individuals.
MOST of this we do using Drupal though there IS a legacy CMS system still in
use for some sites called HyperContent written in Java.

Requirements for both positions are:

That you are first and foremost a developer, not a designer.
Demonstrable PHP/MySQL website development experience.
Demonstrable Drupal experience.
Demonstrable CSS/Javascript experience (esp. jquery)

If you know XSLT and Java that's ALL TO THE GOOD.

Finally, any HTML5, CSS3 and/or iPhone development experience is a huge
plus!

Please don't write me to express interest in the positions. If you're
interested, please head over to these links, read the descriptions and apply
if you are moved to do so.  Once you have completed your application, by all
means, send me email to give me a heads up about your application.

Etsy is currently hiring engineers with experience in various languages
including PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, Objective C, and Scala.  Rather than
posting details of all of these positions, I'll include one aspect of job
descriptions that I think is representative:

 --> "You have in-depth knowledge of scale and what it takes to be
successful at a community-driven web site where the word 'millions' is used
frequently and in many contexts."

We have many roles open right now in both New York City and San Francisco.
You can find details about these at our jobs site, or you can contact me
directly to hear more.

http://www.etsy.com/jobs/

Additionally, we're hosting a talk tonight by Fred Brooks, author of the
legendary book on software engineering and process, "The Mythical Man
Month".  The event is free and open to the public, hosted at Etsy's office
in DUMBO (Brooklyn).

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Freelance PHP/Front End And Server Admin Wanted
Message-ID: <AANLkTil7p2_awx0C0SW218uc1UI2JczXD4BepU5ugx5C@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I recently joined a fantastic little company in Dumbo, Brooklyn. We
are seeking local freelancers for the roles listed below. Salary will
be market rate, commensurate with experience. Benefits include:
payment every Monday, relaxed working environment, some telecommuting
possible.?If you are seeking to supplement other employment (like a
9-5 gig or freelance clients) we can work with you to accommodate
scheduling. If you would like more information, email me at
dumbo.php at gmail.com and I will tell you more about our company and
these positions. Send resume with samples of prior work (code samples,
etc.) I'm looking to set up interviews for this Wednesday and
Thursday.

1. Intermediate to Advanced level front end/php developer. Familiarity
with OS Commerce and Magento is ideal. We have some relatively small
jobs that need attention asap, such as certain front end updates. We
also need to evaluate our current website code, so we can decide
whether to optimize the current site or rebuild from scratch. This
would ideally lead into larger projects and a more permanent role with
our company.?Excellent communication skills are a plus. We would
initially work on a pay-as-you-go basis, where you would be paid by
the hour or by the project.

2. Lead Linux Server Admin.
We're looking for someone we can contact with reasonable notice (and
possibly emergencies) via email, phone?or IM and ask to do a job on
the server. This work would ideally be done on an hourly basis. You
will also be responsible for ongoing maintenance of the server, in
exchange for a monthly retainer fee.?If you're interested, shoot me
and email and let's discuss the nitty gritty details.

Local to Brooklyn is ideal but any qualified tri-state areas
candidates will be welcomed. No firms please, no recruiters.

Thank you,

Beth Stevens
