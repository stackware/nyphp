Hi all, I just posted a short Drupal Module gig on eLance, you can check
it out at https://secure.elance.com/c/rfp/main/rfpBid.pl?jobid=13017851
<https://secure.elance.com/c/rfp/main/rfpBid.pl?jobid=13017851&catId=102
24> &catId=10224
 
Feel free to contact me directly, I never used eLance before and it
doesn't seem to be working to well.
 
Short story: modify/extend two contrib modules for Drupal. If you have a
good knowledge of Drupal, this could be a quick job before the holidays
hit. I'm guessing 20 -30 hours.
 
Cheers,
 
Jaz
