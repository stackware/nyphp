<PRE>
Exciting Startup in Manhattan seeking a sharp, highly experienced, and self-directed PHP Developer / Team Lead!

 

Are you tired of working for a big corporation that doesn't encourage your innate technical creativity, and fails to reward your hard work? Join a fun, young group of men and women who have co-founded a successful startup based in Manhattan, that is already producing revenue. Since we are not yet &quot;profitable,&quot; we are looking to pay in the range of 30-50K base (depending upon experience), supplemented by a very large and substantial equity interest in this company (approx 5%). Ideal candidates will know how to build a scalable, secure website, with a creative streak to think up new functionality for our web product. The work hours are intense, but so is the payoff in the end.  Exceptional communication and leadership skills are a must, as you must lead the web development as we continue to grow. As the sole PHP Developer, you work well on your own, and have the confidence and technical experience to build up a team.  


 

QUALIFICATIONS
- Extensive OOP PHP and MySQL programming capabilities REQUIRED

- Comfort with CSS and HTML/XHTML

- Drupal CMS a plus

- Knowledge of AJAX, JavaScript, XML is a plus

- Authorization to work in US with any employer (Sorry, sponsorship is not available)

- B.S. in Computer Science

- 4+ years professional experience. Will consider 0-4 years experience if you have been coding since you were a kid, and have solid internship experience or equivalent background.

 

Benefits include Tuition Reimbursement!  Please send a resume and brief cover letter to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">sfehser at winterwyman.com.</A>  Potential candidates will be selected based upon skills and experience, as well as enthusiasm and the ability to articulate why you'd be the perfect candidate for this small and unique startup!
