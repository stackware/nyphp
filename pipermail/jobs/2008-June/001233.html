<PRE>-Summary-
&#160; 
You'll work closely with other developers throughout the requirements, design, and implementation phases of web-based front-end projects. Ideally, you'll offer copious amounts of object-oriented PHP experience (framework independent) in a LAMP environment which will include JavaScript, XML/XSLT, CSS, and SQL experience. Naturally since we all have to get along, you're also a great communicator with techies and non-techies. 


-Us-

GridApp Systems really is the leading developer of database management automation software (<A HREF="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Database/GridApp-Takes-ModelDriven-Approach-to-Database-Automation/">http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Database/GridApp-Takes-ModelDriven-Approach-to-Database-Automation/</A>). The front-end of Clarity is heavy on object-oriented PHP while the server side focuses on object-oriented Perl 5.8.7. We're very programmer casual and team-oriented. Our CEO was previously a CTO and brought with him several of his trusted cohorts when they started GridApp. We are both venture funded and profitable.


-Responsibilities-

Work effectively with product management and technical leads to understand and define requirements

Create written design specifications, which ensure that the software fits into our overall scalable architecture, addresses requirements, and is testable

Code in PHP and JavaScript applying object oriented development principles, cleanly separating logic from content

Provide and then meet time commitments for development projects

Communicate status and issues orally and in writing in a timely manner


-Minimum qualifications-

5+ years experience with PHP writing robust software systems

3+ years experience with JavaScript/AJAX; XML/XSLT; SQL; CSS

Bonus points for PostgreSQL, Smarty templates

Very strong understanding of object oriented systems and UI design principles is required

Familiarity with major databases (Oracle, MS SQL Server) is a plus.

Excellent written and oral communications skills are required

Thrive in a deadline-driven, fast-paced team environment

College degree isn't required since so many of our developers have their PhD from the School of Hard Knocks
