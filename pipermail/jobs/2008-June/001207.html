<PRE>Dear David,

 

I am Vaughn Frost - over 30 years of I.T. experience.  My background spans
multiple companies and multiple engagements both in the United States and
around the world.  Currently, I work from home for a fortune 500 company
performing data architecture services.  While I do not reside in the NYC
area; I do work from home and have the capability for internet meetings and
unlimited phone contact.  Note that in my current full-time job, I perform
Data Architecture work I work from home allowing for meetings with business
owners, logical data modeling, validation, creation of data schemas,
loading, testing, etc.

 

To attempt to identify where I would match your needs, I perform Business
Analysis to glean logical data structures.  I do this via the Erwin data
modeling toolset.  Once the key logical concepts are determined and
validated (to the business rules/requirements), I create the MySQL design
based upon those business rules and other underlying data architecture
concepts.  With that completed, the process of designing the application
begins.  The concept is to follow the DBMS structures with the application
code to create a system that encompasses all current business needs with an
eye on growth potential.  That potential being available in a DBMS that is
properly designed to accommodate such growth without costly application code
re-writes.

 

I have worked extensively to develop a recent Content Management System for
Vuria in North Scottsdale, AZ (www.vuria.com &lt;<A HREF="http://www.vuria.com/">http://www.vuria.com/</A>&gt; ).
Most recently I developed a manufacturing system using the LAMP solution.
Please understand that data-driven design and proper systems
design/implementation is my passion.  I perform the same type of activities
in my regular 'day-job'; but, within the DB2 and Postgres areana. 

 

My preferred method of data-driven design is via the Erwin toolset.
Additionally, utilize my CodeCharge product to perform application
development (MySQL/PHP) in 1/3 the time of normal coding methods.  The
generated code is modified slightly with available 'exits' to allow for
any/all application needs.  It is my experience that the resultant code is
very error free and very reliable.  I have developed dozens of applications
and web-sites with this tool.

 

As you can see by my statements later in this email; I am a proponent of
data-driven design.  That is, the emphasis I use is on the 'data' initially.
When the navigation rules and business user interface needs are identified,
the underlying data design will flow and allow for smooth application
coding.

 

I have implemented some internal business MySQL/PHP solutions over the past
several years - of which the most recent was for a manufacturing process.
The MySQL version used was 4.1 using multiple engines (INNODB and MYISAM).
I elected to not use referential integrity (FK constraints); however, the
system could use them with no issues.  Some of the key elements I looked for
and designed were:

1)       Separation of information into 3NF (3rd Normal Form) so that
repetition and duplication is handled logically.

2)       Creation of underlying code/reference tables that drive attributes
of the system design (e.g. Color Codes for electrical wiring)

3)       Use of link names for large objects (e.g. *.jpg files) such that
MySQL queries can locate the jpg to be displayed without burdening the MySQL
database with the large object item itself.  That is, the jpg files are
actually stored in a separate folder on the Linux file system.

4)       Allow for dynamic upload of new images with automatic naming.

5)       Architecturally:

a.       Design reference/code tables (at a minimum) to allow for deletion
'flags' instead of physical delete; therefore, allowing the application to
utilize old code values on display but not for new instances of code usage.


b.       Limit the number of rows in tables for key application data needs
by creating 'inactive' prefixed tables and logic to offload
unused/inactivated information on an ongoing basis (part of application
design)

6)       Create indexing schemes for each table to accommodate complex MySQL
queries (joins and where clause use).

7)       Develop a backup/recovery plan (Data Continuity) to minimize (or
eliminate) any potential data loss from any hardware/network issue.

Hi,
 
One of our smaller clients asked us to keep our eyes open for a
freelancer with experience in PHP &amp; MySQL to create a CMS that will be
used to create custom contest entry forms.  We need someone with lots of
experience with PHP &amp; MySQL for this gig. Work will be 100% off-site,
however, we are looking for someone in the NYC metro area who can meet
for occasional briefings. Rate &amp; schedule open at this time.
 
Please respond if this looks like a good fit for you or someone you can
refer to us.
 
Best,
David
