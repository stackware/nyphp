<PRE>ASI is a dynamic, growing company looking for very talented, 
experienced programmers to join our development team.  We are not a 
startup, and have been in business for over 30 years, located in 
bucolic suburban New York.   We are a short commute from Manhattan, 
northern New Jersey, Connecticut, and the mountains.

Qualified candidates will have the opportunity to work in a 
fast-paced, collaborative environment to develop and maintain complex 
web-based systems.

REQUIREMENTS:
    * PHP expert (OO PHP 5). At least 4 years experience with PHP 4 or 5
    * Deep familiarity with MySQL (4.x/5.0/5.1)
    * Knowledge of database structures and architecture
    * Simple and complex query skills
    * Understanding of data normalization
    * Knowledge of a second language (Perl, Ruby, Python, etc.)

    * Knowledge of RCS (preferably SVN)
    * Familiar with working with a ticket management system
    * Linux fluency desired

The successful candidate will have experience with all aspects of a 
project life cycle, including an effective and compact design 
approach, full code documentation, effective communication skills and 
technical experience.

Candidate must be a self starter and quick learner, able to work well 
with other developers as well as communicate with end users.  Good 
initiative and problem solving attitude are necessary.
