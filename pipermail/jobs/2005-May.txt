	Spider, parsing, Google API and MySQL Freelance Project
Message-ID: <6.1.0.6.0.20050511185717.083ea1a0@pop.e-it.com>

OK, so here's what I need coded as a freelance project.  My team is too 
busy for these little side projects.

Let me know how much it would cost to develop this.  UI is not that 
important, I'm just looking for an easy way to get to the collected data.


Request for Quote ? Search Status Spider


Preliminary Project Specification

Project:
The idea of this project is to monitor the status of several domains in the 
top search engines. We want to be able to see changes in both the number of 
pages from a site that are in an engine (Site command) or the number of 
pages the engine sees linking into the domain (Link to linkdomain commands)
1)      Allow admin user to enter a URL to be monitored going forward
2)      Every day, at a random PM time collect the following information on 
each domain (perhaps at different times if we think the spider would get 
shut off) and store it in a DB:
a.       Google # of results for a site:URL search
                                                                i.      For 
example searching google for the query < site: phpbuilder.com  > and 
then  parsing out the number of results and store that number in the DB for 
that date and domain
b.      Yahoo # of results for a site:URL search
c.       MSN # of results for a site:URL search
d.      Google # of results for a link:URL search
e.       Yahoo # of results for a linkdomain:URL search
f.        MSN # of results for a link:URL search
3)      Allow for the selection of one or more URLs and results to be 
displayed in a chart/table. (perhaps a list with checkboxes, as I don?t 
anticipate the list getting to be more than 100 domains)
a.       Daily
                                                                i. 
Last 30 days
                                                              ii.      Or 
select date range up to 100 days)
b.      Weekly (average)
c.       Monthly (average)

Optional: (provide cost)
4)      Allow for the selection of one or more URLs and results to be 
displayed in bar graphs.


Notes:

You may want to use the Google API if it provides the number count of results.
<http://www.googleduel.com/apiexample.php>http://www.googleduel.com/apiexample.php 
I have a Google API license key or you can get one for yourself free.

Other search engines may require a spider be used to access the SERP 
(search engine results page) in order to parse out the # we are looking for.

I have a project that's been languishing for some time... 95% of the
work has been done, but there are some small tweaks that the site
owner would like done, and I don;t have the time...

So this would be a hand-off of a project that needs to be shepherded
though to production ready status, and then some occasional
post-production support

Fees, etc. to be negotiated by you directly with the client, but I
would need to give him a ball-park.

Please provide links, references, etc.
