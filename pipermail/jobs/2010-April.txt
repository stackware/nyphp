Message-ID: <7A6AF487B58B45DDAB78660B5983CD20@EMACHINE>

F-E Developer - Contract/Telecommute | 40-50/hour

My client is a B2B media company and they are looking to hire a Front-End
Web Developer for a few upcoming projects, ranging from an online
publication development project to social media applications. This is
contract work for now, but it might have the potential to turn into a
permanent position for the right person.

Here's a quick run down of the important stuff they are looking for,
ideally:

* Solid JavaScript development experience. JQuery is a huge plus. 
* Solid PHP experience. WordPress plug-in development would be great. 
* Python experience would be a huge plus. Django experience an even bigger
plus. 
* Solid HTML/CSS. This almost goes without saying. 
* Experience working with templating languages would be great. 
* Strong visual design skills. You should be able to craft amazing-looking,
functional user-interfaces even if you're not working off an explicit mockup
a designer has given you. 
* The ability to learn and adapt quickly to new languages, APIs, development
requirements, etc. 

Above all else, what they require is a strong commitment to productivity.
They are not hiring somebody because their team lacks the skill sets
mentioned above; they are hiring somebody because they have a lot of
projects on their plate and they need to increase their output.  They are
only interested in working with people who are passionate about helping them
increase the quality and quantity of development work they do. 

Although my client has an office in NYC, your geographic U.S. location is
not important, since the development team is scattered around the country.
Wherever you live, you'll have to be comfortable working with others
remotely.  You must be able to contribute as little as 20 or as many as 40+
hours per week.  

To be considered, please submit your RESUME and HOURLY requirements to
beau[AT]open-source-staffing.com

Objective: Expert Level PHP/MYSQL Web Developer


I believe when employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute
from each candidate. This attribute can be defined with one word, which is
extraordinary. But anyone including myself can label himself or herself
extraordinary. What makes me extraordinary is that I do something that
others don?t, I go the extra mile. I am the type of person that if he is
challenged to learn a new trade or a new career, I make sure that I learn
everything pertaining to that field and I make the employer happy with their
decision of taking me aboard their staff.

Throughout the years I have built many online businesses. Many have
succeeded with profit, some failed but through each success and failure I
kept striving and working towards my goals. Unlike many individuals I like
the idea of being challenged and learning new trades. I have learned and
designed graphics for many years, designed websites for many years, sold
computers to end consumers and worked as a buyer for an electronics company.
Over the years I have learned that there are two types of workers, workers
who work for the money and workers who work for their career. My goal is to
help your company succeed by applying my many talents and creativity to your
position. Consider me for your position because unlike many others, I will
go the extra mile and put your company in first place.



Skills Summary:

 Ten years of experience with Microsoft Office which includes Word, Excel,
Access, and FrontPage
 Five years of experience with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Quark and Image

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] technical lead, potential for cofounder
Message-ID: <786932.57901.qm@web55207.mail.re4.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I launched a startup last year as a site for Do It Yourselfers to connect with one another around sharing pictures of their DIY projects.  The site is growing and a major redesign of the business model and UI is in the works (contact me for a preview).  Because of crawler/privacy reasons with other people working on this startup, I'm not posting the URL here, but it shouldn't be hard to find, or contact me for more info.

I'm a business development / marketing guy.  I've had failure and success with other startups, including selling my last.  I'm president of the graduating class of a very selective tech incubator, the Founder Institute in NYC (http://www.founderinstitute.com) and I am active in NYC-area tech scene.

I'm looking for a technical lead for my startup with the potential for that role to turn into a cofounder position.  You must be ambitious, nimble, know all of the latest web technologies, creative, and, oh yeah, a kick-ass programmer.  You should recognize that a beautiful and efficient UI is just as important as the features behind it (not all agree on this) (my startup is NOT this way now and it's a problem I'm working on).  Working with a startup means late nights, acting fast, adjusting based on real data findings, and staying innovative.  If you are looking for stability, this is the not the environment for you.  In fact, most startups fail.  But, the right team makes all the difference and I'm determined to build that team.  If you're looking for an opportunity to make something great and touch peoples' lives, this is for you.  If you have the drive to change the world and the technical chops to do it, contact me now (bonus points of you encounter
lots of naysayers).  Looking for someone that can push the limits of technology and engagement.  This startup is my latest endeavor, but it's sure to lead to more.

Please tell me a little about yourself and send any examples of your work. 

Thanks,
Aaron

I am looking for a programmer/designer to help in creating an innovative
departure from the typical format of a messageboard.  I am looking for a
talented person capable of creating a good-looking and functional new
paradigm for internet help.  

 

The site, though cleanly designed, will contain some moving parts (CSS) and
be connected to a functional and sensible SQL or mySQL database.  I am not
particular about which framework within PHP is used, Symfony, was my initial
inclination but Zend is also fine.    

 

Expertise in incorporating various payment components into the DNA of the
site is an absolute must. At the minimum this means paypal.  Experience with
PCI-compliance is a big plus but regular familiarity with payment portals is
also acceptable.  

 

If you have the design, back-end, and commerce expertise I'm looking for,
please drop me a line at  <mailto:jordandrosenberg at gmail.com>
jordandrosenberg at gmail.com with some of your qualifications/portfolio and we
can begin discussing time-frame and budget.  

 

Thanks,

We got 2-3 Facebook apps to build over the next 2 months (and probably
a few more over the summer) and we need some help from a couple of
Facebook app developers.

We are looking for someone who are quick, self-sufficient and can
infer technical requirements and business logic from a conversation
over some wireframes.

You should be able to slice up photoshop to HTML/FBML and know how to
use javascript to get the job done. Experience with Flash on FB is a
plus, but not a requirement.

You'll be working from home/your office at your own schedule - just
need to be available for conversations and meet deadlines.

Interested?  email: Vidar Brekke /vidar at socialintent.com

Message-ID: <x2l2e49dd431004301418z3867fd82w3c2aa43c684666de@mail.gmail.com>

Part Time Programmer Position Available - Cake PHP based site, APACHE, mySQL
db, YUO

We have a custom Content management system developed using YUI (Yahoo User
Interface). It is a real estate site that involves a lot of image uploading.
 The Image Upload interface is malfunctioning and the original programmer is
unavailable.  We are looking for someone to install a new interface or
adjust the current one.  We'd be willing to pay around $250 total for this
task.

If this goes well we are in the process of developing a re-design front end
of the site as well, including implementing new search and sort
capabilities.  We will additionally be overhauling the CMS.  Obviously we'd
love to use the same person for those more complex tasks.

Please send replies/resumes to info at tungstenproperties.com.
