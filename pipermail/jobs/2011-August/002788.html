<PRE>[JOB] Senior PHP Developer, NYC | 110-130k  

 

This is a full time, on-site, salaried Senior PHP Developer position paying
$110,000-$130,000 depending on experience + benefits.  No telecommuting
allowed.  US Citizens or Green Card holders only please. Local candidates
only.  Full company details provided to qualified applicants. Thank you. 

 

Our client's technical team is growing. They need an experienced programmer
- especially someone who can confidently spend days (and occasional nights)
kicking ass with AJAX and JavaScript frameworks. It helps if you're a lover
of good barbecue, karaoke, and classic internet memes... but this is an
equal opportunity position so if your skills fit, you must submit. Our
client's team has pioneered the most complete system for serious
photographers to run their businesses online. They offer a powerful set of
websites and tools that help photographers display, market, sell and
distribute their photography online, and they're looking for you to help
them shape the next generation product. They've been doing this since 2005
and they're considered one of the photo industry's most exciting brands.

 

This is an opportunity to join a top notch technical team comprised of
several internet veterans with prior successes and a Chief Scientist named
one of Computerworld's top 40 under 40 (and he's still under 40). It is an
EXPERIENCED ENGINERING position for hardcore coders only.

 

Requirements: 

 

* BS/MS in engineering/computer science and significant work experience. 

* Must be able to gather requirements, design, code and test independently
as well as work jointly with the team. 

* 3+ years of programming in a scalable production environment.

 

Skills needed: 

 

* Strong knowledge of PHP, Linux, and SQL.

* Design, develop, maintain and optimize secure and scalable multi-tier web
applications. 

* Strong knowledge of databases: stored procedures, triggers, indexes, table
normalization and design. 

* Comfortable with both object oriented and procedural programming
methodologies. 

* Strong understanding of software development life-cycle and best
practices. 

 

If you are interested in this job, please submit your RESUME and SALARY
requirements to opensourcestaffing|AT|gmail.com 

 

Thank you,

Beau J. Gould
