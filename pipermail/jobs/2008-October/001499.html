<PRE>Hello, we are looking for php5 and/or MySQL instructors. Teaching experience
is desired although it is not necessary (we can train you to be a trainer)

If you have a penchant for teaching others or would like to do this on a
part-time basis, talk to us.

 

We have upcoming classes (weekdays, weeknights and weekends) and the way it
works is you will be contracted on a class by class basis. This works very
well for people who want short term commitments.

Location-wise, we are based in NYC, but the contract can be anywhere as long
as you are willing to fly. 

 

Compensation is based on your qualifications, but it certainly won't be
$10-20/hour!

 

Note: this posting is not to fill any existing classes, but upcoming ones.
Don't expect immediate contracts as there is a vetting out process, we have
to first make sure you can teach and you have the desired php or mysql
skills first. However, once you are in our system, and complete your first
successful training engagement with us, we would usually want to work with
you on a regular basis. This is definitely not for everyone, you can be a
great developer but not necessarily a good trainer and vice versa.

 

Principals only, we're not looking to contract this out to consulting
companies. Please send your resume to: <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">adam at netcominfo.com</A>

 

Thanks,

Adam Chng
