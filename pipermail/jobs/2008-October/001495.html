<PRE>I have sent what my client sent me. You have the right to not post it. I
am only doing my job here.

I don't write job descriptions for my client. And also there is no need
to get personal here. If you think it is not what you would like to
post, don't post. I don't need to hear anything else other than the fact
that &quot;your job does not qualify for posting&quot;.

 

 

 

Thanks
