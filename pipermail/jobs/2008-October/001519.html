<PRE>Dear Darren Graham,

I am a Zend Certified Professional PHP developer with 6+ yrs experience, I
have built many complex ecommerce systems, hosting platforms and XML
automation programs. I'm looking for a salary preferably 90k+ if I were to
obtain a full time position. 

Though I have been looking for out sourced contract positions where I could
provide a 15-20 hour work week, I am open to full time positions as well. 
I contract at 40-50 dollars an hour (negotiable). If you would like to see
my portfolio visit www.mataka.com &amp; www.americashostingnetwork.com

Thank you much,

Richard Mataka Jr
