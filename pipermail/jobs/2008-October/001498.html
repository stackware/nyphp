<PRE>
Thank you for that insightful reminder, David, it wasn't at all provocative.... and I'm sure it won't prompt 100 more snippy, annoying, pointless emails from this job poster.  Please let this issue die. There is no need to personally attack other recruiters, it doesn't make yourself look any better and it just annoys all of us, because no one really cares.   

 

Thank you.

It&#8217;s our job as recruiters to be sure that we make both our clients and ourselves look smart and that is rarely just posting what our clients have sent us&#8230;

I have sent what my client sent me. You have the right to not post it. I am only doing my job here.


I don&#8217;t write job descriptions for my client. And also there is no need to get personal here. If you think it is not what you would like to post, don&#8217;t post. I don&#8217;t need to hear anything else other than the fact that &#8220;your job does not qualify for posting&#8221;.
