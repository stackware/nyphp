<PRE>Ruchita,
 
As a fellow recruiter, I have two helpful hints:
 
First, you should not just send the job description out without at least editing it to try to add some value (or at least not give away the client) and to make the description accessible and appealing.
 
Second, the email does not go to a moderator; it goes to the whole list... it is subject to everyone's criticism and/or response.

I have sent what my client sent me. You have the right to not post it. I am only doing my job here.
I don&#146;t write job descriptions for my client. And also there is no need to get personal here. If you think it is not what you would like to post, don&#146;t post. I don&#146;t need to hear anything else other than the fact that &#147;your job does not qualify for posting&#148;.
 
 
 
Thanks
