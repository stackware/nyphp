Can you please post the following to your members?


------------------------------------
PHP/Joomla/Drupal developer needed to program a site for a design firm.
------------------------------------

Current site is www.susankayfritz.com. After years of being a  
freelance gypsy, I started my own firm. The new site will function in  
much the same way as susankayfritz.com. I have a back-end CMS powering  
the content. I can add, subtract and reshuffle projects, images and  
project descriptions on the fly.

Please email me a resume and a list of links to sites you've worked on  
with a brief description of your role on those sites to susan at freshtrajectory.com 
. In turn, I will send you .PSD layouts and a project brief/ 
functionality spec. I will need a flat fee price from you along with a  
project timeline. I need to move on this right away.





---------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note new company name and email addy...

independence. It drives all of the slave owners of our society crazy.  
Even if they cop a feel, they can?t hold on long enough to own you so  
they move on to new prey. Movement is unpredictable and frightens them.

Message-ID: <AACDE17E-6970-49B5-A42B-67DBAB0EE6A6@Bootstrapper.com>


Hot New Advertising Platform & Network Looking for Amazing Developer

Apparition Ads is a next generation Rich Media advertising platform.  
Based in NYC, Apparition Ads has been quietly developing its  
technology over the past year and in beta tests generated an average  
eCPM of $58 including on social media websites. Apparition Ads  
developed a proprietary rich media advertising unit and ad serving  
system that blows away competitive platforms. The company is about to  
launch its platform to the public over the upcoming weeks with the  
goal of rolling it out as an ad network as well as licensing the  
technology to other ad networks. Apparition Ads was founded by  
veterans of the industry and has many key relationships in place to  
sell its ad inventory and develop its brand in the marketplace.

Apparition Ads is looking for a Senior Developer to join its team and  
help build out the product. The system is built in pHp based on the  
Amazon cloud. Experience with ad serving, optimization engines and  
API's a plus. We are looking the best developer out there who is  
looking to be part of a hot startup run by top entrepreneurs in NYC.  
This isn't a job opportunity, it's an opportunity to build a big  
company and own significant equity. We need one more core developer  
who will be tasked with building out our API and working on our  
targeting and optimization engine.

Apparition Ads has been self-funded to date and has prided itself on  
its ability to Bootstrap further (one of the founders founded  
Bootstrapper.com) and we are looking for an incredible developer who  
believes in the philosophy of building lead, building hard, building  
to scale.

Is this you?

If you think so, some questions to answer:

What is the most advanced technology you've personally developed?

Have you worked in advertising technology ?

Why do you think you are qualified to be our senior developer?



Sincerely yours,

Richie Hecker

Hey Guys --

Our development team that we've been working with for a year now is looking
for some new and exciting projects/ventures.  We're helping them spearhead
the search and vetting process.  They are top notch talent and very
affordable.  Communication is great and they have always hit our deadlines.
Our partnership with them has been critical to the recent success of our
early-stage venture.

Past projects they developed include:
Qloud (Steve Case backed and acquired by Buzz Media last year)
Flipkey (Acquired by TripAdvisor last year)

They also have significant experience with large-scale integrations and SaaS
platforms.

If you're looking for talented developers and would like to learn more, let

I believe when
employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate.
This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone
including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me
extraordinary is that I do something that others don?t, I go the extra mile. I
am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new
career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make
the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff.

?

Throughout the years
I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some
failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards
my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and
learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years,
designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as
a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there
are two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work
for their career. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many
talents and creativity to your position. Consider me for your position because
unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in first
place.

Shubhajyoti should not be added.  These types of messages happen when
something like plaxo imports address books into a social network site, which

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Needing Joomla extension developer
Message-ID: <330532b60904280639r2a5574f3jf76466a0ff5a5395@mail.gmail.com>

Hey gang,

Hope the NYPHP Joomloids are subscribed to this list, don't want to
cross post...

This is a full-time position in a funded startup, reporting to me.
Looking for someone at the junior-to-intermediate level (capable of
OOP using PHP 5.2+) interested in learning to rapidly build a private
commerce site with a sophisticated admin interface, most likely using
Joomla.

I'm a Joomla founder so I'm rather biased, but have also demonstrated
consistent success on numerous projects with this approach. I'm hoping
you are at least Joomla-aware, if not fully up to speed on developing
extensions for the 1.5 series. At the bare minimum I need someone who
has already moved to OO-PHP and can write clean, consistent,
well-organized code.

If you are interested in hearing more, throw a line to me at
mpirtle at gilttravel.com and we can discuss details.

-- Mitch
