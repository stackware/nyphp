&#183; No telecommuting; must be on-site, in New York City (office near Union Square) 
&#183; Will require significant night and weekend effort 
  
Team is run by an experienced architect and senior developer.

Great potential fit for recent college Computer Science/Engineering graduate. 
  
Requirements include: 
- Proficiency with PHP and MySQL 
- Proficiency with HTML, CSS, javascript 
- Hard-working, attention to detail, and fun to work with
