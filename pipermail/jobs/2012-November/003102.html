<PRE>Hello,

I would like to preface this by saying I am NOT a recruiter and NOT in HR,
I will personally be involved in the interviewing/hiring for this position.

I am looking for a mid-level PHP developer.

The candidate should also have good RDMS skills (Postgresql would be nice).

Javascript and JQuery experience is also required.

A large portion of the code that you would be working on is a fairly
complicated MVC based web application
that handles ticketing, inventory, domain management, and accounting.

The framework is a homegrown, in-house solution however knowledge of at
least one existing PHP framework
would probably be helpful (Zen, Symfony, etc.).

We are also responsible for some Perl and Python applications as well as a
customized CloudStack application.

I really want someone who is willing to learn and enjoys working as part of
a team. One of the great things
about working here is that you will interact with the people that use your
code on a daily basis and you will
be able to see how your work makes their jobs easier. Even though we use
open source web development tools, we
don't build websites, rather we build and maintain infrastructure and
business applications. If you have
business applications development in your background it would be a plus.

The company is a small managed hosting company (50 employees) located in
Soho NYC. Salary would depend on experience.

This is a full-time salaried position.

No contractors or recruiters please.

Please reply to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">lw-dev at logicworks.net</A> if you are interested.

Glenn Powell
Lead Software Engineer
