The Talener Group is a technology staffing firm based in New York. We are
one of the fastest growing placement firms in New York, recently opened a
new office in Los Angeles, and are looking to continue adding to our staff
in both New York, and Los Angeles.

We?re looking to hire an individual with 1-3 years of sales experience. As a
Relationship Manager, your day to day responsibilities will include inside
and outside sales developing future business relationships, researching new
leads, as well as recruiting and interviewing new candidates.

With our unique, team-based environment, we offer more than the typical
recruiting firm. All of our Relationship Managers participate in both
business development and recruiting, allowing you to have a hand in all
aspects of the business. This job is best described as ?inside sales,? not
account management. In our model, each Relationship Manager is constantly
seeking new clients, while at the same time working together in their team
to recruit candidates and fill the team?s open jobs.

As our company continues to grow, both in size and geographically, therein
lies the prospect for rapid promotion within the organization. This is also
an ideal opportunity for the motivated, junior-level candidate seeking
hands-on business and negotiating skills. We prefer individuals with prior,
full-time experience in sales.

Desired traits:

?         -High energy level

?         -Entrepreneurial spirit

?         -Professional demeanor

?         -Competitive spirit

?         -Team orientated

?         -Solid work ethic

?         -Interest in technology

?         -Desire to work in sales

Technically,

"Looking to train a young, fast-thinking developer." could actually mean a
beginner/novice programmer.

I'm not sure that _age_ limitations actually has anything to do with this
post.  I read this as "Looking to train a novice, fast-thinking developer"

@Gabe: thats what you meant, no?

You may remove this listing if you feel strongly. Just looking to gain  
an asset from the php community at large. We are equal opportunity in

Gabe,

To be completely honest, it it seems like a very junior php developer might
be more hassle than it's worth.
Not to mention, nobody wants to work for those wages.

Perhaps you could post more detail about the actual position and get a
better response..

I just wanted to say that I've had some dealings with this firm and 
they are a bunch of real straight arrow guys who are all about sales.

The kind of salespeople who are smart enough to take your call even if 
there's no immediate buck in it, and I'm glad (and not surprised) to 
see they are doing so well.

Not sure how far or wide this list goes and if there are any aspiring 
salespersons out there...but if so...

NYC-based start-up looking for PHP developers in the area to join the team
(open to both part- and full-time). We're currently working on a concept
involving both a Facebook and Twitter application, and we have plans of
integrating other social media APIs in the near-future as well. We already
have a working beta up and running, and we would like to add onto the team
very soon. Our team is well-connected with reputable VCs and we're planning
to close an angel round very shortly.

We're interested in entrepreneurial developers who have a strong interest in
playing a big role in a start-up opportunity. Specifically, we're looking
for developers with:

- At least 2 years of experience using LAMP stack technologies
- Solid grasp of front-end languages: HTML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery),
XML, AJAX
- Familiarity with C/C++
- Prior experience with the Twitter and Facebook APIs preferred
- SEO/SEM experience a plus
- Prior start-up experience a plus
- BS in computer science or a related field from a top school

Please email your resume to jobs at helptwits.com. Please no agencies or
development shops.

*** Must be located in NYC
*** Competitive salary/equity compensation


Thanks,

Message-ID: <4419b3b60909061052y690e0dbfu7a52e3a485803824@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I need someone to convert Word documents to standard compliant HTML. This
pays $20 per page. If you know how to write standard compliant HTML and want
to make some extra cash this should be easy money. I estimate 20-30 minutes
per page. I am not talking about using the "save as HTML" in Word. I need
hand written STANDARD COMPLIANT HTML.
This company is a start up so there will be PHP dev opportunities going
forward. Ideally applicants should have php skills and understand what
standard compliant HTML means.

To apply send a resume and an example, both the word doc and the HTML
equivalent. The Word doc should include at least a single graphic and more
than a paragraph of text. Just put the image(s) and html in the same dir and
zip it up with the Word doc. If you want an example doc to work from email
me.

I apologize in advance if this is slightly off topic, my goal is to find a
PHP developer who wants to make some quick cash immediately and have some
programming opportunities down the road.

Thanks

Hey Sharkbait, perhaps I could save you some cash-

Assuming you are trying to make a web site out of the documents, this would be really easy to automate using the wiki function of the Vork PHP framework (http://www.Vork.us) which lets you paste Word documents into a WYSIWYG textbox and it will convert it to XHTML-valid markup before creating your wiki page. Just install Vork, create a new controller and set it to be a wiki (just add to an action- get::component('wiki')->wiki();   ) and then navigate to the page and use the wiki interface to add a new wiki page for each Word document.
