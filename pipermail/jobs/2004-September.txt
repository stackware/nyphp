Subject: [nycphp-jobs] PHP/MySQL/XHTML needed, 6 week gig.
Message-ID: <s141b9a8.001@mail.ipro.org>

Hi all,

I need someone to come in and rescue a couple of PHP/MySQL projects. They're both
your basic database/admin interface/browsable front end/group-based editing perms type
projects. You'll be working within the confines of Sitellite (sitellite.org) as the back-end.

PHP4, one is about half-done, the other is barely started. I need someone
who can listen to a director of marketing, understand what she thinks she wants versus
what she really wants, work without too much supervision and generally pump some
code out.

The gig is in Lake Success, address is 1979 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success NY if you want
to map it. It's just outside Queens on Long Island, New Hyde Park on the LIRR.

This is for immediate start, I can handle E-mail replies all weekend as I'd really like to see
someone Monday morning. Send me your most recent URL of any data you made browsable.

We are very strict about XHTML, WAI, Section 508 standards compliance, please be sure you
are conversant with accessibility issues before replying.

Let me know your desired rate, I'm thinking 10 - 4:30, 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. Send a 
current resume too, please.

Cheers

Jaz
