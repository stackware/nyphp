*Senior PHP Engineer*



Ready to step up and be the one and only PHP expert on a Python team?



A successful and rapidly growing startup has just acquired a company with a
tech product built entirely on PHP. They?re seeking a PHP expert to take
over the maintenance and build of this technology. You?ll be tasked with
integrating the technology into the startup?s primary product, which is
built in Python.



You'll report directly to the CTO and have assistance and advice from the
experts on the team: Python engineers, front end engineers, mobile
engineers and data scientists. Willingness to learn enough Python to
effectively manage the integration required. Python experience helpful, but
not required. Experience in an agile environment preferred. Knowledge of
more than one programming language a plus.


The company is just a few years in, but has already captured significant
market share. It's a great opportunity to get in early, but with a company
that is poised to succeed.



Competitive salary, benefits, stock options, flexible work schedule and a
great work environment. This is a permanent, full-time role.



Please send your resume to jovena at skillfer.com to inquire or apply.
