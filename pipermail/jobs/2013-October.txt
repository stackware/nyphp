Hi,

 

I have some work that I need immediate help with. It's a Zend/Mysql/Apache
setup. The changes are to an existing application where people fill out a
form, submit it, and then there is an admin interface. We are a small team
in the financial district. I'm looking for someone to work onsite for the
project. We are a good source of small, ongoing projects for the right
person.

 

Contact me with your resume, hourly rate and when you can get started.

 

Thanks.
