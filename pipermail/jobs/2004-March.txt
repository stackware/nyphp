PHP/Web developer 

Right Media is seeking an experienced PHP developer/architect to join
its user interface/reporting team. 

All candidates MUST have significant professional experience developing
complex, database-driven PHP applications. This is a challenging
position and is not suitable for novice or entry-level programmers. As
the application uses a database backend and runs on Unix, experience
with SQL (MySQL experience is desirable) and Unix/Linux is required. 

The developer will be responsible for the creation of a web application
that displays complex, custom reports. Many of these reports are
financial, and will be used for accounting purposes. The developer must
have strong intrapersonal skills and be able to find the ideal way to
implement requirements in a clean, elegant way. Reusable code is
important, using object-oriented design where possible. Functional tests
will be written, where possible, to validate the correctness of the
code. 

Candidates should be able to provide examples of web applications and/or
frameworks that they have developed, to discuss practical and
theoretical consequences of design choices. 


Qualifications: 


*	Professional experience developing/architecting PHP-based web
applications 
*	SQL and a good knowledge of client-server architecture a must 
*	Web page design with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS 
*	Experience administrating Apache in a Unix environment is a plus

*	Proven experience designing browser-based GUIs, writing
usability tests, and incorporating user feedback 

This position is full-time in New York City, NY. This is not a
telecommute or contract position. Salary commensurate with experience.
Right Media is an equal opportunity employer. Email resumes and
questions to ekozek at rightmedia.com.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Invitation to bid for contract to build
	Court-controlled document site
Message-ID: <00da01c40b88$9f6264e0$b23d1f43@s123>

I am the Special Master appointed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to create a Web site for online document discovery in ~100 consolidated lawsuits against a liquidated manufacturer of an ephedra product (In re Twinlabs Personal Injury Cases, No. 21 M.C. 99 (JSR)).  

The task is to build a self-indexing Internet-based document depository/exchange to be controlled by the Special Master.  The Site will be a dumb depository: whatever document searching, analysis or manipulation the user/law firms may desire they must do offline on the client side after they download the documents.  The Site must be able to handle heavy traffic until the <200 users have finished their one-time exchange of PDF files totaling ~20Gb.  Thereafter, the Site will have only light activity.

The server program will run on dedicated hardware to be installed in the Courthouse and maintained by the Court's IT staff.

I am looking for a company/programmer to build the site by combining and customizing existing open-source packages to be found by the contractor.  The work should be completed within 4 weeks after signing the contract.  I estimate the value of this work at $5,000, but the court will authorize more if the bids show that a higher cost is justified.

Bidders must be able to show working sites they have built with relevant functions (especially public html pages automatically generated from the content of forms uploaded by semi-public users) and must have references from the owners of working sites.

For detailed requirements, send me e-mail: jfniss at banet.net.
