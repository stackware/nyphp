Hi-

I am searching for someone to design a website for me.  The website that best matches my project is  www.bostonmarket.com . I come from a non-computer based background so excuse my lack of technological lingo.
Most importantly-
    -  My customers will need to be able to create personalized log-in accounts.
    -  My website will have to be able to store and deal with credit card information.
    -  Customers will need to be able to create an address book.
  
Specifically what I want from the Boston Market website is the "Online ordering".  Under the "Catering" tab....go to "Online Ordering".  I like the simple format which is used to place an order.

Basically I want to set up a catering website.  I understand that this is a fairly complex project with a substantial portion on the backend.

In your reply, I would appreciate previously completed websites.


Thank you-
Chris Tan

We were very close to launching our new member based php mysql database web 
site and our programmer has disappeared. We need someone who is great with 
php who can read someone elses code and fix the glitches quickly. There is 
also some quite complicated code where the site displays if A is connected 
to C through B (each member has lists of contacts) A is a contact of B is a 
contact of C etc.  There may be more development work to come once the new 
site launches. We are looking for someone who is reliable and will be easily 
contactable once we go live with the new site. (We are not looking for 
someone who already has a full time job.) Our site has paying members so if 
there is a glitch after we launch we will need someone who can respond 
quickly and fix it. I'm located in NYC and would prefer someone close by, 
although it is not absolutely necessary. Please contact me if you are 
interested, include your rate, a brief description of your experience and 
send any links to previous work (especailly php sites).
Thank you.

and will work along side me.  You can work from home.  You will be paid

everything.  I will refuse to work with anyone that says you dont even have

I need working PHP source code for a class that implements PHP's SPO Serializable interface, complete with the respective serialize and unserialize functions that emulate the behavior of PHP 5.0+ native serialize() and unserialize() exactly. 

In other words, any class that extends this class should serialize (and unserialize) to exactly the same string as it would if the base class did not implement Serializiable in the first place. 

The model code for this should be available by looking through the PHP C source.

The need is immediate, and the price is negotiable. For more information and to submit a bid to do the work, please reply to cgordon at mddev.com.

Message-ID: <330532b60602171103v45232e7ay4752c8ede4c8f207@mail.gmail.com>

Hi gang,

I'm helping a friend look for a CTO, and am accepting resumes and
performing interviews for them. I thought I would look here, as the
majority of the candidates they have found were not hands-on folks
with relevant FOSS experience. Yes, some of them thought PHP was a
barbituate.

So, here is the type of CTO that they are looking for - is that you?

* Well-versed in LAMP technologies
* Well-versed in high-traffic (think billions, not millions)
* Good development operational skills (revision control, change management)
* Strong understanding of development methodologies
* Strong OO background
* Can manage/negotiate vendor contracts
* Good enterprise operational knowledge (WAN/LAN, hardware, software, PBX etc)

In a nutshell, this company has fully leveraged LAMP as the core of
their business, and is living and dying by it. At present they have a
huge homegrown codebase that is no longer maintainable as it is
entirely based on procedural, ad-hoc code. The developers are all good
foot soldiers, but there is currently no "alpha male" personality to
drive technology direction.

They are looking for someone that can come in, roll up the sleeves,
assert dominance, and get things organized and streamlined so that
they can get back to their formerly nimble, agile competitive selves
;-)

Please write me back if you are interested, or know someone that might
be interested. So far the interview process has been, um, less than
promising.

Sorry if this is not up to NYPHP Job list quality. I'd rather feed the 
NYPHP community than the middlemen.

As a small-time competitive webmaster ;-) I have maintained small-job 
relationships with PHP/LAMP technologists with the following 
characteristics:

* numerous small jobs, paid via PayPal or via third-party (client) 
arrangement as freelance work
* Drupal/Joomla/Wordpress/other installs/mods
* sysadmin along the specific lines of competitive webmastering (lots of 
little details)
* scripts and code development off-the-beaten-track, in alignment with 
that somewhat-unique sysadmin stuff
* Confidentiality is of the utmost importance, so jobs are either 
obscured from their ultimate deployment (and thus are properly 
abstracted or generalized) or the developer is brought in on profit 
share (ad revenue, affiliate commissions)
* The process is often driven by SEO and Competitive 
(ecommerce/marketing) tactics. That might mean the reasons for 
requirements are not clear to you... so if you are uncomfortable doing 
something a certain way "just because", then this work is definitely not 
for you.
* Often the key driver is novelty or opportunity... so speed is 
important as is .. did I mention CONFIDENTIALITY? There is no tolerance 
for missing first-mover advantage because someone broke confidence. 
There can be no tolerance for unauthorized re-use of proprietary code or 
tactic developed for such projects (although  FOSS is fine provided any 
release is after the competitive advantage has been exhausted).

Are you interested in small project work? You will work directly with 
me. Over time you may also be included into plans on per-project partner 
basis.

If you haven't thought these comment thru, let me summarize some 
possible consequences:

* you won't be building your resume because this stuff is all 
confidential. You will see opportunities to make money and build web assets
* you will be learning first hand how Drupal/Joomla/WordPress/other are 
"broken" from the competitive perspective, and finding ways to "fix" them.
* you will sometimes feel like a spy in a Spy vs. Spy comic book 
(sometimes the white one, sometimes the black one).
* you will learn how the pros are doing things, although you may not 
learn why they work or how well they work until you participate yourself.
* you cannot pursue the same ideas/projects/tactics on your own without 
being completely shunned...and it will always be better not to be 
shunned :-)

I have more opportunity than I can manage and I have openings for 
PHP/LAMP technologists right now on a per-project, freelance basis as 
described. Some of the skills that really make you valuable include:

Faster than a speeding bullet : you can yank crappy role management out 
of an otherwise decent FOSS PHP script in a few minutes time. Or add it 
inside the day.
More powerful than a locomotive : you can mod httpconf via .htaccess or 
ssh on Dreamhost/Hostway/Westhost/WhomeverHost without calling tech 
support, and then make PHP progress on your project
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound : "make this work on that 
host as well" and "abstract this so it works over there" sound the same 
to you.

or for the nostalgic among you:

faster than a streak of lightning : "integrate <OS blog CMS> and <OS 
forum sw> and <OS links manager>" doesn't take all day
more powerful than the pounding surf : "it uses smarty - please fix that 
problem" is almost trivial for you (yes, we have CSS / designers on call)
mightier than a roaring hurricane : "it's 180GB, but we only need about 
10MB of it in MySQL for this project" != problem

Obviously this is not usually all one person... it is parsed into small 
jobs as needed and the PHP person is likely to comprise much of the glue.

If you have interest, send me your contact info and I will put you on 
the list for consideration. If you want you can highlight work you are 
proud of or skills you feel make you worthy of the short list. Those who 
are very specialized (MySQL guru, CSS guru, crack visual designer, 
Drupal/Joomla/WP expert, etc) I have definite need provided you are both 
independent and flexible (more often than not, your expert advice will 
be valued but not adopted exactly or entirely).

Note: No gmail accounts. No AOL accounts. No autoresponders. This is not 
an offer of employment. I am not a lawyer. No animals were harmed in the 
preparation of this message. If your email address includes a profanity, 
please refrain from replying to me although feel free to dream of one 
day having that opportunity again. If you would ever build a global 
search/replace/censor function without making sure that it did not 
operate within the host domain's URL, please do not reply. If you do not 
know 2 distinct meanings for the abbreviation "CSS", please do not 
reply. If you make a living bidding on small jobs or outsourcing them as 
a gc, please do not reply as you will not get rich off of me and I don't 
need any additional intermediaries (nor do the technologists working for 
me). If you are convinced that you can offer me outsourcing or related 
services or anything other than exactly what I describe here in this 
post, please do not reply. That would be spam, and spamhaus is very 
unforgiving as are many ISPs these days.
