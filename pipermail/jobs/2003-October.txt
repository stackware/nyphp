Hi all: We are a Chelsea based marketing (print and web) firm. Currently I'm
looking for someone to assist on a variety of custom PHP-based
projects--everything from an Evite-like event management system to a content
management system for an employment agency to a knowledge base.

Perfect candidate should have plenty of php and db experience, be good with
app design and preferably have good presentation layer (html, dhtml, css,
javascript) skills as well.

Please email me a resume, links to a few sites you've worked on (along with
a brief description of your involvement) and your hourly rate.

This is an ongoing freelance opportunity with a possibility of converting to
a staff position.

We needed help yesterday, so the sooner the better.

I'd go after this, but I'm just too swamped right now (which is a good

Maybe I'll send my resume over just to keep y'all on your toes. ;)

Good luck.

Just a quick question for everyone. What is the going rate for a PHP/AMP developer nowadays? This is for my own personal curiosity. Let's say this is purely a developer role, no creative/Photoshop experience.
 
I'm only looking for a range, not for anyone to divulge what they charge. It's just that the days of the $100/hr freelance developer has long gone, and I don't know what is "fair" in this market anymore.
 
Thanks,
 
Jeremy

I still try to target $85 but often go down as far as, but not below,
$50. Of course, I'll take $100 if anyone is willing to pay it. :)

I found this last sentence interesting, the fact being that a PHP/AMP developer could also be expected to do creative/layout type of work.  While I know many developers that do both, it's important, for large projects especially, to seperate the two.  On most commercial platforms, they go through great lengths to detail and explain the roles of the various team members, for instance integrator, deployer, designer, etc.  It's important to keep this in mind when locating AMP talent as well - and especially so, since the line seemingly is finer between design and development.

Per a thread on NYPHP-Talk a couple of days ago; maybe this is part of the scalibility puzzle?

It depends on the size of the project in my opinion.  I find that small projects generally work well with flat rates, but I see no reason large deployments couldn't easily go over $100/hour.  Don't forget, with AMP and someone who has system administration skills, you're getting developer/deployer/integrator in one; the only thing left is a designer :)
