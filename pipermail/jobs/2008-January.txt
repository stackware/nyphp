Hi All,

Some of you may know me from NYC*BUG, a client of mine is looking for  
some experienced PHP programmers, full-time positions available.

So here's the deal, very straightforward:

- Experienced PHP developers
- Can work as a team
- Experience with:
   - AJAX with regard to user input
   - Modern, OO approaches (PHP5)
   - Experience/Ability to understand other programming languages
   - No fear of seeing Perl running around
   - Comfortability with UNIX servers
     - Ability to work with Sysadmins to improve AMP deployment
   - WWW security experience is always a plus

Do you have friends or colleagues you work with?  Good working as a  
team?  Bring everyone in!

The office location is in SoHo, and developers are needed in the  
office daily.
However, with successful delivered projects, the position can have  
excellent telecommuting and flexible scheduling for developers.

For anyone interested:
Please email me directly,

isaac at diversaform.com

and put 'PHP Job' in the subject line so I don't miss it!

Best,
.ike

The best fit for me would be to find a company who would help with
relocation.  I would be able to get down there and start the job
sooner that way.

Why work for a single publication on its web site when you can work for 
our company and build dozens of high-traffic, popular web sites each 
year? Why be a cog in the wheel of some big bureaucracy when you can 
make decisions that directly impact the form and functionality of 
industry leading software? Why settle for less when you can join the best?


GCN Publishing, the leading Internet development firm for magazine 
publishing companies, is expanding its software development team. Put 
your programming skills to work building sites and site applications for 
some of the most exciting magazine brands in the country.

environment in which you can grow. You'll learn about a wide variety of 
B2B and consumer niches, and use your experience as a developer to 
identify needs and recommend solutions that only GCN Publishing can

and other stake-holders at some of the most important media companies in 
the industry today. Your job will be to build custom solutions using a 
combination of original code, open-source, and our shrink-wrapped 
web-based applications. Plus, you'll spend time enhancing those 
applications and working to bring new products to market.

GCN is actively looking for web programmers, developers and project 
managers with the following skills:

Experience building web applications with PHP/JAVA/JAVASCRIPT
Experience building applications with MySQL and/or SQL Server
Experience working with CSS, XML, and Javascript

Additional skills could include any of the following technologies: ASP, 
.NET, Java, C, C++, Unix, Linux, Quark Xpress, Adobe InDesign
The ability to work directly with customers and juggle multiple projects

environment with a team that is proven to be the best in its field.

It's an on site gig in Midtown, for about 6 weeks, 1099 tax status for

Thanks!
