Message-ID: <24E23D262F4140D59DA5E2861AF21B28@EMACHINE>

My NYC client needs a full time, salaried, on-site developer to work on
a platform project - building iPhone SDK libraries that can be embedded
within applications.  This job will involve a mix of iPhone SDK
development and server-side development. Server-side development is in
PHP and Java and using MySQL and PostgreSQL databases but primarily PHP
and MySQL. Android, Blackberry and various other mobile platform
development may also be part of this job.

The company is small, casual and collaborative, and they expect
developers to take a wide degree of personal initiative when developing
their projects - if you're looking to be micro-managed, this isn't the
place for you.

This position is full-time, includes health care and dental, and must be
done from our client's office in Manhattan so applicants residing in the
tri-state area are preferred unless you'd consider relocating at your
own expense.  Salary depends on experience and ability, but they'd like
to stay within the 80-110k range.  Maybe a little more for a rock star.

Please provide a resume, salary requirements and a paragraph about your
iPhone SDK experience. 

Thank you,

contribute to Affintive's day-to-day, social media-driven technology- 
related operations. We've got an awesome work environment full of  
creative marketers and technologists, and are looking for someone who  
can thrive within our casual, yet hard-working company culture.

This is a senior-level role with a small development team, so the

agency environment where solutions are applied in custom, creative  
ways for clients across industry verticals (as well as internally).  
You will act both as a mentor to our engineering team and as a client- 
facing technician able to articulate very detailed issues to non- 
technical people.

Although our solutions are proprietary, we embrace and leverage open- 
source technologies so you must possess expertise across the entire  
LAMP stack, and have proven experience developing robust, highly  
scalable, Web-based platforms (preferably multi-tenant, SaaS-based

Qualifications:

? 5-8 years of experience (3+ as lead) architecting and developing  
successful, large-scale, enterprise LAMP-based applications  
(preferably multi-tenant, SaaS- solutions related to social media,

? Expertise with object-oriented, MVC-based PHP frameworks (CakePHP,  
Zend), VPSes, AJAX/JavaScript frameworks (Prototype, JQuery, YUI),  
load balancing/scalability, memcached, enterprise search (Lucene/ 
Sphinx), cloud computing and storage (S3, E3), *nix administration,  
Apache/Litespeed, MySQL, template frameworks (Smarty), scalability  
(replication, sharding), server monitoring (Nagios, Cacti), SVN, unit  
testing (Selenium), bug tracking systems (Trac, Mantis), XHTML, XML/ 
RSS, CSS
? Experience with agile and test-driven development processes
? Experience building RESTful web services APIs for developers and  
integrating third-party web service APIs

Bonus Points:

? Experience integrating with CRM systems like Salesforce.com, content  
management systems (CMS), and legacy systems

sign-on (SSO) and protocols (Facebook connect, OpenID), and cross-site  
connectivity
? Facebook/OpenSocial and iPhone application development experience
? Expertise with other scripting and object-oriented programming  
languages

Ideal Background/Profile:

Hi everyone,

My firm is looking for a PHP rock star to lead our php-based and open
source projects. We're looking for a long term relationship - but
would test out the relationship a smaller project to start.

We're looking to expand our company's strengths beyond .Net into PHP
and open source.
You can review our website http://www.silvatechmedia.com for more info
on our firm.

In a nutshell - we're a growing web development/software firm based
out of NY and Israel. Most of our projects are ecommerce and social
networking websites. Everyone works out of their own home office. Most
of our communication with customers and our dev team is over Skype,
MSN messenger and email. So..it's ok if you work out of your jammies
but deadlines and clean code aren't so optional.

If this sounds like a good fit for you, please write back to
elissa at silvatechmedial.com with your resume, work samples, and your
rate(s). And if you have friends with other skill sets (.Net, design,
etc.) we're hiring across all departments.

Thank you,
Eliza Etzion
