doing other mobile apps as well. Every single person in application
development is expected to be a leader. If you want to be told what to
do and code quietly in the corner, this is not the place for you. They
want developers who say "I've got an idea" and will see that idea from
inception to completion. Developers are expected to keep abreast of new
technologies and use them to develop new products.

Hi there,

Affinitive is looking for a talented Senior Software Engineer to join our development team and help launch new, innovative platforms and applications. We'd prefer to find someone full-time, but are open to a contract-to-hire scenario if we find the right person (and you are able to work on-site at our NYC office).

We like to keep things agile and develop iteratively, using test-driven development and continuous integration. We whiteboard ideas when possible versus preparing 50-page detailed specs. You should have experience developing multi-tenant applications and using cloud-based services and APIs.

Requirements:

? Experience with one or more best-of-breed PHP frameworks (Lithium, Zend Framework 2.0, CakePHP, Symphony, FLOW3, FF3, etc).
? Object-oriented PHP experience (ideally 5.3.x)
? Javascript, jQuery, and JSON experience
? Knowledge of Facebook?s APIs (Graph API, Javascript SDK) and developing Facebook iframe applications
? Experience with memcache and APC

Nice to Haves:

? Experience with "NoSQL" databases (MongoDB, CouchDB, etc) as well as strong relational database knowledge
? Mobile development experience (especially using Titanium)
? Good UX/design sense
? Git version control

Most importantly, you need to be someone who is innovative, collaborative, inquisitive, confident (but not cocky), meet deadlines, and possess a ?do whatever it takes? attitude. Having a fun personality and a great taste in music is also a big plus.

Full posting here:

If you are interested in learning more, please drop us a line at engineer at beaffinitive.com - in addition to your resume, be sure to include links to relevant projects you have worked on as well as your GitHub profile (if you have one), and your salary requirements/availability. Also, please let us know how you meet our requirements, otherwise we will send you a boilerplate response asking you to address them :) Please, NO RECRUITERS and no off-site contractors or agencies.

Thanks!
