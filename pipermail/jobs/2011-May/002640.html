<PRE>
Many talented people commute from NJ to NYC for employment.  Therefore, I'm posting this for those people who are tired of commuting into New York and looking for a good-paying, rewarding job in New Jersey.  I apologize in advance if this is totally off-base, and I'm sure someone will let me know if it is.

As the new CTO, I am charged with invigorating our development group to create a tech-savvy startup environment to create next generation products.  Although ten years old, profitable, and with plenty of money in the bank, we want to rapidly grow the business like a startup, and looking forward to a financial 'event' in about three years (no official promises, though).  Employees will participate in the company's stock-option plan to allow them to participate in the upside of that growth.

Another factor that makes working here so attractive, is knowing that not only are we having fun creating new products, we are also literally making a difference in  the lives of children by helping them improve their reading and writing skills.  This fact has been proven over and over in independent research studies.  So unlike the typical faster-better-cheaper-cool product that maybe searching for a business model, we have a sustainable business with true social benefit.  Today we are serving and helping over 1 million students and teachers that love our products.

We are currently looking for 2 senior level, LAMP architect/developers with strong PHP/MySQL experience.  Our developers handle all aspects of the project from reviewing requirements with the product team, designing the solution, creating the user interface (except the graphics) and the supporting backend code using a light-weight framework that was recently created by us and is being extended as needed.  Being a small team, we look for creativity, self-motivation, and excellent communications skills.  If you fit the bill, want a challenge and corresponding reward, please contact me at the email below.

I look forward to speaking with you about the company and the opportunities here.
