<PRE>
This is a great opportunity for an individual contributor, with strong team leadership skills, who is ready to take their career to the next level.  

 

Does this describe you? The ideal candidate is someone who is an active contributor in the open source community, loves to code, and knew at a very young age that they wanted to be a software engineer. You're strong in PHP, but can code in other languages because you consider yourself to be agnostic.


 

This Venture Capital funded startup has about 14 people in NYC and launched one year ago.  They just closed an additional round of funding, and have plans for steady growth.  Development thus far has been outsourced (with a remote team in the US and abroad) and they're ready to bring on board a hands-on developer who, one year from now, will be ready to lead a team of 3 or 4 developers.    


E-commerce is a hot space to be in ....but......why is this startup special?  1.  This company is focused on the largest moving, emerging market in the world.  2.  Great culture, very friendly office, a place where you can brainstorm ideas and solve challenging problems.  3. You can have a real impact, it's an exciting time to join, and lots of new development to be done.

 

Salary is $90,000 plus sizebale equity stake plus full benefits.

 

Shoot me an email or give me a call to learn more about this, or similar opportunities.
