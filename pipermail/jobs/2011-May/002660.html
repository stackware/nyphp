<PRE>[JOB] Sr. Web App Engineer, NYC | 110-130k 

This is a full time, on-site, salaried Sr. Web Application Engineer position
paying $110,000-$130,000 depending on experience + benefits.  No
telecommuting allowed.  US Citizens or Green Card holders only please. Local
candidates only.  Thank you.

Our New York City client is looking for a  Sr. Web Application Engineer to
help build a next-generation transactional system on top of their existing
RESTful API services. They need an efficient and agile engineer who is
motivated by solving interesting technical challenges: building new
front-end applications that allow for efficient buying and selling of online
advertising inventory. This role has the potential to lead to a Team Lead or
Architect role in the future, for the right person.

Our mission is to develop web applications that are easy for our clients to
use. If you know how to write JavaScript that is blazing fast and reusable,
if you obsess over both page generation and page rendering times, and if you
are the best at what you do and interested in working with one of the
smartest engineering teams in the city, you should already be working here. 

The position requires a problem solving mindset as much as it requires web
development skills. The ideal candidate is hands-on when designing
applications and is comfortable coding off of not only a formal spec, but
also a problem statement. We release new code at least once a week (as
continuous deployment actually increases reliability), so you must be both
fast and accurate with your code and confident in your work. You'll
immediately see the results of your work and creativity - as will the rest
of our team, our clients, and the world at large.

Required: 
* 5+ years experience writing production-level HTML, CSS &amp; JS on the
client-side
* 3+ years experience using a scripting language on the server-side
* Proven experience writing fast, scalable code
* Experience consuming APIs
* Experience with writing unit tests within a testing framework
* Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24-7 environment 

Desired: 
* Mastery of at least one JS framework - we use jQuery
* Familiarity with at least one MVC framework - we use Zend Framework for
PHP
* Experience as a (hands on!) team lead or architect 

If you are interested in this job, please submit your RESUME and SALARY
requirements to opensourcestaffing|AT|gmail.com 

Thank you, 
Beau J. Gould
