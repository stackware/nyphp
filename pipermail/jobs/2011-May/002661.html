<PRE>3 Positions Available: Junior, Mid and Senior-level: These are full time,
on-site, salaried Software Engineer (PHP/MySQL) positions paying
$60,000-$130,000 depending on experience + benefits.  No telecommuting
allowed.  US Citizens or Green Card holders only please.  Local candidates
only.  Thank you.

Our New York City client is looking for software engineers with solid
server-side programming experience to develop RESTful APIs that facilitates
the buying and selling of online advertising. Their platform is very
large-scale, globally distributed across 4 data centers, service oriented,
and event-driven. They handle a hundred thousand ad serving requests per
second (100s of billions per month), and respond with very strict latency
requirements. In addition, they transport over 5 TB of data daily (and
growing!), to generate some very sophisticated analytics/optimization that
drive decisions behind the ad-serving process.

Ideal candidates are hands-on and proactive when designing applications, are
good at finding simple solutions to complex problems, and is comfortable
coding off of a problem statement instead of a formal spec.  Their
environment is open, collaborative, and encourages learning.  They release
new code at least once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases
reliability), so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and
confident in your work. You'll immediately see the results of your work and
creativity - as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world at
large. 
 
Requirements: 
* Proficiency in PHP, Java, or Python 
* Experience with server side application development and web-services,
especially REST 
* Experience with MySQL 
* Excellent problem solving skills 
* Strong sense of ownership, urgency and drive 

If you are interested in this job, please submit your RESUME and SALARY
requirements to opensourcestaffing|at|gmail.com

Thank you, 
Beau J. Gould
