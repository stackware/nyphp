<PRE>[JOB] Lead Developer, NYC 

[I had to post this job.  I wish I could take it - sounds awesome!]  

Our client is an ecommerce site with a twist....Not only do they we sell
high-end luxury items in women's fashion, but they do so in a way that
allows the consumer to &quot;bid&quot; on items in an online auction marketplace.
Sort of like a &quot;priceline for the fashion industry&quot;.  They are in the final
stages of due diligence with 2 VC firms and will soon have between 750,000
and 1 MM in additional seed funding, not including the angel funding that
has propelled them to this point. The company is just 2 people right now,
but the product has already been built, and they are looking for a CTO /
Lead Developer.  If you've only been out of school for a couple of years,
but have prior startup experience and you're a brilliant developer with an
entrepreneurial spirit, they'd like to hear from you. 

They are a small and nimble team and you will be working very frequently
with the Founders. Their site is written in PHP (+ MySQL) and Node.js (+
Redis). Their eCommerce platform uses the open source framework called
Protean. The version control system is Git so they need someone with
advanced LAMP capabilities / experience and, ideally, some experience with
Node / Redis and Git.  Other skill sets that are helpful: XHTML, CSS3, and
HTML5 (until they hire a Front-end developer); experience working with
third-party APIs including the Facebook platform; Photoshop / Illustrator
capabilities are helpful as well, though they already have a graphic
designer who does amazing UI / design work; leadership skills, but not
afraid to get your hands dirty and do a significant amount of coding;
architect a cloud infrastructure that can scale to billions of hits; and
most importantly: we need someone who believes in the core product, has a
crazy work ethic, and loves the start-up world.
 
* 100-115k salary plus 10-15% equity .
* Results-based workplace with unlimited paid time off. 
* Company-covered health insurance. 
* Reimbursement and time off for professional development and conferences. 
* Open workspace in Union Square! 

To be considered, please submit your resume (in any format) and salary
requirements to Beau J. Gould at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">opensourcestaffing at gmail.com</A> 
 
Thank you,
