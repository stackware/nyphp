New Museum of Contemporary Art Background
 
Founded in 1977, the New Museum of Contemporary Art is the premier
contemporary art museum in New York City and among the most important
internationally.  The Museum&#185;s mission is &#179;New Art, New Ideas.&#178;
 
The Museum is guided by the conviction that contemporary art is a vital
social force that extends beyond the art world and into the broader culture.
The Museum&#185;s purpose is to engage diverse audiences ranging from arts
professionals to those less familiar with contemporary art.  The Museum's
program of dynamic solo exhibitions and landmark group shows defines key
moments in the development of contemporary art, reflects the global nature
of art today, and spans a vast array of cultural activities and media.
 
With a curatorial program that is exemplary in its global scope and
adventurousness, the New Museum has presented the work of emerging and
established artists from over 30 countries representing five continents in
the last five years alone - as well as important contemporary American
artists.  In addition, New Museum exhibitions travel to other museums in the
U.S. and abroad.  Also, in 2000, the Museum opened the first museum space in
the US dedicated solely to new media art, and in 2003, it affiliated with
the pioneering Internet art organization, Rhizome.org.
