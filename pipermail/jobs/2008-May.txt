Hey Folks,

    A company I work with has an opening for someone with PHP and/or (L)AMP
experience to come on board immediately. PHP5 preferred but PHP4 is fine
with MySQL/Postgres experience.

    You will be assisting with a large data migration project, mainly
debugging. The position is for part time, but closer to full time hours if
you are so inclined. This position is temporary but there are also openings
for permanent hire. Pay commensurate with experience.

   Send resume to it at mnn.org or call (212) 757 2670 x351. Again this
is for IMMEDIATE hire.

cheers,

Forest Mars

Hello List,

My name is Anthony Papillion and I'm a freelance LAMP developer living and
working in NE Oklahoma (near Tulsa). I'm looking for new projects to work on

focused on customer service, have great communication shills, and can
quickly grasp and utilize new technologies.

My skills include:

- LAMP and WAMP development
- Perl (including regular expressions and network programming)
- ColdFusion
- Oracle and SQL Server DBMS
- ASP.NET
- XML
- Adobe Flex

I also offer rates substantially lower than those within the tri-state area
but with the same level of customer service. So, if you're needing something
done, get in touch and let's talk!

I can be reached at 918.926.0139 or via email at papillion at gmail.com

Hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Anthony Papillion

This is a job posting for an internet technology firm. But not just ANY internet technology firm. It's a group of innovators: art directors, developers, industrial designers, interactive artists, animators and more. At its core, the work is a creative, artistic enterprise. But we strive for the perfect marriage of creative and technology, with interactivity as their canvas. We've found international fame with our uniformly compelling and innovative web projects in the past few years. We make websites. Viral marketing. Television spots. Software. Interactive Films. Even Installation art. In fact, we've received critical acclaim for some of our more well-known installation art work. In a different twist on interactive art, we recently released a beta of our iTunes visualizer Magnetosphere as our first foray into interactive software as art.
Our next goal is a bit less lofty, but no less important: to hire some terrific web developers to join our NYC, Boston & San Francisco offices. Working for ad agencies and big brands, you'll often have to develop within existing infrastructures, so a variety of skills are needed. The ideal candidate will be at home in a multi-disciplinary environment, working on an interesting array of ecclectic projects with tight deadlines and being part of the creative process. The ideal person will have 3-5 years' experience with 2 or 3 of the following: Ruby on Rails, PHP, .Net, Cocoa/Obj-C; 3 - 5+ years' experience doing Web work; and advertising/brand experience is always a plus. 

Does this sound like an interesting gig to you? If so, drop me a line at CarolMTaylor at comcast.net, along with your resume--- and we'll take it from there.

Hello, I'm currently seeking a PHP super star, this is a full time

about the ever-changing world of software and technology. Our passion 
is building the next generation of consumer and business applications. 
We don't utilize the "factory" approach to software development, 
believing that coding is a creative process akin to an artistic 
endeavor. We also believe strongly in the benefits and sustainability 
of open source software and the philosophy behind it. 

Our desire is to find and reward the best talent in the industry. As 
such, we do not set specific salary ranges for any position within our 
organization. Instead, we base salaries on the accomplishments of 
candidates as well as their salary history.

Rails to work with our team in creating mission critical web 
applications. You'll work on a leading social networking 
site with over 500,000 new users per month.

we've begun building out the foundation for a new breed of distributed 
workplace.
