<PRE>SENIOR PHP DEVELOPER / PROJECT MANAGER 
  
An early stage funded startup seeks an individual consultant as project manager and senior developer for an open-source based web application that will serve as the core of the company's business.  The application will include significant commerce and order management functions and will be used both by consumer and business users across the internet.  It has already been architected with data model, functional architecture and systems plan in place. 
  
The consultant must have demonstrated experience building scalable open source web applications (PHP/MySQL/Apache/Linux) including: building development teams, leading development efforts, and exceptional hands-on coding.  The individual will work directly with senior management (CEO and two technology executives) and one already-engaged senior developer to ensure overall application success and should thrive in a focused but entreprenurial environment. 
  
This individual will serve two key roles on the team: 
1) play a senior developer role to code significant portions of the application; and, 
2) project manage a 3-4 person development team to execute the development, testing and launching of the application (including significant people management and significant scheduling/budgeting/scope management responsibilities) 
  
The initial opportunity is for a 3-4 month full time engagement beginning as soon as possible.  The position structure is as follows: 
&#183; Independent contractor 
&#183; Full-time dedication during full duration of project 
&#183; No telecommuting; must be on-site, in New York City (office near Union Square) 
&#183; 3-4 month build/test/launch/manage cycle 
&#183; Will require significant night and weekend effort 
  
If you are interested, please: 
- send a cover letter and resume (plain text inline preferred) to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">php_resumes at oddpost.com</A> 
- indicate from whom you heard about this opportunity 
- include &quot;Sr PHP Developer / Project Manager&quot; in the Subject of your e-mail 
[Submissions that do not meet these requests will not be reviewed.] 
  
&lt;Last note:  the application is very cool, the business is growing rapidly, and the existing team is fantastic.  Let us know if this sounds like a good fit for you!&gt;
