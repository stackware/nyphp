Subject: [nycphp-jobs] PHP OO Developer Position
Message-ID: <74E4E718733CA04AACCE437CEB92EEB303D320@montgomery.contentproject.com>

If you were at the recent NYPHP meeting and found QEDWiki interesting and/or you're a solid PHP developer we need to talk. At Schematic we constantly face the challenge of making technology support new and adventurous user interfaces for our clients and we generate proven scalable solutions to these problems every day. We need to once again grow our PHP team to support more challenging projects; we are looking for well rounded extremely competent and confident developers.

 

Please read the following job posting and if this position sounds interesting, send us an email.

 

Schematic, one of the nation's leading interactive agencies, is seeking a world-class PHP Object-Oriented Software Developer to join our New York team.  Headquartered in Los Angeles with offices in New York and Atlanta, we provide award-winning user interface, design and technology solutions for the Web, advanced devices and television. Schematic develops across a wide array of platforms including set-top boxes, game consoles, mobile devices, and the Internet. We have recently developed projects with EA, Microsoft, Amp'd, Comcast, Fox, Intel, Motorola, and MTV, among others.

 

Software Developers lead and work with project teams to architect, design, and develop systems.  Ideal candidates will have a minimum of 5 years experience in PHP creating large-scale web applications within a LAMP environment (at Schematic MYSQL, Postgres, Oracle, PHP, Python, and Ruby all count in the suite for LAMP experience). Experience with PHP 5 objects and the SPL is preferred, but we will consider strong OO developers in languages like Python and Java who have had relevant PHP exposure. We cannot stress enough the importance of being very comfortable with OO; from Flash to .NET every discipline within our technology group works in OO based languages. You must be able to architect complex applications and abstract object models, write well-structured classes, and have a solid working knowledge of the principals of OO and design/analysis patterns. Being able to communicate your OO designs with UML is an important skill when working at Schematic. 

 

An excellent grasp of SQL is a must as well as creating and maintaining sophisticated databases and tables and handling database transactions. Having worked with templating systems like Smarty, dealt with application scaling by caching, implemented session and user authentication systems, and experienced providing and ingesting web services including SOAP and RSS are all important skills for this position. Development experience using other programming languages like Perl, Java, Ruby, ActionScript, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, are definite pluses.

 

While we have a solid group of system administrators we prefer candidates that are comfortable working within and administrating a LAMP install thus, you must be comfortable working from the Linux command line. You need to understand how PHP works within the Apache web server and how modules like mod_rewrite work. You should have experience administering relational databases like MYSQL and Postgres.

 

Our technical organization is centered on team-based production scenarios, thus using CVS or subversion and bug reporting tools such as Mantis is an important part of our daily lives. Test first methodologies or unit tests should be something you are doing and plan to continue doing when you work for Schematic. You should be comfortable speaking about the work your doing to different technical organizations and non-technical staff.

 

Responsibilities:

 

- Participation in all aspects of the development life cycle (design, implement, test, document, and deploy)

- Maintain high standards of quality for code, documentation, and deliverables

- Work with project managers and development teams to create timelines/schedules

- Interact with business teams and clients to provide technical expertise and feedback

- Evaluate new technologies/tools as needed

- Mentor junior developers

- Maintain and update codebases for legacy applications

- Clearly communicate technical ideas and decisions to both technical and non-technical audiences

 

Applicants should email techjobsny at schematic dot com with a resume in plain text, RTF or PDF (no other formats will be opened). Include a cover letter outlining your skills and experience in the email. This position is full-time/permanent, on-site in our New York office. No out-of-town candidates will be considered. No recruiters please.

	seeking work in NYC
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0606141746540.10592@tribal.metalab.unc.edu>


I am a computer science graduate of Rice University. I have been working 
at ibiblio.org for the last year and a half, where my primary project has 
been Lyceum, a multi-blog derivative of WordPress. Lyceum is designed to 
be massively scalable and manageable. I am the lead architect on Lyceum, 
where I have been in charge of front and back end design, optimization and 
security concerns, and code standards and management. I manage one other 
junior programmer, and integrate features and bugfixes submitted by our 
users worldwide, often not English speakers.

I recently wrote an article about Lyceum for Red Hat Magazine:

<http://www.redhat.com/magazine/019may06/features/lyceum/>

Also, I will soon be writing for O'Reilly, about blogging best practices, 
and introductory and advanced usage of WordPress.

I am in charge of configuring and administrating source.ibiblio.org, our 
Trac/SVN project management service, so I have extensive experience 
installing and configuring SVN and Trac. When working on Lyceum I live and 
breathe SVN.

Before I was working on Lyceum, I worked on an interactive application 
with a Flash/ActionScript frontend and PHP/MySQL backend. I am very 
familiar with OO ActionScript and Flash paradigms.

I also have been working on a film on and off for 2 years 
[dissent.johnjosephbachir.org], and am very familiar with NLE paradigms, 
and issues involved with video compression and delivery.

My resume is available here:

<http://johnjosephbachir.org/resume/>

I am seeking either full-time or consulting work. Projects specifically 
focused on designing and deploying a Lyceum installation or custom plugins 
are especially welcome.

  Hi Yuliya,
   
  It was inadvertent.    I use that tool as part of my normal email communication so I know when candidates have received important messages.  Rest assured I will delete yours and any other email address which comes in through this.    I voluntarily put that graphic at the bottom of my emails because I do not want anyone to think I was trying to do anything underhanded.  
   
  Thanks for your understanding.
