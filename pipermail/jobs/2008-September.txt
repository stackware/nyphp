Drupal.

cannot assist you with visa processes.

Managing high traffic websites

Green Map System is a nonprofit sustainability mapping project that works
with nearly 500 locally-led projects in 53 countries, as seen at
GreenMap.org. By working with us in our East Village office, you will gain
great experience and contribute something very important to a more
sustainable future.  Working with your flexible schedule is not a problem.
Your transit and lunch will
be paid, and depending on experience, possibly more. We look forward to
hearing from you!

A startup with an interesting new (revenue-generating) idea  is looking for
an experienced software developer to help bring our systems to life.

This position is part-time (about 20 hours per week), onsite in our
Manhattan offices.   The project should last through mid-October.

We are looking for people with full-time, commercial experience in Linux,
PHP, and MySQL.

Requirements:

* 2 to 5 years of commercial experience coding PHP in a Linux server
environment
* Strong understanding and coding experience with the Object-Oriented
features of PHP.
* Experience with the Prado framework is a huge plus.

able to write SQL as well.
* Excellent communication skills.

Pay rate will range from $20 to $40 per hour depending on skills and

This could lead to full-time employment if both sides are really happy with
each other

Hi,

Im looking for assistance on a job for a yoga studio.

They are looking to have an online registration area where people can sign
up online and they can accept credit cards through their site.

Ultimately, I want to give them the ability to  control as much of the
system on their own.

I need a start to finish solution here.

They do not want to pay a monthly fee for the processing of credit cards,
but a per purchase fee....

Ive looked up these companies that I thought would be good solutions (but
though some may be a bit pricey):

http://www.eventbrite.com/servicetour

http://www.eventsbot.com/online-events/Yoga-class-event-registration

http://www.regonline.com/Marketing/Event/Tour/flash.aspx

Let me know your solutions for them and how you can assist with the project.

From: jobs at 3phasecomputing.com (Jobs @ 3Phase)
Date: Thu, 25 Sep 2008 13:58:17 -0400
Subject: [nycphp-jobs] NYC-local entry-level PHP programmer
Message-ID: <48DBD139.2010807@3phasecomputing.com>

Small IT and systems consulting firm in Brooklyn is looking for an 
entry-level PHP programmer (mostly) to work 25-40 hours a week on 
project work. This is an almost full-time job, although it is not 
necessary to be on site every day.

Skillsets we require:

     * You should have at least 1 year of coding PHP
     * You should have at least a passing familiarity with templating 
and the idea of separating business logic from presentation (MVC)
     * You should have some elementary knowledge of SQL and relational 
database usage
     * Working knowledge of other scripting languages is highly 
desirable, but not a deal-breaker.
     * Working knowledge of version control systems (subversion, bazaar, 
mercurial are all good)
     * It is helpful if you are familiar with (and have actually used) 
tools in the "LAMP Stack".
     * You need at least rudimentary knowledge of modern networking 
(TCP/IP, VPN technologies).
     * You must be able to think on your feet, and you must be able to 
read and follow directions.

We don't expect you to know everything (we certainly don't, ourselves!) 
but we do expect you to come with a willingness to learn and demonstrate 
that you have some knowledge.

The work environment is a small office in southeast Brooklyn. We do not 
require that you work on-site every day, but in the beginning frequent 
meetings in-office will be necessary, so if you're not local to the NYC 
area, this is not going to work. PRINCIPALS ONLY. NO COMPANIES. In case 
you missed it: PRINCIPALS ONLY. NO COMPANIES.

Please provide a cover letter explaining how you feel you fulfill the 
requirements and a resume in plain text or HTML format only. We will not 
open PDFs or MS Word/OpenOffice documents.
