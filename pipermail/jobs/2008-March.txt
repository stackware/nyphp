Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Looking for Developers to work on our Mobile Platform
Message-ID: <d05de5f20803131443q4863305fk7906f132544d6dfc@mail.gmail.com>

We are looking for great developers to join our team. But, we won't settle
for just anyone. We want the best, and only the best. Plain and simple:
we're looking for talent; if most of the following describes you, you
probably have it and we're interested:

IF YOU...
? are a self proclaimed "pro" in PHP5 with MySQL and love OOP.
? are often called "arrogant" or "cocky" by your friends or family, but can
usually back it up (at least as a developer).
? actually know what Web 2.0 is, and it bothers you when people use it just
because they can.
? developed your own version of [INSERT CLICHE WEB 2.0 WEB SITE] just to see
if you could.
? hate your corporate job, aren't making ends meet with freelance projects
or your ad-sense revenue on your blog just isn't cutting it.
? have a passion for what you do, and want to make good money doing it, but
still have fun.

Here's a little bit about us...

WE...
? develop awesome web applications. http://www.freshplatform.com (like the
Fresh Platform!)
? love what we do.
? use Mac's, and love them (we won't make you love them too, but will try!).
? work in a modern and stylish office with a great vibe.
? are young, ambitious and embrace entrepreneurial spirit.
? have a fun, satisfying and collaborative workplace.
? have a 'start-up' environment even though we've been around and growing
since 2002.
? value talent, experience and pure intelligence a lot more than degrees and
certificates.
? value our employees and take care of them, so we offer great salaries,
plenty of benefits and random perks and bonuses.

Apply here http://www.freshplatform.com/employment/position/1/fdid/107<http://www.freshplatform.com/employment/position/1/fdid/106>

Objective: To obtain a position in web development or in a junior system administrator position



I believe when employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate. This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me extraordinary is that I do something that others don?t; I go the extra mile. I am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff.

Throughout the years I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years, designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there is two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work for their career. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many talents and creativity to your position. Consider me for your position because unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in first place.

Just think about it...after working just a little more then 3.5 years on 
this job...you will have made enough money to buy Bear Stearns back from 
JP Morgan Chase. It might not even take that long.....

65 million American dollars? If you can include a 3 month annual bonus
with that and a monthly supply of exotic harems to help me through this
difficult job, I am in too. 

 

It's not the actual work involved that worries me. u jost don't realize
how difficult it is to figure out how to spend that 65 million a year. I
need all the extra perks I can get to help me figure this out.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Funded company looking for dynamic language developers
 (Front end a +)
Message-ID: <47DFB88D.80602@path101.com>

Path 101 (www.path101.com)  is looking for talented web developers who 
are ambitious, creative, independent, and hardworking. This is an 
opportunity to join an exciting company tackling a huge market--helping 
people figure out their career.


The company is funded by experienced enterprenuers from the founding 
teams of Linden Labs (Second Life), Meetup, Reprise Media, Mimeo, as 
well as angels who also invested in del.icio.us, TheLadders, Etsy, and 
Tumblr. We're offering cash compensation and generous equity.

Here are some of the interesting applications we're working on at Path 101:

# A career path visualization and recommendation tool based on data from 
over 4 million resumes! Find out what people like you actually do with 
your major and your experience.
# A syndicated network of career advice--one that enables people to 
target questions to professionals not only across industries, but from 
across many different types of web pages and networks.
# A personality tester with lots of cool social features... see how you 
compare to friends, to people in different industries--even ask your 
friends to rate your best qualities and see where they think you shine.


*The more you fit this profile, the more we want to talk to you:*

  * Must have good experience with dynamically typed languages, such
    as Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby etc. Please, no "c++/Java only" folks.
  * Must have prior web development experience
  * strong experience writing service oriented architectures
  * experience implementing binary protocols over udp or tcp
  * strong in one or more compiled / strongly-typed languages (c, c++,
    java, c#)
  * strong experience with unix and unix-like platforms (linux,
    freebsd, solaris)
  * obsessed with performance

experience with the following software would be nice to have:

  * apache
  * mysql
  * libevent <http://www.monkey.org/%7Eprovos/libevent/>
  * spread <http://www.spread.org/>


Bonus points for XHTML, CSS, UI, and/or UX savvy... Basically, if you 
like the idea, like us, and you're looking to make an impact somewhere, 
we're flexible about your skills and what you'll work on. It's early and 
there's lots to do. Let's talk.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Web Guru Seeking PHP/MYSQL Developer Position
Message-ID: <98574.7946.qm@web44905.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

  Hello,


How are you today? I am in one word a web guru with 3+ years of PHP,HTML,CSS experience. I write code as if its my native second language.


Please let me know if we can schedule an interview to meet. 

Thank you.



Nathan Hallford

 Objective: To obtain a position in web development or in a junior system administrator position 
 
 
 
 I believe when employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate. This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me extraordinary is that I do something that others don?t; I go the extra mile. I am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff. 
 
 Throughout the years I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years, designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there is two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work for their career. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many talents and creativity to your position. Consider me for your position because unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in first place.



  Skills Summary: 
 
 * Ten years of experience with Microsoft Office which includes Word, Excel, Access, and FrontPage 
 * Five years of experience with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Quark and Image Ready 
 * Five years of experience with Macromedia Dream Weaver and Flash 
 * Three years of experience with PHP, MYSQL, HTML, CSS 
 * One year of experience with C++ Programming 
 * One year of experience in unix and windows system administration 
 * Four years of experience with package design, web design, and print design 
 * Computer Assembly 
 * Computer Repair 
 * Three years of experience in customer service, retail, and telephone answering 
 * Two years of experience in office environments including administrative assistant experience

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] OT: Ajax-friendly designer?
Message-ID: <11aa01c88dbf$70ab65d0$52023170$@us>

Sorry to post off-topic, but I'm wondering if anyone has worked with a
designer they can recommend for a very quick skinning job. I have a
proof-of-concept site built using Symfony and I need to polish it up,
doesn't need to validate or anything, needs to demonstrate capabilities in a
narrow demonstration environment, but I need Web 2.0-ish and Ajaxy
loveliness and I don't have a designer up to that. (Of course, if the
proof-of-concept selss this would lead to a much larger gig.)

It's less than three weeks to deadline, I can pay up to $3k. And no, that's
not $3,000k :o) I need to get some eye candy on this:
http://cmwf.ipro.org/index.php/

If you have the skills or use someone you can recommend, please help me out
of a jam.

Cheers,

Jaz

Original posting here: http://pkp.sfu.ca/job

Student or Professional (Part/Full-Time paid position)

Please note that the team is distributed so you could work from anywhere.

The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) at Stanford University, University of
British Columbia, and Simon Fraser University is seeking an experienced PHP
developer to join the team responsible for the world's leading instance of
open source software for the support of academic journals and conferences
that offer readers free access to knowledge and universities in developing
countries opportunities to participate in the global circulation of
knowledge.

The position involves a variety of programming and systems tasks, from
support and documentation to active design, development, testing and
implementation with the PKP software suite. All work will be undertaken in
the context of a larger development team, many of whom will be working at a
variety of locations. PKP has a number of development needs, including the
implementation of a Java-based automated testing tool for use with the PKP
software, as well as PHP development projects. We are open to a variety of
work arrangements, including telecommuting. This is a fixed-term contract
with a probationary period and good potential for continuing work. Salary is
negotiable based on qualifications and experience.

Qualifications include:
- experience with current scripting languages, especially PHP.
- experience with SQL (particularly MySQL and PostgreSQL), Apache, and Linux
server administration.
- knowledge of, or experience with, PKP software (e.g. Open Journal Systems)
or a similar open source project is valuable but not necessary.

Interested PHP developers should send the following:
- a cover letter containing a summary of their experience, and at least two
references;
- a copy of their resume; and
- PHP code samples.
to Brian Owen, Associate University Librarian (brian_owen at sfu.ca).

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) - http://pkp.sfu.ca - is a federally
funded research initiative at Simon Fraser University, Stanford University,
and the University of British Columbia. PKP was established by Dr. John
Willinsky in 1998. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of
academic research through the development of innovative online environments.
PKP has developed free, open source software for the management, publishing,
and indexing of journals and current conferences. The PKP software suite is
comprised of three modules in production: Open Archives Harvester, Open
Journal Systems, and Open Conference Systems, and two in development:
Lemon8-XML and Open Monograph Press.

The current PKP website - http://pkp.sfu.ca - provides more information
about the PKP and its open source software including "test drive" versions
of the latter.

This is an opportunity to work on a meaningful, successful and exciting
project and gain experience in open source software development. In addition
to working with developers at other Synergies sites across Canada, there is
an international development community emerging around the PKP software. You
will be joining an enthusiastic and independent team and you will have the
chance to contribute to several different applications.
