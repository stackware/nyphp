Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Freelance LAMP Facebook Application Developer Needed
Message-ID: <472D1C4F-BE13-4E6B-BA63-D41F45C78624@beaffinitive.com>

Hey there,

My company, Affinitive, is looking for an experienced, reliable, New  
York City area-based Facebook application developer to work on a fun,  
short-term project/application. It will be approximately 40-50 hours  
of work over the next 2 weeks, working closely with our marketing and  
design teams. Although much of the work can be done remotely, it will  
require an initial in-person meeting with our other team members at  
our NYC offices.

In terms of the project, responsibilities will include:

- Providing initial feedback on spec/wireframes that have been developed
- Working with project management and design team
- Application development lifecycle
- In-app image manipulation (similar to other apps that utilize  
overlaying a person's face, scaling/rotating/blending). Flash/Flex  
knowledge is a big plus!

You must be skilled in highly-scalable, object-oriented PHP/MySQL  
development (mvc/zend/memcached/query tuning), have a mastery of the  
Facebook Platform (API/FBML/FQL), Javascript/XHTML/CSS, and have an  
understanding of what makes a Facebook app 'successful' and how to  
implement (legitimate) best practices to facilitate mass adoption of  
the application through a fun experience, viral growth and user-to- 
user sharing. An interest in video games doesn't hurt either :)

If you are interested, please reply and include links to/descriptions  
of Facebook applications you have launched, a description of your role  
on each project well as your hourly rate. We are looking to get moving  
right away.

Oh, and please no recruiters (you know who you are... :)

    Thanks!

   >> Bob <<

To whom it may concern, 

My name is Beau Gould and as you may or may not know, I'm a recruiter
specializing in Open Source Staffing: PHP, Python, Perl and the like.  I
also do a lot of Flash/Flex and UI/UX searches/placements too, both full
time, contract-to-hire and contract/hourly arrangements. I have a knack for
finding some of the best-of-the-best local developers, and I have many loyal
clients who continue to utilize my services for their needs as they arise.  

Anyway, I just wanted to make you aware of who I am and what I do. If you
require assistance filling any of your open positions, please do not
hesitate to ask.  Unlike most recruiting firms who charge 20-25% commission
or more for full time hires, I offer 3 options, one as low as 10%.  

If you'd like to discuss my services in more detail or allow me to conduct a
search on your behalf, I am at your service. 

Thank you for your time and have a nice day. 
 
Respectfully, 

Beau J. Gould
