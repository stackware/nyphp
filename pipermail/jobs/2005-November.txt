Message-ID: <1131062607.22904.246721355@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello,

Looking for telecommute programming work, by project.  I have four years
experience with OO PHP/ MySQL programming, and have written many
scripts and web applications using this language.  I am also very
familiar with perl (5 years),  HTML/CSS (6 years), and javascript/DHTML
(4 years), know some C++ from college degree in Computer Science, and
have training in both Unix and Windows environments.  I spend a lot of
time on the Linux command line.  You can see my most advanced work here:
http://spamEater.com/, an email "spam cleaning" web service.  My
portfolio is here: http://cfortune.kics.bc.ca/   Flash and graphics
design work is here: http://redstrat.com/  

My communication skills are excellent and I answer all messages quickly.
I am very reliable.  For three years I have worked full time as a
freelance telecommute programmer and project director with people from
around the world.  My hourly rate is $40.

sincerely,
Chris Fortune

Message-ID: <000801c5eec2$228bf1b0$111f49d1@3ds>

Hi everyone. I need someone today or tomorrow to fix or newly build a page that will get data from MySQL, and write it into an XML page. You need to make sure it will maintain character encoding for many languages, including Japanese, Chinese, Greek, etc...

The system is built but the XML interface part is not.

This job needs to be done here as there are IP restrictions to the server and don't have time to request any changes right now. If you can do it, please contact me at carlos at sprout.net ASAP. Again this needs to be done no later than this Wednesday November 23rd.

Please send me your hourly rate and some reference, your website or such. Unless we already worked together.

Thanks,
Carlos Chiossone
