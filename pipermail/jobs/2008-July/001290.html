<PRE>Kaye,
As a developer there's a couple things I'd like to see in an ad that  
that I don't typically see.  These are the kinds of things I ask  
during an interview.  At this stage in the game mostly I'm screening  
employers, rather than being screened myself.  (That's because  
development is becoming a commodity, but that's another  
conversation....)
1.  What is the technical depth of who will become my immediate  
manager(s)?  If the people I'm going to be working with don't have a  
solid sense of the technology and they are subject to the whims and  
fads of the industry, I'm not interested in working for them.
2.  What is the management orientation?  Are they product or service  
oriented?  Do they gauge effectiveness by how many hours my butt is  
in the chair?
3.  Can they articulate a problem?  It's not really that hard, but  
I've found very few people who can.  The basics are:  The thing does  
this - I expected it to do that, and here's the steps to reproduce.   
Do you know how many times I've heard, &quot;Make it faster&quot;, or &quot;I want  
it to be more stable&quot;.
4.  Does the company, management team have a clear and realistic view  
of the positioning of the company?  I really really really don't want  
to work for &quot;the next Google&quot;.
5.  Single word descriptions aren't useful, &quot;Relaxed&quot; doesn't give me  
any information.  If you want to describe the environment, then do so.
6.  And finally the project better be interesting.  If you need a  
PHP5 developer with 6 years of OO experience because your legacy  
codebase is so convoluted, then I'd like to know that going in.  Do  
you know how many &quot;unsupportable&quot; codebases I've seen? Too many.
Chris
