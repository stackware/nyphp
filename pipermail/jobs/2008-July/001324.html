<PRE>Doesn't it also depend on how long the job is?  I have people call me for a 5-hr. job where they want to talk to me for 2 hours about it before committing to hiring me to do it.  There's also the cost of administration and accounting for your projects.

If you're on a 6+-mo. contract, working full-time for one company onsite, then your operating costs are lower.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-jobs] soccer website - need help ASAP!

I have 10 years of experience with php and I charge $60 per hour.  I have seen people charge upwards of $90 per hour with the same experience.  I would say someone with 3 years of solid experience (if they really know what they are doing) should expect $30 - $40 per hour when doing contracting.

Hi,

Related to this, I'd be interested in knowing what a PHP-MySQL coder (with maybe 3 years of good experience) would cost hourly in NY/NJ. This is for a freelance project relating to a social networking site. I expect there to be a couple of input forms, the routine social networking features such as commenting, rating, &amp; the database design. The last is very crucial to me as I'd like the possibility of data to be mashed in assorted ways down the road. 

What should I reasonably expect to pay, &amp; is hourly the best way to go?

Thanks!

Susan,
 
$10.00 an hour???
 
Not for $10.00.
 
Minimum wage just increased...  
 
You should get a volunteer.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] soccer website - need help ASAP!


Hello: 
 

I am a fine art photographer based here in New York- I also run a pickup soccer group on the side. I am looking for someone with experience in the following areas to take over the maintenence and development of the soccer website (which utilizes databases and has e-commerce facets for the online registrations) and also to help me maintain my php mailing list for my photography site. 
 

I need someone ASAP for the soccer website! We are switching over to our fall season registrations soon and I need to talk to someone as soon as possible about this as I'm leaving the country next week! Please send all inquiries to me here: <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">info at susannathornton.com</A> 
 

The soccer website url is:
<A HREF="http://www.pickupsoccernyc.org">http://www.pickupsoccernyc.org</A> 
 

This is where I currently need the most help. 
The new registration has to go online by August 15th-
I am looking for someone with solid expertise in the following areas:
 

The skills you need are:
 

PHP
MySQL
SSL certificates
credit card processing
HTML
CSS
 

The last person I worked with was a student with pretty solid knowledge who I paid $10/hour but he is no longer available to work on this. Thanks.
