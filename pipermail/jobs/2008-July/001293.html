<PRE>Tony and Joseph as with any profession out there people that operate in
a less than a reputable way give the others that do not operate in that
fashion a bad reputation. Tony I am glad you responded I was going to
then thought well some recruiters do operate in that manner. 

 

Thank You,

Hi Tony,
I would like to say this before 10 or more other recruiters respond...
My experience has been exactly what I've described. You can say &quot;you're
wrong&quot; and I can't fault you for trying to defend yourselves. My intent
here is not to offend anyone - but rather open your eyes to the
practices of many of the recruiters that post here - and work off the
major job boards.

Hey Joeseph - 

I don't want to get in the middle of all the posting on the board, but I
have to say you are entirely wrong when it comes to your understanding
how recruiters work.

I do direct placement recruiting - therefore I'm paid either a flat fee,
or a % of salary for the programmer that is hired. I would have every
motivation in the world to get my candidate a higher salary, because in
turn I would be compensated higher.

What you might be referring to is contract recruiters, where a company
gives them say $80/hr to find them a developer, and if you find one that
fits their needs for $60/hr you would get the difference in pay? I'm not
sure as I don't do this type of recruiting.. but please realize there
are many different models that people work under out there before
posting these things when you are not entirely sure how the industry
works.

Thanks,

Tony Sternberg

I'm usually silent throughout these rants but... 

There is no EOE (equal opportunity employment) when working with a
recruiter. I'm not saying that all recruiters are bad - but they are not
there to help you negotiate your salary... they are negotiating their
commission. 

Recruiters will ask you &quot;what is the least amount of salary you will
accept for this position?&quot;. That same recruiter will go on to the next
person and ask them the same question. They will take the lowest bidder
and pass them on to their client. 

This is bad because it lowers your salary for the entire time you are
employed at a company. &quot;They&quot; (meaning companies hiring and recruiters)
love this game. Recruiters make a hefty commission and companies use
part of your salary to pay them. The company hiring for the position is
supposed to pay the recruiter - but they are doing it with your money.
This also means that the company is getting a &quot;bargain&quot; because they
only have to pay a recruiter once - meanwhile you are making less money
than you should be for the remaining time of your employment. 

This is bad for the companies looking to fill a position because they
are not going to get the best candidate for a position. They will get
the lowest bidder not the most qualified person.

Environment: Relaxed

    

can often mean

    

&quot;Not

 only does our senior management LOOK like a bunch of potheads in 

their super relaxed casual wear, they actually ARE a bunch of potheads, 

and this is their first real job, and therefore while THEY may find the 

environment relaxed, you their employee will be subject to constant 

boneheaded reversals and poor decision making skills on their part 

ensuring that you are anything BUT relaxed.&quot;

&gt;<i> stuff like

want 

&gt;<i> you to dress this way too, because if you're comfortable in your

&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> This is a prime example of what you do not want to say.

&gt;<i> &gt; Listening to the list last night and this morning, why not tell us

&gt;<i> &gt; recruiters, both in-house and agency, what you want to see in the

ads?

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; I've cut this down to the bone. I've got more information but

all 

the 

&gt;<i> &gt; verbiage in an email isn't as good as a 10 minute conversation

with 

&gt;<i> me,

&gt;<i> &gt; and a face to face with the client company.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>
 

&gt;<i> &gt; Location: Union Square, NYC

the
