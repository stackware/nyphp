<PRE>Hello,

mysql, xhtml, css, javascript experience and do have a very good knowledge of actionscript 2 and 3.

Thank you

Objective: To obtain a position in web development or in a junior system administrator position



I believe when employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate. This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me extraordinary is that I do something that others don&#8217;t, I go the extra mile. I am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff.

Throughout the years I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years, designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there is two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work for their career. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many talents and creativity to your position.. Consider
me for your position because unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in first place.
