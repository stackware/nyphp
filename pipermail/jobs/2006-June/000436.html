<PRE>** Position: Software Engineering at Kamida **

Kamida is seeking a few exceptionally talented engineers to work in  
our Manhattan office. These are full-time positions in a fast-paced,  
fun startup environment. We are looking to hire a Lead Software  
Engineer as well as Junior/Senior Software Engineers.

WHO WE ARE:

Our Socialight platform (www.socialight.com) lets people use their  
mobile phones to explore and share their world in new ways using  
community-generated text, pictures, and video. We&#8217;re an angel-backed  
company that has been featured in The New York Times, Business 2.0,  
and across industry-leading blogs. Our work has won multiple mobile  
and advertising industry awards.

Founded in early 2005, we&#8217;re currently a team of 2 co-founders (plus  
a couple part-time experts) and are looking for employees #3/4 to  
accelerate the development and expansion of our product vision.  As  
an early member of the founding team, you will have a large amount of  
influence on the direction of the company and will be heavily  
rewarded through equity ownership.

WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO:

We need someone to:
&#183;      Be an extremely self-motivated and prolific creator of world- 
class software

&#183;      Define development strategy, including architecture and timeline

&#183;      Lead the development effort, producing a stable, secure and  
scalable mobile and web product for our customers

&#183;      [Lead Engineer only] Manage, build, grow a development team as  
the company expands (proven success in this role could grow into CTO  
as the technology team grows)


This job is not for you unless you are excited and passionate about:
&#183;      Working very hard with a small team

&#183;      Having a significant impact on the direction of the company

&#183;      Working independently and finding creative solutions to  
complex problems

&#183;      Creating an innovative product that will change the way people  
use their mobile phones


You should have experience in the following (or demonstrate that  
you&#8217;d be able to learn very quickly!):
&#183;      [Lead Engineer only] Managing software projects with teams of  
developers

&#183;      Java (J2ME, J2EE)

&#183;      LAMP (Linux, Apache, Perl / PHP, MySQL)

&#183;      XML / XSLT (a deep understanding)

&#183;      Web Services (SOAP, REST, XML-RPC)

&#183;      Ruby on Rails

&#183;      Versioning software (RCS, CVS, Subversion)


Experience in one or more of the following gets you extra points:
&#183;      Mobile development

&#183;      GIS

&#183;      Standards based web design XHTML/CSS

&#183;      Python / BREW / Symbian C++

right for this job to jobs at socialight.com
