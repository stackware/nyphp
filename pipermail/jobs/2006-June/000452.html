  Yes, with outlook that block auto-downloaing the images it does not work.
  But what to do with web mail, and also that is free sening, in case the list of recivies is paid.
   
   
  the &quot;web 02 application&quot; is made me read everything, never heard somethign like that. WEB 2.0 yes, sure. but that phrase is rather strange.

  Hi Yuliya,
   
  It was inadvertent.    I use that tool as part of my normal email communication so I know when candidates have received important messages.  Rest assured I will delete yours and any other email address which comes in through this.    I voluntarily put that graphic at the bottom of my emails because I do not want anyone to think I was trying to do anything underhanded.  
   
  Thanks for your understanding.
