2. Proficiency in Javascript, HTML, CSS, XML
 
The following skills are A PLUS: 
 
1. BS in Computer Science or related field

Say no to the oppression of wearing pants and working in a cubicle! We
are looking for a seasoned web developer to work remotely on a
PHP5/MongoDB project running on Zend Server. If you happen to live
in the NYC area that's great too - it helps if time from time you can stop
in the office.

We don't care about your college degree, but we will want to see
examples of recent work, and you'll have to run the gauntlet with our
lead techs, so choose your code wisely.

Most job descriptions throw in "blah blah blah communication skills
blah blah", but this is a full-time (potentially) remote position, so your
communication skills and ability to work independently are absolutely
critical. Attention to detail and efficiency are key characteristics
of our ideal candidate.

REQUIRED:
- Excellent PHP5 skills
- Strong MongoDB skills
- Strong Javascript skills, both client-side and node.js servers
- Experience with the Lithium framework a big plus, CakePHP is a
decent substitute
- Ability to work within a Scrum Agile framework environment

If you're interested, send your resume PDF or link to
john at revjam.com. (Emails with MS Word attachments will be
/dev/null'd.)

Revjam.com is a bright new well-funded startup based out of New York
City, NY. Our product,  was recently with the support of the NYPHP
community in May, 2011 focused on being the premier social commerce
platform.

Message-ID: <CAPGh0+-nY5+L6vQQANJ7gvg+9YuQo8qHRWq-10kj7FvDyek7HA@mail.gmail.com>

Business Insider is looking for two awesome experienced backend PHP
developers to join the fast-paced and exciting world of being an
engineer at a journalism startup.

We're looking for some strong PHP developers who have tech chops, a
startup mindset, and the ability to work hard and play hard. Business
Insider is a great place to work. We're laid back, we don't let
bureaucracy get in our way, and we play-ping pong in the office every
day. It's honestly one of the best places I've ever worked,
personally.

Since the last time I put the word out looking for engineers back in
September, our page view traffic has almost doubled and our unique
visitors per month have almost tripled. It's an exciting time to be
here, and we face unique challenges every day due to the demands of
our huge audience and the 24/7 news cycle.

The tech team also handles basic administration of our scalable server
infrastructure, and we get exposure to cutting edge technology such as
MongoDB, due to our close association with 10gen. Our product team
pushes the boundary on feature development, resulting in a varied and
interesting assortment of tech challenges to solve.

Position requirements are as follows:

Skilled back-end programmers who can write lean object-oriented PHP 5 code
Strong front-end JavaScript and CSS knowledge a plus
Broad understanding of web architecture and how it applies to scalability
Enjoys building user-focused interfaces, using Ajax when appropriate
Experience with systems administration of Linux servers a plus
Experience with NoSQL document-based DB stores such as MongoDB a major plus
Objective-C iPhone/iPad development experience also a major plus
Strong communication skills
Based in New York -- you will need to be able to work out of our
office on Park Avenue South. Some telecommuting is fine.

We offer a competitive salary and good benefits. Please email a cover
letter, resume, and a short code sample to pax at businessinsider.com.
Thanks in advance.

Jetsetter has a couple open engineering roles in our Flatiron headquarters.  We are a small group of technology-focused engineers and product creators that are excited by travel and expanding the online experience beyond a simple search form.  We are convinced that comprehensive technologies, intelligent mining, personalization techniques, and intuitively designed products will lead us there (not to mention our fantastic creative and editorial team).

We develop primarily using PHP but are technology agnostic and like to be able to move between languages if necessary.  Above all, we value hackers and creative thinkers who use technology to solve real problems.  We are serious about things like design patterns, architecture, speed/performance, and unit testing.  We like doing things the right way.  Here are some recent examples of things we have built:

Not for nothing.  I got sick of working at home.  Seemed great until I did 
it.

I'd put my legs through two pant holes, through on the loafers or the docs 
and sitting in a stinking cubicle just to get out of the apartment.

Blah, blah, blah ...

Fuck me and my CS BA from UCB.  I got that pretty independently.

Of course, I'd settle for working at home if I have to, but nowadays even 
the ugly mugs of computer programmers are mighty inviting.  ;-)

Say no to the oppression of wearing pants and working in a cubicle! We
are looking for a seasoned web developer to work remotely on a
PHP5/MongoDB project running on Zend Server. If you happen to live
in the NYC area that's great too - it helps if time from time you can stop
in the office.

We don't care about your college degree, but we will want to see
examples of recent work, and you'll have to run the gauntlet with our
lead techs, so choose your code wisely.

Most job descriptions throw in "blah blah blah communication skills
blah blah", but this is a full-time (potentially) remote position, so your
communication skills and ability to work independently are absolutely
critical. Attention to detail and efficiency are key characteristics
of our ideal candidate.

REQUIRED:
- Excellent PHP5 skills
- Strong MongoDB skills
- Strong Javascript skills, both client-side and node.js servers
- Experience with the Lithium framework a big plus, CakePHP is a
decent substitute
- Ability to work within a Scrum Agile framework environment

If you're interested, send your resume PDF or link to
john at revjam.com. (Emails with MS Word attachments will be
/dev/null'd.)

Revjam.com is a bright new well-funded startup based out of New York
City, NY. Our product,  was recently with the support of the NYPHP
community in May, 2011 focused on being the premier social commerce
platform.

Great opportunity in Midtown NYC.  This is a temporary position. 

 

My client is a Webby Award winning web development/design firm looking
for someone to lead development on our custom content management system
and build custom applications that are used by our clients. No politics,
no bureaucracy, no dead weight and plenty of autonomy. They're small -
just three guys - but have been profitable since 2001 with a roster of
long time, loyal clients.

 

They offer a competitive salary, 100% free health/vision/dental
benefits, 401k (with company match) and regular hours that allow you to
have a life outside of work. This is an opportunity to build something,
not just be a drupal/ wordpress customizer or a cog in a large machine.

 

Your role:

 

You will spend half of your time building and maintaining applications
for our clients. Applications range from full scale content management
systems to complex e-commerce systems, video galleries and beyond. The
other half of your time will be spent further developing and refining
our core content management system and turning it into a shippable
product.

 

Who you are:

Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.1107151329540.67580@discovery.bitlancer.net>

I have a small PHP project - turning static HTML pages (about 10) into a 
mini MVC with "pretty URLs", header/footer, views, a proper router, and 
making about 2-3 forms work.  Looking for someone with solid experience 
because I want the site to be secure and easily extensible.  I don't think 
a large framework is needed - kohana, CI, or even just a small, 
scaled-down router would be fine.

Please let me know rates and availability.  Thanks!

-Matt

I am seeking a full-time (30 hours a week) permanent on-site job.  I?m looking for a mid-level position.

Compensation expected: $46k + excellent benefits, health and dental ppos including 401( k ) matching

Environment needed: casual so there will be no problem with red/violet hair, facial piercings or tattoos

The first year I?d like to work 30 hours a week.  Year 2 or 3, I?d like to go 40 hours a week if compensation is appropriate.   If compensation by year 3 is not at least $100k full-time, then I?d like to be able to openly seek new employment.

I have been programming since ?83, when it was discovered I had a talent for it.  I have over 20 years programming experience with 3 years web development.

I hold a Bachelor?s in CS from the University of California ? Berkeley.  For you who do not think much of that, then you simply don?t know what it takes to get that degree.

I work in CSS, HTML, Javascript, php, ajax, json and xml.  I have experience in Wordpress.  Recently, I?ve been looking at Facebook.

I also recently have been dabbling in jquery, which I would like to continue.

I need a position where I can continue to work on both the front and backend, although it does not have to be 50/50.

Although, most of my work has been structured, I am looking to work in an object-oriented environment.

I?m aiming for a start date of 8/15/11.

Margaret,

I hope things work out.

Another thing, you give out way too much personal information.

Regards,


Rob

Hey webmiester,

You really love to bash people on this jobs mailing list --- LOL.  Do you
actually work at Google?  Or is it just a ridicoulous and entertaining
(laughable) email address that got through their filters on registration?
:).

[I remember the days when you could add an extra space after the username
and pretend to be people.... you're not ..... on say, vBulletin -- "back in
the day" --- ... Those were the days I guess, weren't they].

Secondly: I am the one that reveals way too much personal information if
anyone:  Margaret has been posting and introducing herself slowly to anyone
paying attention on the nyphp lists; and I love her openness and curiosity
at her knowledge pursuits into the web development fields !

I bet she is 1)  more competent than you are, 2) motivated to be in PHP web
delopment; so 3: Why are you bashing someone on the PHP lists if you are on
them in the first place?

What is the problem here?

Why do you post to the entire lists when you are responding to someone in a
matter that should be private (as if that could be possible using Gmail and
Etc).

What are you Matthew?  Her cousin?

Excuse me, but in my opinion I think she reveals too much personal 
information.  I wasn't being derogatory.

Here some personal information for you.  I am 6'6", 285-lbs. Let me know 
if you want to discuss this further.

Rob

With all due respect to everyone in the community, Hans is the one that 
determines what is appropriate or not to post on both of our lists.  I 
too have been flamed vigorously for posting things which, while deemed 
to be within the rules of appropriateness, just didn't sit right for 
whatever reason with some small percentage of the community.  Whether or 
not we personally "LIKE" what people post, I'd personally like to see us 
all exhibit tolerance towards our fellow community members who work hard 
trying to earn a living by the sweat of their PHP labor, and allow each 
other to post freely within the parameters set for appropriateness by Hans.

Whether or not Margaret posts too much personal information for anyone's 
taste is irrelevant. What is relevant is that as long as Hans says that 
the particular post is within parameters (and I know he's not shy about 
pointing out when something is NOT), and Margaret wants to post it, she 
has the right to do so...as do we ALL, and we should all protect that right.

Unfortunately due to people like Rob polluting my inbox with crap I'm
unsubscribing to this list. Hans, this list should be moderated or
people should be removed from it.

Good luck everyone

I do not think she exposed too much personal information.  She exposed the information about the apartment because most people would wonder why anyone with her experience would want a job at 46k per year.  That explains it.  It does not leave that much out that makes the prospective hiring manager think she is less talented than someone else asking for 80-100k.

At first when I read it I thought good luck going from 46k to 100k+ in 3 years but i mis-understood and took it as lack of experience until I saw the part about the income cap on her apartment.

Go easy guys, at-least it wasn't a personal ad :)

Message-ID: <CABsC8rF1tGYzwrKNQSqKNKKov0tr0ofHgwwqYxRe6H0168dQuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everybody--
    We're hiring at Thrillist for backend developers of any level and
wanted to get word out to the NY PHP Community. Job description below.
Email us at techjobs at thrillist.com (and mention the jobs list!)

    Thrillist, JackThreads, and our newest family member, Thrillist
Rewards are scaling rapidly and building a team of hardcore
programmers to match our lofty ambitions. We?re looking for
programmers of all levels, preferably with experience using PHP and
MySQL. If you?re comfortable with jQuery, that is even better. Our
systems? ?cores? are Drupal 6 and CakePHP, so experience with those is
a definite plus. Other technologies we work with are MongoDB, Solr,
PostgreSQL and Amazon Web Services. If you have Sys Admin chops, we
definitely want to hear about it.

    On a daily basis you could be working on projects big and small ?
handling upgrades to a massive email campaign and send reputation
system or working on our mobile API (because after all, we also have
to support the backend for our iPhone, iPad and Android apps.) This
position requires both design and implementation work. We?ve got a
bunch of cool applications in development, some large, some small.

    We expect a ton out of our team, and because of that, we want to
make sure you?re as happy as can be. We have a conference and book
budget for continuing your education, team lunches, dual monitors and
brand new iMacs (want a PC? Let us know and we can make it happen.) We
make sure to keep our coffee machines brewing all day and have
situated Nerf weaponry around our offices for the impromptu dart war
(did we mention the Nerf budget?). Don?t forget the normal benefits,
too: competitive salary, health insurance, sick days, vacation days
and as you spend more time with our team, flexible work hours and work
place. Naturally working at Thrillist means you get access to some
pretty cool Thrillist events and occasional product (booze)
presentations right in our office.

If you?re interested and ready to start down a path sure to end in
fame and likely debauchery, send an email to techjobs at thrillist.com.

Thanks!
