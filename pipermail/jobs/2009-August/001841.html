<PRE>We have a client that is looking for a Senior Software Development Engineer.  

Description:



Their current system is a JRuby on Rails application running across 40 servers on EC2. They are looking for an amazing engineer who isn't afraid to dig into any layer of their stack, from the database, through the application code, to the server initialization scripts, to their monitoring tools. 

You also will be directly involved in the creative process of designing, building, testing, and deploying new systems, features, and functionality. You've got a track record of developing highly scalable web applications, a passion for software development, are an incredibly creative communicator and team player, enjoy brainstorming and defending your ideas rigorously, and are willing to work hard for a competitive salary and meaningful equity. 

Candidates should: 

* Have 3-5 years experience shipping well-tested, production web application code in a UNIX environment. 
* Have 1-3 years experience building web applications using Ruby on Rails. 
* Be comfortable jumping into database performance tuning in the morning, Javascript/HTML debugging in the afternoon, and finishing the day off brainstorming system architecture. You should have more hats than you know what to do with! 
* Have a firm grasp of basic Computer Science concepts such as big O notation and data structures. 
* Exhibit a strong desire to seek out and learn new things, and be as effective a teacher as a learner. 
* Know when to put down the books and dry-erase markers, fire up an editor, and start building something amazing. 

Fantastic candidates should: 

* Have experience on a small team in a fast paced startup environment. 
* Understand the benefits of agile software practices such as continuous integration and TDD. 
* Actively participate in open source software, or blog about their engineering experiences. 
* Have experience with technologies in our stack: EC2, PostgreSQL, JRuby on Rails, Apache Lucene. 
* Have worked with with machine learning, statistical analysis, or information retrieval algorithms &amp; tools.
