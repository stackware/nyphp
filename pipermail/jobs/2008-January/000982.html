<PRE>*Senior PHP Developer*

Why work for a single publication on its web site when you can work for 
our company and build dozens of high-traffic, popular web sites each 
year? Why be a cog in the wheel of some big bureaucracy when you can 
make decisions that directly impact the form and functionality of 
industry leading software? Why settle for less when you can join the best?


GCN Publishing, the leading Internet development firm for magazine 
publishing companies, is expanding its software development team. Put 
your programming skills to work building sites and site applications for 
some of the most exciting magazine brands in the country.


At GCN, we launch an average of 10 to 15 customer web sites per year for 
media companies of all sizes. This provides a challenging work 
environment in which you can grow. You'll learn about a wide variety of 
B2B and consumer niches, and use your experience as a developer to 
identify needs and recommend solutions that only GCN Publishing can 
provide.


You will work with publishers, associate publishers, C-level executives, 
and other stake-holders at some of the most important media companies in 
the industry today. Your job will be to build custom solutions using a 
combination of original code, open-source, and our shrink-wrapped 
web-based applications. Plus, you'll spend time enhancing those 
applications and working to bring new products to market.

GCN is actively looking for web programmers, developers and project 
managers with the following skills:

Experience building web applications with PHP/JAVA/JAVASCRIPT
Experience building applications with MySQL and/or SQL Server
Experience working with CSS, XML, and Javascript
Prior experience working in a team environment with CVS
Additional skills could include any of the following technologies: ASP, 
.NET, Java, C, C++, Unix, Linux, Quark Xpress, Adobe InDesign
The ability to work directly with customers and juggle multiple projects 
at once.

Although it is not required, prior experience working with a magazine, 
newspaper or industry association is a plus.

We offer a competitive salary, 401K, health benefits and a great working 
environment with a team that is proven to be the best in its field.

If you have the right background, this is the place to be.

Please note that these are full-time positions. If you are in commuting 
distance of our HQ in Norwalk, Connecticut, the position would be 
full-time in our office. If not, you would be required to telecommute 
from a home office.


If you want to grow as a software developer and be part of a winning 
team, apply now. You can e-mail your resume to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">jobs at gcnpublishing.com.</A>
