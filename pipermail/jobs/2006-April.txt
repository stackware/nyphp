* user registration systems
* database programming
* session cookie management.

Competitive salary offered. Working conditions flexible: your premises or ours. Your resume should include a link to a storefront you've worked on.

I hope this is not an inappropriate post for the jobs list.

Working as a consultant and also having hired workers in the past, I 
would just like to offer a word of advice to developers. When working 
for startups and small operations, be sure to contractually agree on a 
firmly set payment period and make those payment periods very short.. 
like once every 3 days or at most once per week. You want to minimize 
the amount of time wasted should your employers "funding" fail to come 
through. It actually works out better for both parties because the 
client is regularly updated on your work progress and you know you are 
receiving your compensation.
