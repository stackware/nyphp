Message-ID: <b9369dd60907091758m12055e68qaf4750cf842b127f@mail.gmail.com>

We are looking for an exceptional PHP developer to join our talented team
here at Connected Ventures. You will be working across our network of sites
which include; CollegeHumor, Bustedtees and TodaysBIGthing. Combined they do
over 5 million page views a day and reach over 500,000 visitors. This is an
on site, full time position at our office in Union Square, New York City.
Email your resume and PHP code samples to techjobs at connectedventures.com.
Please no recruiters or development shops.

Requirements:
* PHP
* MySQL
* Strong understanding of Object Oriented Programming
* MVC Frameworks
* Caching / Scaling (Memcached, APC)
* Subversion
* E-commerce
* Javascript, HTML/CSS, XML
* Linux or Solaris experience a plus

What?s it like to work here?
It?s confusing when you can?t tell the difference between ?work? and ?play;?
?friends and co-workers;? ?office? and ?cool place to hang out.? Confusing
is about as bad as it gets here at Connected Ventures, where Nerf-gun fights
happen, ?casual Friday? starts Monday at 10 and ends Friday at 6, and ?work?
means collaborating with your buddy at the dual screen computer next to
yours. Now, don?t assume, however, that it?s all just fun and games here:
the CollegeHumor family labors diligently all the time, they just happen to
enjoy their business more than most people.

Hi Everyone,

I know this opening is not right in the heart of Manhattan but I was hoping Central New Jersey would be close enough that I may peak someone's interest.

A client of mine located central New Jersey has a need for a senior level PHP Developer.
This is a lead role in the group created due to the heavy volume of work they have. This role will face external clients so top notch personality, presentation and communication skills are a must! There is also some local travel.

 *   Standards-compliant XHTML, CSS, Javascript, and AJAX
 *   CMS experience (experience with eZ Publish, Elgg, Joomla or Drupal a plus)
 *   Experience with implementing/integrating with 3rd party solutions (e.g. analytics, email marketing, CRM, etc.)
 *   Firm knowledge of object oriented principles
 *   Demonstrated interest in personal growth (attending industry events, training, reading, etc.)


I'm still getting the details together on salary. This opening is FULLTIME and my client is not able to sponsor or have anyone work remotely.

I am happy to discuss the position in greater detail. I can many myself available any time (nights and weekends included) to discuss the specifics.

If this opening does not interest you, please feel free to pass along my contact information onto friends or peers.

Message-ID: <8E8AF050E2C141B0B44653EF1AA7FBE0@EMACHINE>

I'm currently assisting a few "rock star", non-job-hopping,
professional, object-oriented PHP 5 Developers (with code samples) find
full time jobs in Manhattan or New Jersey (depending on the candidate)
with asking salary requirements ranging from 80-100k. 

If anyone would like to see some resume, please contact me off-list. 

Utilizing the services of a recruiter doesn't have to break the bank.  I
offer 3 options.  Please inquire if you'd like to know more.  

Thank you,

Message-ID: <1671601782.1247806444783.JavaMail.cfservice@webserver52>


Talented PHP / LAMP Developer with a passion for Social Media needed for an innovative leader in the NY Technology Community!

We have done significant work with this client resulting in the placement of 5 individuals over the past 12 months, including two members of the current technology team.  This is a great opportunity for a seasoned PHP5 developer with good communication skills and an interest in the world of social technology / media.  You'll be working across a range of projects and be expected to keep a number of balls in the air as you work on a diverse set of challenges.


The culture of this firm is perhaps their strongest selling point.  Their rampant success and solid revenue growth doesn't hurt either.  This is a chance to work with a tight-knit crew in a relaxed, organized setting.  This is a group that works and plays well together.  They're led by a management team with a track record of success in the online world, and their current investors are made up of some of the most respected names in the business.


Submit your resume today for immediate consideration on this full time on site opportunity. Candidates should have a track record of permanent employment and sponsorship is not available with this company. 




 

Cheers,

Yeah, Rob, you don?t even make sense.  There isn?t even a line about needing to be "passionate about texting " in the rec.

I love wiseass remarks but at least make sure they, you know, *correlate* to something.

Matt, there is a line about "Social Media", true.

Texting is considered social media too.  Am I the only one who is tired of

You all have a nice day.

Yeah i gotta take my word back too if "hyperboles" are the issue. I'm
tired too, people looking to hire innovative guys should come up with
innovative job descriptions aswell.

I guess most recruiters simply send the job descriptions given to them
by founders/hiring managers of the companies, who inturn get it from
some blog post of some other startups that starts every job opening
with "are you a rockstar developer" or "ready to change the world"

Change the world, yeah right why not, on every <?php tag i open..;-)

I disagree.  Many times over the past several years this has come up and
each time it is equally if not more so annoying than the past.  I signed up
to this mailing list to see available php jobs on the market.

If you don't like a particular posting or have a problem with ut, please
simply disregard it - It's not a problem, or if the list has become too
"hyperbolic" for you, then remove yourself.  Just because a posting doesn't
have exactly what you like to see in a job posting doesn't mean it isn't
valuable for someone else.

I don't want to see someone try and make a witty comment each time they see
a job posting because it doesn't fit their standards of what they're looking
to see. If you have a posting relevant to the job, by all means do it, but
please don't post to this list trying to get a few eLaughs at the risk of
discouraging future job posters from submitting their email, and at the
expense of spamming others inboxes.

They posted a job for PHP developers on a PHP job list.  If that wasn't what
you were expecting, you signed up to the wrong list.

If you need a job... get a job.  If you don't, no one cares to view 'wise-ass' comments.... dumb junk (including this response) in my inbox.

Good day.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Senior PHP5 developer - Social media
Message-ID: <bd9.37fb9e0a.3791de0a@aol.com>

 
Normally I think it's a bad idea to comment negatively on jobs posts -- in 
spite of the possible discomfort with the text, this recruiter may have 
great leads.
 
But since we're talking about it -- I think it's a culture thing.  I deal 
with a middle man to get work, and he works both the sales and technical 
sides.  When we're in a meeting with a client, and he's in sales mode, he uses a 
lot of this type of lingo at times, and many clients really like it -- 
almost a standard form of communication for some owners/entrepeneurs/investors.
 
Of course, marketing this way to techs just makes many of us kinda 
suspicious.  OTOH, if they're looking for something beyond pure tech, it might be a 
requirement of the gig to be able to deal in this type of communication 
environment.

I guess most recruiters simply send the job descriptions given to them
by founders/hiring managers of the companies, who inturn get it from
some blog post of some other startups that starts every job opening
with "are you a rockstar developer" or "ready to change the world"

Change the world, yeah right why not, on every <?php tag i open..;-)

I must agree.

Recruiters who post here are just doing their jobs.  Their only medium for
reaching many of us is email, and they're doing what they can to attract
attention.  Even in a bad economy (or especially in a bad economy) - their
task is not easy.  It is way more simple to make a web page display contents
from a database table than it is to make people agree to work with each
other.

Somebody on this list might need that job - or know somebody who needs that
job - and we need to NOT discourage recruiters from posting here.

The post was on-topic - and thus not deserving of a flame or a wise-crack.

Gotta weigh in on the side of the wise-asses.  Brian's comment is well  
taken and it's true we don't want to discourage job posters.  On the  
other hand I think there's equally good if not better value in using  
this network to reality-check with each other once in a while.  Wise  
cracks not only keep things a bit fun but they also can reflect some  
truths about the market.  I wouldn't sleep well at night thinking the  
rest of you were unanimously going around thinking of yourselves in  
all earnestness as rockstars out to change the world with your passion  
to work 20 hours a day.  If we can have the slightest influence on  
employer's expectations by means of our sarcastic feedback, so much  
the better.

Agreed all - let's keep comments useful and traffic to a minimum - not to
sound like a third grade teacher, but constructive criticism is welcomed and
benefits both job hunters and recruiters.  Having a good discussion with wit
is also important, but do remember that this list gets a lot of traffic for
a jobs list.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Question: Re:  Senior PHP5 developer - Social media
Message-ID: <1247846920.23010@coral.he.net>

I'm wondering what it means to other people on this list when they read 
something like "This is a group that works and plays well together."

Does this mean that socializing with co-workers is a requirement of the 
job?  That the office environment is loud and boisterous [see, viz., 
other job postings that mention foosball in the office, etc.] and that 
concentration may therefore be a difficult task?  Does it mean that 
there is a high value placed on "fitting in" i.e. that the team be 
homogeneous and therefore they are probably looking to bring in only 
people of a certain "type" to be on the "team"...?

Your comments and feedback are appreciated and hope that this is in the 
spirit of sincere discussion about how to read job postings!

- Kristina

I think it means it's a cohesive group. In some companies nobody talks to
each other, and it seems what they're saying is that these guys are friendly
and communicative, which is something I personally consider a big plus.

So in other words, unless the job posting specifically contains the 
exact phrases "foosball", "rock star", "Star Wars trivia" or "we all 
enjoy going out after work together for a beer, and you should really 
want to do that with us"...

I think I'm starting to understand.

It's funny how most of these things are code words for "male."

Except, actually, not so much funny at all...

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Competent Software Developer
Message-ID: <00af01ca0701$a623b480$f26b1d80$@com>

NOLOH (http://www.noloh.com) is looking for a competent software developer
to work on our various web projects. We use our NOLOH development platform
(PHP Framework/Platform,  which allows for both web and desktop developers
alike to easily develop rich web applications) for all our projects. As such
basic knowledge of PHP and OOP is necessary. We also require that you have
some experience working with databases, specifically PostgreSQL. Knowledge
of database views, stored procedures, triggers, is a big plus. 

 

Communication skills are also necessary as you'll serve as the technical
liaison in various client meetings. 


The ability to work from the command line will be useful as you'll likely be
using Darcs, Git, or some equivalent for source control. While GUIs do exist
for these tools, they're usually lacking. We'll also expect you to be able
to configure things on your own if necessary to move a project along. You
don't need to be a fully fledged "ninja", but if you are, great. 

Instead of listing the common lists of skills you normally see allow us to
phrase the requirements in another way. If you feel that you have the above
skills, if you can learn new things, and come up with creative solutions, in
short, if you're competent, we would like to hear from you. 

Code-samples would be very helpful and much appreciated. 

Initially part-time, maximum 30hrs per week. 

 

Please reply to jobs at noloh.com

 

NOLOH LLC.

Phone: 347-416-6508

Message-ID: <1247852207.24096@coral.he.net>

I will say that when you're what is referred to as a "non-traditional 
IT candidate" you definitely want to look for signs of intellect and 
open-mindedness, rather than a lockstep conformist type of mentality, 
in a potential client or employer.

Because when you're the only woman working in a large group of men, 
which as a woman in a technical field is the way it's been 99% of the 
time, there is no way you are going to "fit in".  Look for people who 
are smart enough to appreciate that doing the same thing the same way 
over and over isn't always the best way to move forward...new ideas can 
pay off.  Luckily technology is a field where this "upside-sell" can be 
very effective.  

Being a woman in a technical field can be extremely challenging, but it 
is never boring, and it is a worthy effort to undertake.

As  a recruiter, in my opinion whenever I read those type of things the first thing I think about is that the job does not pay a lot of money.

The term "rockstar" is their inarticulate way of trying to find someone senior with plenty of work experience.   When you see "foosball" and "Star Wars Trivia"  that is usually code for "we are going to try to say things to take the focus off of compensation"   I don't think it has anything to do with male vs. female...but it probably means everyone there is young


 They're led by a management team with a track record of

> success in the online world, and their current investors are made up of some of the most respected names in the business.

Whenever a posting has to references "investors" it usually means the source of your salary is coming from venture funding and not actual profits generated by the business.  If you sell 1 widget in September and 2 widgets in October you can say you grew by 100%..so when ads talk about rapid growth rate it usually implies it's a small place.   Revenue growth does not translate into profitable or viable business model.

I recruit for many other skillsets then PHP but it seems these types of Hype are more typical of PHP centric positions.

What I would know as a candidate is "What does it pay?"  and recuriters should list the salary or hourly rate into the job description.  Few job descriptions do that.

It's funny how most of these things are code words for "male."

Except, actually, not so much funny at all...

OK, so they want someone senior with tons of work experience to work 
for "low salary + equity" in a noisy office filled with 23 year old 
kids playing foosball...

YEAP that sounds about right.  :)

When PHP becomes adopted by more and more large corporate clients all of this nonesense (you get an equity stake in my cubicle)  will go away.... Bloomberg has started to implemented Flex for
some of their UI and so that day is coming closer and closer.  ( Please don't send me an e-mail telling me PHP is not the same as Flex.. I am just making a point).

OK, so they want someone senior with tons of work experience to work
for "low salary + equity" in a noisy office filled with 23 year old
kids playing foosball...

YEAP that sounds about right.  :)

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Question: Re: Senior PHP5 developer - Social media
Message-ID: <1247858828.1898@coral.he.net>

The fact that PHP is already trying to move to version 6 when 
realistically, almost half the code still in use today is 4, and people 
are still trying to wrap their heads around the most efficient way to 
use the new "features" of 5, guarantees that it's a tough sell to 
larger corporations.  The fact that it's free doesn't help either.

This does, however, bode well for those of us whose business models 
depend on debugging and stabilizing the mountains of crappy PHP code 
that are truly out there waiting for us. :)

I dunno, maybe it means they're looking for the next Zed Shaw.

I worked, briefly, for a place that had the "rockstar" bug. Base pay was 
moderate, but there was a lot of bonus potential, plus "good" retirement 
benefits -- but no health insurance. The owners got health insurance 
through their spouses, as did some of the employees. Personally health 
insurance is the main reason why I'm working a 9-to-5. It's clear to me 
that 401K makes Wall Street rich, but it's not clear that it's going to 
make me rich or secure 30 years from now.

That place was also one of those shops that contracts out to companies 
all over the place and "project management" is a euphemism for making 
excuses why your project is late, since you can't tell client A that 
their project is late because you've been working on client B's project 
and your boss thinks client B is more important than client A.

My client has a small business specializing in e-commmerce
software/solutions for small/medium sized businesses. They?ve spent
last 3 years working on a ground up rewrite in OO PHP5, MySQL5, Ajax
(Jquery), Smarty, etc.  They have had live customers for over a year now
but have not officially released the application yet.  

They are looking for someone to take over as the head developer
basically.  They need to be good with both "under the hood" type of
stuff (lower level framework) as well as UI/AJAX, etc.  They are looking
for someone that has a deep ecommerce background primarily. Someone that
has been involved in large scale products, not just projects.  Someone
that has drive, can work without direct supervision, can bring good
ideas and vision, help manage others when need, etc.  It would be a plus
if they are savvy in FreeBSD (compiling kernels, lighttpd, MySQL,
benchmarking, etc), but not a requirement.  

This is a 100% telecommute, full time job paying $50,000-60,000 per
year.  There are no benefits at present, but that might change in the
future.  My client is physically located in Boston, MA and if you lived
nearby for occasional meetings, it would be a plus, but not required. 
You can reside anywhere in the USA. 

Candidates should have held full time positions for 2 or more years. No
?job-hoppers? please.  Strong command of English a MUST since most
communication will be done via telephone, email, Skype, etc.  

Candidates should be well-versed in OO PHP 5, MySQL, UI and AJAX and
have a deep e-commerce background. 

When applying, please write up a paragraph or two highlighting your
experience as it pertains to this job description and include your
resume and salary requirements to beau-AT-open-source-staffing.com
