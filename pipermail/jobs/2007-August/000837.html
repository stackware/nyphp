<PRE>PHP Developer - Cutting Edge Open Source Environment

 

Join SellingSource.com, an industry leading developer of Technology
Driven Marketing Solutions, as a PHP Developer and become part of a
dynamic and fast growing team. Tackle a variety of projects on a daily
basis, working with cutting edge technologies from multiple
environments. Apply your PHP, OOD and programming experience to develop
code for a range of web applications, and your success will lead to
growth opportunities within the organization. If you've always wanted to
move to Las Vegas, this is your chance, as SellingSource will assist in
the relocation of the top candidate. To take a look at all the great

Founded in 1997, SellingSource.com (www.SellingSource.com) develops
technology-driven marketing solutions for the online marketplace. Its
affiliated companies offer services such as enterprise software,
campaign management solutions, online advertising, text messaging,
online data verification, stored value financial products, software
development and video production services. The firm's unique approach to
corporate development ensures that each affiliate company remains
focused on developing, selling, and supporting customer solutions, while
SellingSource.com provides consistent infrastructure, leadership, and
financial stability to each company as it grows.

 

As a PHP Developer working in our Las Vegas, Nevada office, you will
develop code for a variety of web applications, depending on the current
needs of our business. A strong understanding of overall PHP programming
techniques, including writing and interacting with objects, will be
critical as you work with other developers, project managers and the
software director to complete projects on a relatively short cycle time.
You will work with the project lead to determine priorities, and then
work autonomously to reach your goal. Comfort maneuvering in Unix is
important, as that is our platform of choice, and the ability to write
and debug SQL queries will also be helpful. Join a fast paced company
where the impact of your work can be immediately felt, and take the next
step in your career!

online interview system managed by Accolo:
