<PRE>Hello all!

 

First I would like to present you guys with a PHP Developer position right
here in Manhattan, NY.  The position is a senior level position which will
be a team lead.  The environment is LAMP based and is for a company that
specializes in digital publishing.  Preferably someone that has worked in
web environments would be ideal but the big key to the position is the
ability to lead a team.  Even if you don't have experience leading teams
send me your resume or give me a call to discuss the position and company in
depth and we can talk about where you see yourself professionally in the
future.  Salary is open.

 

Secondly the other position is located in Westport, CT.  It is a stretch
here from Manhattan but any located in the Bronx would have an easy commute
(the company's offices are located right near the train station in Westport,
CT).   The position is senior level and would be for a company that is an
established new media company that is looking to leverage a lot of open
source technologies in the framework they are building.  I do have a more
formal spec for the position and it is as follows:

 

Overview:

PHP/MySQL developer for a well-established multimedia company.

 

Responsibilities:

* Custom PHP/MySQL coding (e.g., Drupal modules and custom db queries)

* Website architecture planning

* Work with Project Manager to create Scope of Work, requirements analysis,
etc. for client projects by providing technical details and estimates.

* Code review

* Installation and configuration of Drupal-powered websites

* Patch existing modules for additional functionality

* Security updates

* Client contact throughout development process

* Work closely with the rest of our development team

 

Qualifications:

* PHP and MySQL experience required (preferably PHP 5 and MySQL 5)

* Working knowledge and experience with Drupal strongly preferred (interest
and ability to learn Drupal API and participate in the Drupal community
required)

* Unix/Linux, Apache, server administration knowledge a plus

* Knowledge of AJAX, JavaScript, XML a plus

* Experience creating client documentation (requirements, scope of work,
etc.)

* Superior written and verbal communication skills

* Client relations skills

* The ability to finish a project 100% to customer satisfaction

 

Keep in mind all resumes sent to me are confidential and will not leave my
desk without your permission.  I hope to speak with quite a few members of
this mailing list.

 

Best regards,

 

Anthony Wlodarski
