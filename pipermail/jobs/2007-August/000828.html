<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I'm looking for a lead developer or architect to work with me on the  
team at Heavy.com.  You'll need to have proven experience or strong  
technical understanding of PHP, MySQL, front-end technologies like  
Flash, Ajax, and RSS, search engine optimization, caching, web  
services (XMLRPC, SOAP, etc), application frameworks, performance  
tuning for application code, SQL, and/or Apache.  Additional  
programming languages (especially Perl) will be beneficial.  You  
should have at least 5 years of professional experience with web  
development.

An important component to this position will be the ability to manage  
developers within projects, solve technical challenges, and delegate  
solutions to developers for implementation.  Strong written and  
verbal communication skills are a necessity.

We're going to be building out new features and web sites.  We have a  
lot of legacy code that needs to be whipped into shape.  We need to  
improve the performance of our application to support increasing  
traffic levels.  Your past experiences and decision making ability  
will be key to taking our platform to the next level.


TO APPLY

I expect a cover letter with all applications for this position --  
tell me why you think you would be a good fit for this position.   
Please also include your resume and salary requirement.  All of this  
should be emailed to Mike Brittain, Director of Application  
Development, at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at heavy.com</A>

Interested, but not sure if this is right for you?  Drop me a line.   
I'd be happy to hear about your experience and see if there's  
somewhere else on the team that you can fit!
