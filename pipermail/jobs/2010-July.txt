Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Subscription Marketing Manager
Message-ID: <4C337E64.8000806@cg3.com>

This is not a development job, this is an online-marketing job working 
with a PHP- and Drupal-based financial information business.  Many of 
the regular readers of this list will know individuals with the right 
experience for this position.  We are seeking a Subscriptions Marketing 
Manager to continue the growth of our successful subscription business.  
This position is 80% online marketing, with some product management and 
product development mixed in, and the opportunity to collaborate with 
our outbound sales team.  This is a full-time position in our Jersey 
City, New Jersey office.

Qualifications

You have previous experience with subscription businesses, preferably 
related to financial services or business information, and with a strong 
online component.  You have a track record of growing subscriptions

marketing, search marketing, and related channels.  You are web-savvy 
and knowledgeable about financial markets, especially US equities.  You 
are prepared for a dynamic work environment.  You should have a college 
degree and significant previous work experience, strong communications 
skills, and excellent project management discipline.

Responsibilities

You will oversee a portfolio of subscription products which will grow 
over time.  Your success will come from the success of those products: 
how well they attract trials, convert trials to paying subscriptions, 
and retain subscribers over time.  You will work closely with product 
development and sales to assure that these products continue to meet 
customer needs, operate reliably, and get periodic feature upgrades to 
remain cutting-edge.

This job is not suitable for telecommuting or work-from-home 
arrangements, part-time employment or contractors.  You should be 
authorized to work full-time in the U.S. for any employer, we are not

Hi, and nice to meet you.

One of our favorite clients is seeking confident, capable developer to bring
on staff.

The key differentiator for this this position is level of pure awesome
regarding the people who work at this firm. Almost to the person, this

standards.  This is a really solid group, and the work environment is
causal-but-focused.

Code organization is the most important thing, followed closely by the
ability to pick up new frameworks as needed.

They?ve asked to see people at two levels:  a straight developer with two or
three yes of professional experience , and a lead developer who can work
with creatives and account-side folks to make sure what?s being written is
to spec, and can recommend add-ons and benefits.  The senior position is
hands-on, too. 

Work Evolved is a freelance and permanent placement agency for creatives and

Message-ID: <1710904859.1278989477700.JavaMail.cfservice@sl3app4>


Hi All, 

 

I am currently working on a opportunity to be the new Director of Software Engineering for one of the fastest growing startups in the city! We've partnered extensively with this firm over the past 2 years to help place over 10 full-time employees into this 60+ person firm. The responsibilities of managing a 20+ person PHP engineering team have become to great for their existing VP, so this new role is being added as a management resource to spearhead the next phase of their growth.

Our client's team of PHP engineers is also evolving as we speak. They are putting a place an environment based on smaller, more focused teams of engineers (normally 2-3 ppl per team). This Director will  directly manage 5 Team Leads, who will oversee the remaining engineers beneath them. Key responsibilities of this role involve bringing better process to their environment and establishing coding standards for all the developers to follow. 

The Director will enforce code standards and ensure that coded products match the expectations of the Product Managers and Project Management teams responsible for interfacing with the clients. In other words, there is a fair amount of release engineering responsibilities worked into this role as well.

Qualified candidates will have the following experience:




	- Strong managerial experience heading up teams of software engineers/web developers in support of web product development. 

	- All candidates must have formal web/software development experience at some point in their career, ideally in a recent capacity. 

	- Must have the ability to work closely with engineers to review their code base and look for errors and opportunities for improvement. 

	- Prefer candidates who have worked in a LAMP (PHP) environment. 

	- Excellent communication skills required.





 

Cheers,

Message-ID: <AANLkTimGehxfzeZ5guu2CYFqi-oNGiq8SXGqqjeG9iYw@mail.gmail.com>

Etsy is hiring.  We have a video about it.

http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2010/07/09/etsy-is-hiring/

We continue to search for the greatest engineers in New York City.  Our
platform makes use of many different technologies including PHP, Python,
Ruby, Scala, Javascript, Clojure, C, Java, and Matlab. Yes, Matlab. So as
you can see we need people who, ideally, already know everything. Or failing
that, are capable of learning anything.

Comparing Etsy to other places:
* Automated testing is more important to us.
* Job titles and "N years of experience" are less important to us.
* Engineers are expected to be able to manage themselves to a greater
extent.
* You will need to learn more about operations (see:
http://codeascraft.etsycorp.com/2010/02/17/dev-ops-cooperation/).

Dogs are part of the team, and are expected to commit code.

It's mostly telecommute with on-site as needed/requested + you'd get a 15k

Hello,

I'm looking for someone with experience implementing the Google checkout
API.  I've got an existing application (in php) using a custom
framework/cart and it already supports Paypal (both payflow pro and express
checkout).  I don't have the time to learn the google checkout API and the
client needs this ASAP.

I would provide you with a copy of the code with an empty function for where
the google checkout logic goes.  I will also be available on aim/gchat
during business hours to answer any questions you might have (I'm the
original dev).

The site only sells 1 product with a few different colors and the tax and
shipping rules are very simple.  I'm assuming this is not a huge project for
someone familiar with the API, so please give me some time estimates
(ballpark) and your hourly rate.

Thanks,

Jon Tascher

Hi Jon,
 
The Vork framework (http://www.Vork.us) has a component that simplifies using Google Checkout for payments, exactly what it seems like you are seeking - if it is too late in your project to implement a framework it still would be very easy to extract the Google Checkout method and put it into your codebase.

  Hello,


  I'm looking for someone with experience implementing the Google checkout API.  I've got an existing application (in php) using a custom framework/cart and it already supports Paypal (both payflow pro and express checkout).  I don't have the time to learn the google checkout API and the client needs this ASAP.


  I would provide you with a copy of the code with an empty function for where the google checkout logic goes.  I will also be available on aim/gchat during business hours to answer any questions you might have (I'm the original dev).


  The site only sells 1 product with a few different colors and the tax and shipping rules are very simple.  I'm assuming this is not a huge project for someone familiar with the API, so please give me some time estimates (ballpark) and your hourly rate.


  Thanks,


  Jon Tascher
