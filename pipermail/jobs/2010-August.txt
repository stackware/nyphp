A client of mine is looking for a small company to review and be
backup for a system I and a partner of mine wrote.

The system:
PHP
PostgreSQL
Apache
A PHP library which is a subset of an open source project
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/pmailadmin/files)
Scripts in sed, awk php and python to load the data

The task:
Review the system and it's documentation
Twice yearly review all updates and make sure that in case I got hit
by the proverbial bus  that the system will be maintained.

Background info:
Over the last 5+ years I have developed, in conjunction with a
partner, a system for a client int he financial services industry. He
is looking for a company to be a backup in case anything was to happen
to me. He is looking for a small consulting firm to do this backup.

Ideally the company would setup a local copy to make sure the system
is understood well enough to maintain it if anything was to happen to
me.

Additional y, there are some parts related to loading the data that I
am consolidating and they are into Python. Because the system grew
over time and there were several changes in the feeds the load is
right now somewhat scattered over a number of disjointed programs in
AWK, sed, PHP and Python. I am in the process of re-writing them all
to Python.

The system is fairly mature and there are not many new changes.

For consideration, please send rate information and a brief
description of your company and its qualifications.

given with the intent of making you and your work even better. You?re smart

You can articulate your ideas and solution suggestions; you can listen and
understand that not all solutions are strictly solved with lines of code.
You would like to continually push your knowledge and capabilities in all
areas of code development and welcome the chance to collaborate with other
disciplines such as UX, Graphic Design, Testing and Project Management.



What we consider to be requirements:



?       Knowledge of JavaScript frameworks and remote scripting fundamentals

?       Genuinely excited by the idea of scaling web apps to millions of
users



Send you resume and code samples in your preferred language of choice that
demonstrate your ability to develop practical solutions to difficult
problems. We prefer to see code in such areas as highly interactive
web-based applications, dynamically loaded functionality, heavy JS/DOM
interactions and event-based applications.



Local Candidates Only Please.



No H1 Visa Sponsorship Offered at this time.


Let me know if you are interested!


Cheers - Nicholas

Interested in programming for a non-profit start-up?

GiftFlow is an online gift economy where users give what they can to get
what they need. It is a market of free stuff, a social network of trust, and
a community of giving. It is a web application that strengthens community
interdependence, prevents waste and reduces costs.

Our site is still in development, but you can check out how much we have so
far. Our goal is to integrate local community organizations and non-profits
so they can list their needs and receive support from their communities
through GiftFlow.

We are looking for PHP developers to contribute to the project! Right now,
the closest we have to a social-network based gift economy is CouchSurfing,
but it is limited to hospitality. We need help to build the first gift
economy, complete with unique user identities and a reputation system, open
to all goods and services.

Ideally we are looking for volunteers (like the rest of us) who are willing
to contribute. If you are interested, please email me - hans [at] giftflow
[dot] org

creating custom Drupal websites.

?         5+ years of general experience developing consumer-facing
websites.

?         Expert proficiency with XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

?         Experience developing web applications with dynamic pages.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Seeking Freelance PHP Developer for 30 hrs / week
Message-ID: <AANLkTikVmBCxjhc63QEWTo3pbN7pNJ9ktXyt9y5p1MX3@mail.gmail.com>

If...

You: Have more that 3 years of experience coding complex websites

You: Learned PHP for the long-haul, not because it was the easiest
language to make some quick cash

You: Aren't an expert in OOP, but you've used some of PHP5's OOP
features and like them a lot

You: Use one or two PHP frameworks that you have become proficient in,
and you have at least tested Kohana out

You: Think about your code like a chess game, anticipating how each
line will effect other parts of your codebase; your foresight
minimizes debugging time becuase you often avoid the bugs as you code

You: Style your code consistently and add comments generously; you can
anticipate a great one-liner causing confusion for a future developer
and care enough to clarify your intent

You: Passionately dislike working with other people's spaghetti code,
but you love watching the script run 10x faster after you've cleaned
up their mess

You: Have managed large projects using SVN and always leave a comment
when committing files

You: Set up your local machine so that each of your projects runs on a
different domain; the location of the windows hosts file is etched
into your memory

You: Can jump into Wordpress code and make it much better, despite the
fact that you think it's messy

You: Can debug complicated MySQL queries, know when indexes make sense
(and in what order to create them), and use transactions frequently
and intelligently

You: Have tested random websites for SQL injection vulnerabilities
because they looked so poorly developed that you figured they'd be
unsecured

You: Question the wisdom of the programmer that protected his website
form with only Javascript validation

You: Are comfortable playing around with linux commands, know how to
use the console to export from SVN to a live installation, and have
configured vhost containers while logged in via ssh

You: Have learned the in's and out's of semantic CSS but you're not
afraid to add an extra "hr" or "br" to make the layout work; you know
tables are only for tabular data and you hate when they're used
otherwise

You: Know all the workarounds to make IE6 behave - styles, png display
- but you still hate IE6 with a passion

You: Have respect for JQuery and use it to enhance - not replace -
user experience; your websites are fully functional with Javascript
disabled

You: Realize that a UI that makes sense to a programmer may be
confusing to a non-techie

You: Know how to use effectively search online for a solution to your
coding problem



We want to work with you...

We are a web solutions firm with a wide range of clients. Our projects
vary in size and complexity - from completely custom platforms to
Wordpress customizations. We stand by our code and our clients love us
for it.

Currently, we have a need for 30 hours / week of freelance work; most
of the code will be e-commerce related. Your role will be working with
both front and back-end code. Compensation depends on your experience,
your availability and where you will  be working from. Remote is ok,
but you must be able to work at least one day per week from our
offices.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please send a short email
describing yourself with a few code samples attached.

I just took on a project that is on an EXTREME time crunch (September 1) and
I need a second developer to work with me to meet this deadline. Ramp up
will need to be incredibly fast  and work should be professional.  This is
NOT a website development job but modification and development on an
existing web application.

Please contact me with your rates and at least two references if interested.

Hi folks,

I'm looking for a designer for a new project my team is working on.  The 
site will be a complex LAMP site, though our internal team is doing all of 
the PHP development and database work - we're looking for someone who can 
work as our designer and integrate with our code base (clean MVC setup).

Please send examples of your work.  PHP development is a plus, as we 
wouldn't mind if this developer could also do some view manipulation (such 
as doing things like: <?PHP if ($loggedin) echo "Logged in"; ?>, etc.).

SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER

*About You:*
You are the kind of developer that can master any programming domain, given
a little time to do so. Ideally you have mastered several in the course of
your career. You write code (at least in part) because you love doing it.
You may have contributed to open source projects.

You have a computer science degree, a related degree, or an utterly
unrelated degree and life experience. Or, no degree at all and life
experience. We celebrate the fact that there are many paths one can take as
an apprentice in the craft of programming.


*About Etsy:*
Founded in 2005, Etsy is a handmade marketplace servicing over a million
active members. Our mission is to reconnect makers with consumers. We are
well-funded and have an amazing board of directors. We have offices in
Brooklyn, San Francisco, and Berlin.

For more information, see:
http://www.etsy.com/storque/search/tags/about-us/
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704596504575272613628586760.html


*What Engineering is like at Etsy:*
Etsy is a large website, and has problems similar to most in its class. You
will learn to work at huge scales.

Our code is written in: everything. Just kidding. It's written in: PHP,
Python, Ruby, Scala, Javascript, Clojure, C, Java, and Matlab. Yes, Matlab.
So as you can see we need people who, ideally, already know everything. Or
failing that, are capable of learning anything.

Comparing Etsy to other places:
* Automated testing is more important to us.
* Job titles and "N years of experience" are less important to us.
* Engineers are expected to be able to manage themselves to a greater
extent.
* You will need to learn more about operations (see:
http://codeascraft.etsycorp.com/2010/02/17/dev-ops-cooperation/).

Dogs are part of the team, and are expected to commit code.

For more, see the Etsy engineering blog at http://codeascraft.etsy.com.
