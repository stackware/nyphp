We're looking for a smart, driven Lead PHP Developer to join Double Dutch
Studios as part of the founding team. Double Dutch Studios is an innovative
NYC startup founded by a pair of successful Internet executives. Double
Dutch Studios is seed funded and has VC funding lined up once the product
hits market.



Our first product, inSparq, is a powerful service that allows people to
create groups of friends on the fly and aggregate conversations across
social networks and communication channels. inSparq  solves many of the core
problems created by large social networks in a simple, elegant way that is
respectful of user privacy. The product is fully wireframed and scoped.



We just brought on a Technical Cofounder to help us execute the vision.
We&#8217;re now looking to build out the team. Our ideal candidate is someone who
has built and launched products in a fast paced environment. Experience with
social API&#8217;s and email clients is a plus!

position will offer significant equity upside. Please reach out to

Tell us about yourself, how you use social networks and your view on the
future of digital communication. This is a competitive process and we want
to find the best fit for our team.

commitment is more important than current skill set.
