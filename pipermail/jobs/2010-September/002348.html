<PRE>Nylon Technology is looking for a few PHP developers to join our team.
We are a small (10-20 people) web development company that's been in
business for 13 years - we're located on Seventh Avenue just a few
blocks away from Penn Station.  We pride ourselves on our excellent
track record of delivering great applications to our clients.  We work
hard and play hard.  Hours are fairly flexible, dress is very flexible,
and there are no cubicles - we all sit next to the fire and love it, and
every success is shared.  In short, we are like a family.

 

We have a few positions open:

 

Senior Developer role - we're looking for a senior developer to be the
tech lead on projects and to mentor other developers.  Ideal candidates
should be smart, have at least 4 or 5 years of real PHP experience,
possess excellent written and verbal communication skills, and have some
business sense.

 

Developer role- we need a junior to mid-level developer to join the team
and grow along with us.  Ideal candidates should be smart, have at least
2 years of real PHP experience, possess excellent written and verbal
communication skills, and have some business sense.

 

For both roles, any additional experience with ColdFusion, .NET,
ActionScript, Flash, JQuery, or Python is a plus.

 

No headhunters, no part-time, and no telecommute - these are in-house
full-time salaried positions with benefits.

 

Interested candidates should send their resume, availability, and salary
requirements to me at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">shorwith at nylontechnology.com.</A>

 

Thanks,

   ~Simon
