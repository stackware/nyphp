<PRE>Business Insider is a new business site with deep financial, entertainment,
green tech and digital industry verticals. The flagship vertical, Silicon
Alley Insider, launched on July 19, 2007, led by DoubleClick founders Dwight
Merriman and Kevin Ryan and former top-ranked Wall Street analyst Henry
Blodget.

We're expanding to conquer new challenges, and we're currently seeking some
skilled PHP developers to join our tightly knit elite team of technical
samurai.

We have some big plans for the near future that will make for some great
challenges and open up some really awesome opportunities for the right
developers. We work in a laid back environment that focuses on letting great
developers do their thing without bureaucracy getting in the way. We want
coders with big ideas, who want to have a lot of input in what our products
evolve into.

We use some great cutting edge technology, especially with regards to our
heavy dependence on MongoDB. Our team works closely with the MongoDB
development team over at 10gen and we often get to live on the bleeding edge
of its development. If this scares you overly, you're probably not right for
us.

We also do in-house development of our iPhone application and a candidate
with experience in Objective C would have the opportunity to pitch in on
that.

Position requirements are as follows:

Skilled backend programmers who can write lean object-oriented PHP 5 code
Strong front end javascript and CSS knowledge a plus
Knowledge of Photoshop and a sense of design also a plus
Dreams in code and is willing to eat bugs for lunch. Beer will be provided
to wash them down.
Broad understanding of web architecture and how it applies to scalability
Enjoys building user-focused interfaces, using Ajax when appropriate
Experience with NoSQL document-based DB stores such as MongoDB a major plus
Objective-C iPhone/iPad development experience also a major plus
Based in New York -- you will need to be able to work out of our office on
5th Avenue. Some telecommuting is fine.

We have a great balance between the excitement and dynamism of a startup
while offering a lot of flexibility so you can still have a life. We want
motivated self-starters who don't need to be micro-managed, our focus is on
getting the job done, not about putting in some defined amount of time. We
offer a competitive salary and good benefits.

Technologies we use include Linux, PHP 5.3, Apache, MongoDB, Amazon SQS,
Memcached, and Objective-C.

To apply, please reply with a cover letter, resume, and a short code sample.
