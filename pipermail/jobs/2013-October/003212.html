<PRE>Job Description

InsideHook is the essential digital publication for discerning and
adventurous men.  We are looking for a stellar LAMP Engineer to join our
team in New York City.  This is a salaried, full-time position with
benefits.

Our office is located in the heart of Chelsea in Manhattan, NY.  It has an
open floor plan, a ping pong table, a comfortable living room, a relaxing
Buddha room, a kitchen table for stand-ups and is filled with sharp men and
women determined to be tremendously successful.  We often host guest
speakers who are at the top of their game during our weekly, catered
lunches on Fridays.  And for those days when you need to isolate yourself
to bang out code, take advantage of the position's flexible telecommuting
policy.

What you will do:

   - Develop feature enhancements for our web site and strengthen our
   unparalleled subscription growth
   - Assume responsibility of InsideHook's proprietary content management
   system and sharpen our competitive advantage in the realm of analytics and
   scalability
   - Build RESTful web services to advance our content distribution
   capabilities
   - Design mobile application architectures and take InsideHook full steam
   ahead into the world of mobile

Skills &amp; Requirements

Qualifications:

   - A track record of writing custom web applications
   - Proven experience with the following technologies:
      - PHP (5.3 and higher)
      - git
      - PHP (H)MVC Framework like Kohana, Zend, or Symfony using an ORM
      - HTML
      - LESS CSS
      - JavaScript &amp; jQuery
      - MySQL (5.x and higher)
      - JSON
      - nginx (1.x and higher)
      - Capistrano
      - Shell Scripting
      - Ubuntu Server

Cherries on top:

   - You've written web applications leveraging the Kohana framework
   - Managing these AWS services is second nature to you: EC2, RDS, S3,
   Cloudfront, and IAM
   - Leading the charge on mobile web and app development excites you
   - Resolving issues in JIRA brings a certain satisfaction to your life
