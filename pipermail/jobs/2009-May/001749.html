<PRE>Hello All,
&#160;
Greetings, I am seeking full time PHP/MYSQL employment. I am an expert PHP/MYSQL developer, I have designed applications from scratch, have improved applications, and basically, PHP is my second language.. I have a love for PHP/MYSQL and overall coding and programming.&#160;&#160;I'd love the opportunity to work at any web shop/startup/corporate environment and strut my stuff, and show you I am willing to go the extra mile, and get the job done. 
&#160;
&#160;
I am available immediately, but please if you are a recruiter only contact me if you have a good client relationship and are looking for someone to help close the deal, because I would like to hit the ground running.
&#160;
My resume is below, I have excellent references, and code samples in my arsenal to send.
&#160;
I can start immediately.
&#160;
&#160;

 &#160; 
Objective: Expert Level PHP/MYSQL Web Developer 
 &#160; 
 &#160; 
I believe when employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate. This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me extraordinary is that I do something that others don&#8217;t, I go the extra mile. I am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff. 
 &#160; 
Throughout the years I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years, designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there are two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work for their career.. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many talents and creativity to your position. Consider me for your position because unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in
 first place.
