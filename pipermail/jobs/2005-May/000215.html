<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Be a part of a new generation of online business promotion. Link Experts 
is a cutting edge Internet marketing company ready to explode onto the 
rapidly growing online media space. We have a successfully tested 
service, and a dynamic winning management team. We are looking for an 
experienced software developer to join our team.

This position is fulltime, onsite in our Manhattan offices.  We are 
looking for people with full-time, commercial experience in Linux, PHP, 
MySQL and Apache.

Please respond by email to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at linkexperts.com</A> with your resume in 
plaintext format only, (no MSWord, PDF, URLs, etc.), along with a cover 
letter describing how your skills and experience match the following:

Requirements:
  - 2 to 5 years of commercial experience coding PHP in a Linux environment
  - Strong understanding and coding experience with the Object-Oriented 
features of PHP, especially the new features in PHP5
  - Strong experience and understanding of relational databases.  This 
is not the same as writing SQL.  You should understand what makes a good 
relational db design.  Specific knowledge of MySQL is preferred.  Oh, 
and you should be able to write SQL as well.
  - Excellent communication skills.  This is for real, not just thrown 
in to make this posting look impressive.  If you can't communicate your 
ideas and objections clearly and persuasively, how can anyone learn from 
all the wonderful things you know?
  - Strong knowledge of ego-less programming

Very Desirable:
  - Knowledge of Apache's more interesting features and how they apply 
to PHP and web development
  - Knowledge of XML and Web Services
  - Experience using CVS or Subversion in the development of PHP sites.
  - Knowledge of basic Linux system administration.
  - Not being afraid of telling your boss how their ideas are wrong (if 
you know how to do it right).


Compensation:

First 2-6 months: 400 a week + accelerated stock options
Subsequently: 40,000 yearly plus incentives &amp; benefits

This is an opportunity to work in a highly talented &amp; fast paced 
environment with enormous longterm upside.

Apply to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at linkexperts.com.</A>

Principals only, please.  No commissions or referral fees will be paid.
This is full-time, on-site only.  No telecommuting.

</PRE>
