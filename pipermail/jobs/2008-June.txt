Message-ID: <20080602115936.G57494@mercury.atopia.net>

Hi everyone,

Looking for a reliable PHP developer with good database skills 
(application is powered by MySQL), with references, to introduce to a 
client of mine.  I have met many people on this list in the past, 
especially at Holiday Parties, so I know the overall work ethic of this 
group.

The job would be working on developing on an already-existing code base 
(making modifications to existing code), though at your recommendations, 
my client may be willing to allow you to redo certain parts of the code 
you feel are ineffecient, as he no longer has contact with the previous 
developer.

You would be consulting for my company spending your time working on my 
client's project.  It would start off as hourly consulting with the 
potential for many more hours and/or full time in the future.

Please email offlist if interested.  A plus if I already know you or 
someone I know knows you.

-Matt

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Off-site PHP & MySQL gig 
Message-ID: <EBB638FBE52A481FA6A6C7D2F5531057@av>

Dear David,

 

I am Vaughn Frost - over 30 years of I.T. experience.  My background spans
multiple companies and multiple engagements both in the United States and
around the world.  Currently, I work from home for a fortune 500 company
performing data architecture services.  While I do not reside in the NYC
area; I do work from home and have the capability for internet meetings and
unlimited phone contact.  Note that in my current full-time job, I perform
Data Architecture work I work from home allowing for meetings with business
owners, logical data modeling, validation, creation of data schemas,
loading, testing, etc.

 

To attempt to identify where I would match your needs, I perform Business
Analysis to glean logical data structures.  I do this via the Erwin data
modeling toolset.  Once the key logical concepts are determined and
validated (to the business rules/requirements), I create the MySQL design
based upon those business rules and other underlying data architecture
concepts.  With that completed, the process of designing the application
begins.  The concept is to follow the DBMS structures with the application
code to create a system that encompasses all current business needs with an
eye on growth potential.  That potential being available in a DBMS that is
properly designed to accommodate such growth without costly application code
re-writes.

 

I have worked extensively to develop a recent Content Management System for
Vuria in North Scottsdale, AZ (www.vuria.com <http://www.vuria.com/> ).
Most recently I developed a manufacturing system using the LAMP solution.
Please understand that data-driven design and proper systems
design/implementation is my passion.  I perform the same type of activities
in my regular 'day-job'; but, within the DB2 and Postgres areana. 

 

My preferred method of data-driven design is via the Erwin toolset.
Additionally, utilize my CodeCharge product to perform application
development (MySQL/PHP) in 1/3 the time of normal coding methods.  The
generated code is modified slightly with available 'exits' to allow for
any/all application needs.  It is my experience that the resultant code is
very error free and very reliable.  I have developed dozens of applications
and web-sites with this tool.

 

As you can see by my statements later in this email; I am a proponent of
data-driven design.  That is, the emphasis I use is on the 'data' initially.
When the navigation rules and business user interface needs are identified,
the underlying data design will flow and allow for smooth application
coding.

 

I have implemented some internal business MySQL/PHP solutions over the past
several years - of which the most recent was for a manufacturing process.
The MySQL version used was 4.1 using multiple engines (INNODB and MYISAM).
I elected to not use referential integrity (FK constraints); however, the
system could use them with no issues.  Some of the key elements I looked for
and designed were:

1)       Separation of information into 3NF (3rd Normal Form) so that
repetition and duplication is handled logically.

2)       Creation of underlying code/reference tables that drive attributes
of the system design (e.g. Color Codes for electrical wiring)

3)       Use of link names for large objects (e.g. *.jpg files) such that
MySQL queries can locate the jpg to be displayed without burdening the MySQL
database with the large object item itself.  That is, the jpg files are
actually stored in a separate folder on the Linux file system.

4)       Allow for dynamic upload of new images with automatic naming.

5)       Architecturally:

a.       Design reference/code tables (at a minimum) to allow for deletion
'flags' instead of physical delete; therefore, allowing the application to
utilize old code values on display but not for new instances of code usage.


b.       Limit the number of rows in tables for key application data needs
by creating 'inactive' prefixed tables and logic to offload
unused/inactivated information on an ongoing basis (part of application
design)

6)       Create indexing schemes for each table to accommodate complex MySQL
queries (joins and where clause use).

7)       Develop a backup/recovery plan (Data Continuity) to minimize (or
eliminate) any potential data loss from any hardware/network issue.

Hello everyone. I am a Partner with a recruiting firm named Winter, Wyman & Co., and I'm working with one of the largest advertising firms in the world to find two talented PHP developers to join their growing Digital Media team. I've recently placed the first member of their PHP development group and he is loving the environment so far. The ideal candidate will have experience designing/building PHP back-ends to connect with Flash-based, Rich Media front-ends. Anyone with formal Actionscript development experience is highly preferred. You don't need to have experience working in an agency environment, but that also would be a plus. The culture and benefits at this firm are one of their greatest strengths, including some ridiculous holiday schedules for the summer! I've got a salary range of 90-120 DOE. Resumes can be forwarded to my attention and all inquiries will be handled with the utmost confidentiality.

 

Thanks.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] 2 PHP Team Lead openings in NYC


Hello everyone. I am a Partner with a recruiting firm named Winter,
Wyman & Co., and I'm working with one of the largest advertising firms
in the world to find two talented PHP developers to join their growing
Digital Media team. I've recently placed the first member of their PHP
development group and he is loving the environment so far. The ideal
candidate will have experience designing/building PHP back-ends to
connect with Flash-based, Rich Media front-ends. Anyone with formal
Actionscript development experience is highly preferred. You don't need
to have experience working in an agency environment, but that also would
be a plus. The culture and benefits at this firm are one of their
greatest strengths, including some ridiculous holiday schedules for the
summer! I've got a salary range of 90-120 DOE. Resumes can be forwarded
to my attention and all inquiries will be handled with the utmost
confidentiality.
 
Thanks.
 
Mike

I'm doing some recruiting/networking for a local internet technology firm. But not just ANY internet technology firm. It's a group of innovators: art directors, developers, industrial designers, interactive artists, animators and more. At its core, the work is a creative, artistic enterprise. But we strive for the perfect marriage of creative and technology, with interactivity as their canvas. We've found international fame with our uniformly compelling and innovative web projects in the past few years. We make websites. Viral marketing. Television spots. Software. Interactive Films. Even Installation art. In fact, we've received critical acclaim for some of our more well-known installation art work. In a different twist on interactive art, we recently completed our first foray into interactive software as art. Our next goal is a bit less "creative", but no less important: to hire some terrific web developers to join our NYC, Boston & San Francisco offices. Working for ad agencies 
and big brands, you'll often have to develop within existing infrastructures, so a variety of skills are needed. The ideal candidate will be at home in a multi-disciplinary environment, working on an interesting array of ecclectic projects with tight deadlines and being part of the creative process. The ideal person will have 3-5 years' experience with 2 or 3 of the following: Ruby on Rails, PHP, .Net, Cocoa/Obj-C; 3 - 5+ years' experience doing Web work; and advertising/brand experience is always a plus. Does this sound like an interesting gig to you? If so, drop me a line at CarolMTaylor at comcast.net, along with your resume--- and we'll take it from there.

Message-ID: <C0A5E31718FC064A91E9FD7BE2F081B1017044E7@exchange.gridapp.com>

-Summary-
? 
You'll work closely with other developers throughout the requirements, design, and implementation phases of web-based front-end projects. Ideally, you'll offer copious amounts of object-oriented PHP experience (framework independent) in a LAMP environment which will include JavaScript, XML/XSLT, CSS, and SQL experience. Naturally since we all have to get along, you're also a great communicator with techies and non-techies. 


-Us-

GridApp Systems really is the leading developer of database management automation software (http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Database/GridApp-Takes-ModelDriven-Approach-to-Database-Automation/). The front-end of Clarity is heavy on object-oriented PHP while the server side focuses on object-oriented Perl 5.8.7. We're very programmer casual and team-oriented. Our CEO was previously a CTO and brought with him several of his trusted cohorts when they started GridApp. We are both venture funded and profitable.


-Responsibilities-

Work effectively with product management and technical leads to understand and define requirements

Create written design specifications, which ensure that the software fits into our overall scalable architecture, addresses requirements, and is testable

Code in PHP and JavaScript applying object oriented development principles, cleanly separating logic from content

Provide and then meet time commitments for development projects

Communicate status and issues orally and in writing in a timely manner


-Minimum qualifications-

5+ years experience with PHP writing robust software systems

3+ years experience with JavaScript/AJAX; XML/XSLT; SQL; CSS

Bonus points for PostgreSQL, Smarty templates

Very strong understanding of object oriented systems and UI design principles is required

Familiarity with major databases (Oracle, MS SQL Server) is a plus.

Excellent written and oral communications skills are required

Thrive in a deadline-driven, fast-paced team environment

College degree isn't required since so many of our developers have their PhD from the School of Hard Knocks 


-Send resume or just inquire-

Message-ID: <00d201c8d224$a8d758c0$fa860a40$@com>

Hello,

I'm looking for a CSS/HTML expert that can take an existing site and rebuild
the CSS/HTML so that it's clean and reusable.  We'll then use the new
front-end code base to develop additional, similar sites, and at some point
redo the original site.

Some graphics will be required, such as creating logos and layout images
from the layouts we've been provided.

Must be comfortable working on a Unix server and work reliably.

Folks in NYC are preferred but not a requirement.

Please contact me off-list with work you've done and resume.

Time is of the essence - no staffing agencies.

Exciting Startup in Manhattan seeking a sharp, highly experienced, and self-directed PHP Developer / Team Lead!

 

Are you tired of working for a big corporation that doesn't encourage your innate technical creativity, and fails to reward your hard work? Join a fun, young group of men and women who have co-founded a successful startup based in Manhattan, that is already producing revenue.

Ideal candidates will know how to build a scalable, secure website, with a creative streak to think up new functionality for our web product. The work hours are intense, but so is the payoff in the end.  Exceptional communication and leadership skills are a must, as you must lead the web development as we continue to grow. As the sole PHP Developer, you work well on your own, and have the confidence and technical experience to build up a team.  


 

QUALIFICATIONS
- Extensive OOP PHP and MySQL programming capabilities REQUIRED

- Comfort with CSS and HTML/XHTML

- Drupal CMS a plus

- Knowledge of AJAX, JavaScript, XML is a plus

- Authorization to work in US with any employer (Sorry, sponsorship is not available)

- B.S. in Computer Science

- 4+ years professional experience. Will consider 0-4 years experience if you have been coding since you were a kid, and have solid internship experience or equivalent background.

 

Benefits include Tuition Reimbursement!  Please send a resume and brief cover letter to sfehser at winterwyman.com.  Potential candidates will be selected based upon skills and experience, as well as enthusiasm and the ability to articulate why you'd be the perfect candidate for this small and unique startup!
