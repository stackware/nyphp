<PRE>The Internet is a big, busy place, and we at Yahoo! are proud to stand
out in the crowd. As the world's number one Internet brand, servicing
over a half billion people, we're determined to maintain our commitment
to delivering news, entertainment, information and fun... each and every
day. 

In order to maintain our position as one of the world's most trafficked
Internet destinations, we're always on the lookout for people with big
ideas and big talent to help us provide our visitors with the innovative
products and services they've come to expect from Yahoo!. We're looking
for people like you. 

How Big Can You Think? 

Do you refuse to take things for granted, preferring instead to subject
hypotheses and opinions to scientific tests? Do you like figuring out
what the right questions are, and designing the most efficient and
comprehensive ways of generating meaningful answers to them
automatically? The Yahoo! Search and Advertising, Metrics and Analysis
group is seeking an experienced software engineer to join its Automated
Metrics and Process Tools team (AMPT). We're passionate about building
the best search engine on the planet, and our team brings together some
of the best and brightest minds from across the search industry. Our
product now powers hundreds of millions of queries a day, and the AMPT
team plays a key role in informing decisions about its direction. As
part of the team, you will be responsible for designing and implementing
automated processes for measuring Search Engine performance. You will
work with the Relevance Tools, Analysis, International and other Yahoo!
Search Technology teams to help maximize the efficiency of our
development and testing processes. You will play an important part in
the design and building of systems that measure our product's
performance and compare us to our competitors. 

Essential Responsibilities 
Collaborate across Yahoo! Search development groups to help define
meaningful Web Search product metrics and design processes that generate
them automatically and reliably. Develop robust database applications
with a strong web-based UI component that tell the product's story,
summarizing complicated metrics in clear and meaningful ways. Generate
metrics based on internally-produced data and on feeds of external panel
data. Effectively design, develop, and deploy tools and applications
based on open-source technologies such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl and
PHP. Diagnose causes of abnormal data spikes. 

Minimum Job Qualifications 

* Proven industry experience that includes building tools for use by
development teams. 
* Demonstrable expertise in Object Oriented Perl. 
* Experience in building web-based tools, using PHP, JavaScript and/or
Perl. 
* Experience in building database applications on Unix/Linux platforms. 
* Experience in the design and implementation of automated production
and/or testing systems. 
* Outstanding track record of teamwork and excellent communication
skills. 

Preferred Job Qualifications 

* BS in Computer Science (or equivalent experience). 
* 5+ years of industry experience that includes building tools for use
by development teams. 
* Search Engine/Information Retrieval experience. 
* Background in statistics and/or data mining. 
* Experience with MySQL. 
* Experience in data modeling. 
* Java and/or C/C++ programming experience.
