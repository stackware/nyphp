<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Ning, Inc. in Palo Alto, CA is looking for Application Developers to
join our team.  Ning is an online platform for creating your own social
networks for anything. The company was founded by Marc Andreessen and
Gina Bianchini and currently hosts over 235,000 social networks, growing
at over 1,000 per day. In fact, Ning powers the largest number of social
networks on the Internet. We also just raised another $60 million
dollars at a $500M pre-money valuation and are featured in this month's
Fast Company (see article
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/125/nings-infinite-ambition.html?pa">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/125/nings-infinite-ambition.html?pa</A>
ge=0%2C4&gt; ).  Ideally, we would relocate you to beautiful Northern
California, but the right people can work remotely (and plan on visiting
us on a regular basis).

 

The Group:

Our Application Developer group is a small, flat organization populated
with people who are passionate about creating beautiful software used by
millions of people in their daily lives.  We use PHP and Javascript on
top of the Ning Platform REST APIs to deliver an extremely friendly and
infinitely customizable experience to Network Creators on Ning.  

 

Responsibilities

*           Play a key role in designing new features (that will be used
by millions of people), and generating ideas for updates and
development, often in 2-4 week cycle times. 

*           Ability to work with other teams - such as design and
product management - but also work independently; having ownership of
projects concerning features for networks on Ning.

*           Work on both front-end features - like photo sharing, video
sharing, events, discussions, and blogs - as well as continuously
optimizing the back-end infrastructure to increase performance at
rapidly increasing levels of scale.

 

Requirements

*           BS/MS in CS or equivalent experience. 

*           Experience with PHP, AJAX, and HTML/CSS. 

*           Java or C++ or object oriented design experience.

*           Experience programming scalable web applications.

*           Knowledge of web services, and agile development
methodologies desired. 

*           Know your way around Flash. 

*           Curiosity. You've created a social network on Ning. You dive
into a bit more detail and are struck by the Ning Content Store and why
we chose that architecture. You have lots of technical questions for us.

 

Send me an email if interested.  Check out www.ning.com
