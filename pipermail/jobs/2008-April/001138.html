<PRE>We are looking for an additional MVC/PHP programmer to work in conjunction
with another freelance (not side by side, but on different projects
simultaneously). Our website is www.tungstenproperty.com &#8211; we need someone
to help us:

 1. Add/change various features to the Public Site - Specifically speeding
up the General Uploading and Rendering of the site, its annoying slow at
timeso compared to our competiors and we seem to have trouble finding
someone that can help diagnose the problem.  Additionally, we would like to
structure a new sub template that allows sub domain pages to be easily
integrated into the main site with basic HTML coding.  Intergration of
Google Maps into the site.  Long term we need to work on a more robust
search/sort system.  We are looking for something very simple and fast to
navigate, any proposals would be welcome.
 2. Maintain and improve our current multi-user (user friendly) database,
which is based on a series of the language based below (I am
 not sure which one myself) - Including expanding number of out source
locations via RSS and other custom scripts, implementing an email blast
system to a list we have  improving general speed and usability of YUI
interface, configuring searchable, interfirm, user friendly DB for listings
to be sorted/saved

Requirements:
* You should have considerable experience with PHP and with MYSQL, LAMP
stack
* You should be able to work with and adjust to other peoples code. We have
heard that our code is fairly &quot;clean&quot;, however I am not a programmer and
imagine this more a matter of opinion than fact.  Nevertheless, you will
have to work on top of someone elses work in many cases.
* You must be VERY reachable; we have had the unfortunate experience of not
being able to contact our programmers for days on end &#8211; it's ok if you are
busy/away/unavailable, it is just important for you to let us know.
* You must be able to keep deadlines, this means, you set realistic
deadlines for yourself, which we will expect you to uphold, and that you
have the discipline to keep them. If you like, you can provide us with
references that highlight your ability to do this.  We are interested in a
pay structure that rewards speed and execution.  For instance - if you quote
a project for three days and $100, we will pay you $120 if complete in two
days, $90 if you complete in 4 days, $80 if you complete in 3 days, etc.  We
are open to any creative structure you may suggest as well.
* A professional/diligent attitude to work without losing your creative
ability.
* Languages (if you don't know every single one it can probably still be
figured out):
 &#183; PHP5
 &#183; PEAR
 &#183; MVC
 &#183; YUI (Yahoo UI)
 &#183; OOProgramming (Basics)
 &#183; CakePHP Framework
 &#183; Apache 1.3/2.0
 &#183; MySQL 4/5
 &#183; Subversion
 &#183; Linux Administration
 &#183; SSH
 &#183; ImageMagik
 &#183; HTML / CSS / Javascript

If you are interested in this position please reply with resume/portfolio
and general hourly rate to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">dooleytj+np at gmail.com</A> &lt;dooleytj%<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">2Bnp at gmail.com</A>&gt;

Thanks.
