<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>A company based out Clark, New Jersey is seeking a fulltime Sr. PHP 
developer. 

The company is a very flat organization. You would be reporting to the 
Director of IT and would be the PHP SME within the organization.  They are 
currently hiring at the rate of one employee a month...so the organizaiton 
is expanding and obviously your role would increase as well. 

They are more of a product company then a software solution firm.  This is 
not so much developing websites as working on on content.  They are 
migrating their front end from AJAX to PHP.  Hence the need. 

We know the president/founder of the company.  He used to be the Sr. 
executive at our firm.  Our CEO and him still are very good friends. Thus, 
the resume is going to be looked at if we send it over. 

What they do develop a Mobile Messaging Product  on an Enterprise Level. 
Currently working with some big accounts. 

Understanding Content Managment System seems to be curical.   Joomla is a 
slam dunk ...perhaps Drupal.  Something similar. 

The Linux is not that big of a deal. being comfortable in Linux is ideal. 

The salary is $60,000 to I would say as high as $80,000.  The higher you 
go the more transparent it has to be about added benefit of highering 
you...ie. if you had developed products,  or 4 continous years of PHP  or 
Joomla -content management Expert. 

Requirements include:

&#8226; A strong knowledge of PHP with 2-4 years of experience

&#8226; An understanding of Open Source Applications; specifically Joomla.

&#8226; Know how to set up and configure a variety of Linux distributions

&#8226; Be able to setup and configure Apache and Tomcat server configurations

&#8226; Have a basic understanding of JavaScript

&#8226; Be very detail oriented and be able to handle many assignments at the 
same time

&#8226; Have a strong knowledge of HTML

&#8226; Be able to research functional capabilities

&#8226; Have an understanding of web graphics and design

&#8226; Fast learner

&#8226; Ability to work in a dynamic, fast-paced, energetic, team-oriented 
environment
Please be prepared to show examples of PHP work that you have done.
Benefits:

&#8226; Medical &amp; dental benefits
&#8226; Company matched retirement plan
&#8226; Opportunity for growth


Call me with any questions 732-744-3119 and send me the e-mail.
