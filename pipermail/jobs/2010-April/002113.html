world. 

LimeWire prides itself on its great products, one of the most engaged user
bases in the world, and an incredible team of talent.  Since launching the
LimeWire application in 2000, we have continuously sought ways to empower

While we work hard, we always have time for a board game, a round of
poker, or a break on our garden roof deck.

Interested in LimeWire?  We look forward to hearing from you.
