<PRE>Happy Spring folks,

Job market is picking up.

This is a very hot position with a company I've gotten to know quite well.


Privately held e-commerce company with a strong international business 
model is seeking an exceptional LAMP Architect/Developer to lead a small 
team of developers in the ongoing development and expansion of the 
software that drives their profitable business. Their websites receive 
millions of page impressions per day, are highly scalable and built 
using advanced techniques.

This is a senior role on their team.

They are located in the Union Square district of  NYC. It is a relaxed 
environment in an international company. They've experience massive 
growth of the past three years and it is continuing.

Excellent benefits.

They want this person to have the following skills

- significant experience as an architect and developer on *high-traffic, 
highly-scalable community sites* using object oriented PHP.
- experienced with SQL queries of &quot;thought-provoking complexity&quot;.
- strong experience with the full web development toolkit.
- experience working with web services and integrating feeds from third 
party entities as a developer and architect.
- experience working with memory caching techniques.
- ability to lead a small development team.
- aware of web standards, their purpose, benefits and appropriateness 
along with exposure to potential issues that will arise.
- comfortable and experienced working in a small Agile team.
- experience working in an e-commerce oriented environment.
- fluent in English.

Salary, very much depending on experience and skills, is up to $125K + 
bonus.

Referrals appreciated.
Please reply off list to me.

Thanks.
Art
