<PRE>Hi,

I launched a startup last year as a site for Do It Yourselfers to connect with one another around sharing pictures of their DIY projects.  The site is growing and a major redesign of the business model and UI is in the works (contact me for a preview).  Because of crawler/privacy reasons with other people working on this startup, I'm not posting the URL here, but it shouldn't be hard to find, or contact me for more info.

I'm a business development / marketing guy.  I've had failure and success with other startups, including selling my last.  I'm president of the graduating class of a very selective tech incubator, the Founder Institute in NYC (<A HREF="http://www.founderinstitute.com">http://www.founderinstitute.com</A>) and I am active in NYC-area tech scene.

I'm looking for a technical lead for my startup with the potential for that role to turn into a cofounder position.  You must be ambitious, nimble, know all of the latest web technologies, creative, and, oh yeah, a kick-ass programmer.  You should recognize that a beautiful and efficient UI is just as important as the features behind it (not all agree on this) (my startup is NOT this way now and it's a problem I'm working on).  Working with a startup means late nights, acting fast, adjusting based on real data findings, and staying innovative.  If you are looking for stability, this is the not the environment for you.  In fact, most startups fail.  But, the right team makes all the difference and I'm determined to build that team.  If you're looking for an opportunity to make something great and touch peoples' lives, this is for you.  If you have the drive to change the world and the technical chops to do it, contact me now (bonus points of you encounter
lots of naysayers).  Looking for someone that can push the limits of technology and engagement.  This startup is my latest endeavor, but it's sure to lead to more.

Please tell me a little about yourself and send any examples of your work. 

Thanks,
Aaron
