We are looking for a developer/programmer that is rock solid in PHP code. Our Company is located in the flat iron area of New York City. We are a funded startup in the relationship/social media space that launched at TechCrunch 50 this past September. We currently employ one full time developer but are looking to bring an additional developer on part time to write code for new features on the site as well as to help fix bugs in the current code base. The site is built on the Zend framework using doctrine and is coded in php.

Although the position is part time, there is also the possibility of full time employment. This Company is on the brink of some exciting milestones so this is a great opportunity to get on board a young startup as it starts to grow. In addition to having a solid programming background, candidates should also be seeking a truly entrepreneurial environment and have a passion for what they do. You must also be located in the Tri-state area as we are not looking to outsource this position. Please send me an e-mail if you are interested or would like to learn more about this position.

Message-ID: <6A50D538-C356-44F5-94EE-55F162A0F279@fastmail.fm>

Hello,

Looking for a detailed estimate for site development.  Wireframes are here to clarify the site's scope (please do not distribute):

http://perrygarvin.com/temp/client_wireframes.pdf

A few notes:

- ExpressionEngine preferred but open to open source solutions.  Please specify.

- A huge part of this project is the flexible presentation of date- and time-based information: the films!  Films may span days, play on single days, or on various days.  Times, however, will be the same for every film date.  See wireframes for the different ways films need to be presented.  The back-end interface for the webmaster must be intuitive and easy to use.  We've looked at this module for ExpressionEngine whose interface we like: http://www.solspace.com/software/detail/calendar/

- Other key features include: video embedded with capability for full-screen, modal image popups (Lightbox), JavaScript slideshows, iCal integration, RSS feed of films and events, podcast.

- Client gets about 3,000,000 visitors a year and plans to increase the amount of video it delivers.  With the new site launch, we are expecting larger site growth.  Site should be accessible and optimized for mobile devices (iPhone, Android) but compatibility with Firefox 2+, Safari 2+, IE 7+ is required.  No Flash.

- There is no e-commerce functionality.  All e-commerce is handled by another site.  There will be integration required for email newsletter subscription (likely through ConstantContact or MailChimp).

- The deadline for launch is September 6, 2010.  Wireframes (attached) are not final but 90% there. We need to go through design (expected to be completed July 12, 2010).  We need you to be around for bug-squashing for 90 days after launch.

Two estimates please:

Estimate 1: Front-end programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) & Back-end development

Estimate 2: Just back-end development

Please send samples of past work equivalent to this project.
