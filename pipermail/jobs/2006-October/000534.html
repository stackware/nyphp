<PRE>Schematic, one of the nation's leading interactive agencies, is seeking
a world-class PHP Senior Software Developer to join our New York team.

Headquartered in Los Angeles with offices in New York and Atlanta, we
provide award-winning user interface, design and technology solutions
for the Web, advanced devices and television. Schematic develops across
a wide array of platforms including set-top boxes, game consoles, mobile
devices, and the internet. We have recently developed projects with EA,
Microsoft, Amp'd, Comcast, Fox, Intel, Motorola, and MTV, among others.

Senior Software Developers lead and work with project teams to
architect, design, and develop web and other applications. Ideal
candidates will have a minimum of five years experience creating
large-scale web applications with PHP and MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Experience with PHP 5 and object-oriented PHP is required, and you must
be able to architect complex applications, write well-structured
classes, and have a solid working knowledge of inheritance, interfaces,
design patterns, MVC, XML, templating, caching, sessions, authentication
and abstraction.

You must also be comfortable working from the Unix command line and with
Apache, and should be familiar with team-based production scenarios,
using CVS or subversion and bug reporting tools such as Mantis. An
excellent grasp of SQL is a must, and you should have experience
administering relational databases, as well as creating and maintaining
sophisticated databases and tables, and handling database transactions.


Responsibilities:

     * Participation in all aspects of the development life cycle
(design, implement, test, document, and deploy)

     * Maintain high standards of quality for code, documentation, and
deliverables

     * Work with project managers and development teams to create
timelines/schedules

     * Interact with business teams and clients to provide technical
expertise and feedback

     * Evaluate new technologies/tools as needed

     * Mentor junior developers

     * Maintain and update codebases for legacy applications

     * Clearly communicate technical ideas and decisions to both
technical and non-technical audiences


Pluses:

     * Experience with other languages (Perl, Java, Ruby, ActionScript,
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, XML/XSL, etc.)

     * Experience with quality assurance and release management

     * Experience with formal software development lifecycles (SDLC)

     * Experience building/maintaining e-commerce-oriented applications

     * Experience building scalable applications able to stand up to
hundreds of millions of page views per month

     * Experience implementing various scalability techniques, such as
data caching (memcache, ramdisk storage), data denormalization, etc.

     * Experience with Oracle, specifically, authoring of PL/SQL

     * Experience using MySQL with InnoDB tables; use of database
transactions

     * Experience with data model design, including use of foreign keys,
indexes, check constraints, and cascading deletes

     * Experience with MySQL 5.x, specifically using stored procedures
and triggers

     * Experience and general knowledge of Unix-based systems/network
administration (load balancers, DNS, TCP/IP, etc.)

     * Experience compiling and configuring Apache, PHP and MySQL

     * Unit testing with PHPUnit2; test-driven development


Applicants should email resumes to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobsny at schematic.com.</A> Please
