Director, Right Media


---Company Overview---

Right Media helps advertisers, ad networks and publishers trade online media
more efficiently. While each solution is customized to fit a client's needs,
the core is always the same. Every participant on Yield Manager, our ad
management platform, buys or sells each individual impression dynamically in
the first open exchange for online media (one of our businesses, the RM Ad
Network, is one of those participants).

Right Media has built the online advertising industry&#185;s first open media
exchange. All buyers and sellers in the exchange are interconnected on a
common platform, have equal access to media and trade it seamlessly. It&#185;s a
new vision for the most competitive space in the world right now.

The exchange and our media network (one of its thousands of participants)
are growing fast. Advertisers, publishers and ad networks trade over two
billion impressions in the exchange daily. We need more forward-thinking
media pros who can keep up.
