<PRE>
LDG Media LLC, a small Web Design/Internet Application firm seeks an
intermediate-level PHP programmer for temporary work on a specific project
for a period of 2 - 3 weeks starting as soon as possible. You must be able
to work ON SITE at least 2 or 3 days a week in our TriBeCa/Chinatown office
in lower Manhattan. Additional hours may be required which could be
performed off site. We anticipate ongoing work would be available after this
initial project is complete.

The candidate will primarily be responsible for working on an existing
PHP/MySql web-based digital asset management application.

The ideal candidate should have professional web-development experience
working with commercial clients. They should have experience in a
collaborative working environment and have extensive experience with PHP and
MySql.

In addition to the main requirements of solid PHP/MySql skills are: good
XHTML/JavaScript knowledge, the ability to follow instructions, pay
attention to detail and QA your work.

The current position is part-time, which MAY develop into full-time. There
might also be an opportunity to work more than 30 hours per week depending
on our job load and your availability.

You must be:
Highly proficient in PHP, MySql and HTML. Knowledge of JavaScript and CSS
required. Bottom line is clean code and attention to detail. Experience
and/or interest in digital asset management and photography would be a plus.

Excellent opportunity to work with web professionals with many years
experience in the web design industry as well as work on an exciting
proprietary web application.
