Mr. PHPJobz,

If it's not on this list, then go away.


And everyone,

This list isn't a place for recruiters to "sell" people.

Follow these guidelines or we will moderate this list - very strictly:

-- If you have a specific open position, recruiters included, then you are
welcome to post it.

-- If you are an individual looking for work, then you are welcome to post
your availability.

-- No noise, rants, phishing - Nothing else.

	Social Technologies ($1k referral bonus!)
Message-ID: <CA+3bYn=qdLOpXOx9vyayO-C448Rqw6xSuUh14sjk4Pu_zdSTHg@mail.gmail.com>

Affinitive (www.beaffinitive.com), a Facebook Preferred Developer
Consultant (PDC), is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join
our development team and work on fun, innovative projects in the
social media space leveraging best-of-breed technologies, APIs, and
frameworks for major brands. This is a full-time, on-site position.

We like to keep things agile and develop iteratively, using
test-driven development and continuous integration. We whiteboard
ideas when possible versus preparing 50-page detailed specs.

~ Requirements ~

* 4+ years experience working with modern web frameworks, social APIs,
object-oriented PHP and JavaScript, and HTML/css
* Must be comfortable with unit testing, profiling and optimizing
code, databases, and other services for quality, performance, and
scalability
* Knowledge of a "NoSQL" database (MongoDB, CouchDB, etc) as well as
strong relational database knowledge is a big plus
* Experience working in an agency-based environment (interfacing with
non-technical staff and clients) is a HUGE plus

Most importantly, you need to be someone who is innovative,
collaborative, inquisitive, and confident (but not cocky), able to
meet deadlines, and have a 'do whatever it takes' attitude to your
work. We have a great office jukebox, so having a good taste in music
is also a big plus!

~ Compensation and Benefits ~

* Competitive salary, commensurate with experience
* Great benefits including full medical and dental coverage and 401(k)
* Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
* A great work environment!

~ Interested? ~

Please drop us a line at engineer[at]beaffinitive.com. Be sure to
include links to relevant projects/cool hacks you have worked on as
well as your GitHub profile (if you have one), and your salary
requirements/availability.

We are also offering a $1,000 referral bonus if you pass this along to
anyone we end up hiring!

Message-ID: <CAPgC1EvD91Q0yDVX-LUrtgvsQAjxkUrDAcqPR2BAOT13d_6ZJA@mail.gmail.com>

We are looking for someone that is passionate about coding, and dreams in
code. We are an established multi-million dollar online store, and want to
add another developer to our team. The goal is to redevelop our website from
the ground up to prepare for further growth. However, we will also be doing
work on our current website as well. We are a small team, and work together
very closely. Much of the work will be done through telecommuting.

Requirements:

- Expert level understanding of PHP and MySQL
- Strong experience working on an e-commerce site
- Strong experience of website security (user authentitication, SSL, session
hijacking, etc)
- Good communication skills

Not quite requirements, but big pluses:

- Knowledge of front-end scripting, mark-up and style-sheet languages,
including Javascript, HTML, and CSS
- 3+ years of working with an e-commerce site
- Experience managing a LAMP environment (Working knowledge of Nginx another
plus)
- Experience developing payment gateways
- Experience with Zen Cart
- SEO optimization

Perks:

- Great starting salary of 40k - 65k
- Much of the work will be done through telecommuting. We might consider
full-time telecommuting opportunities for exceptional developers (for
instance, a great developer that lives out of state)
- Although we are an established company, our programming team still has the
feel of a startup. We are exclusively focused on good programming rather
than beaurocracy.


What you may find yourself working on:

- Error testing a php class (or maybe developing one from the ground up) to
determine shipping rates for products
- Create a php script which a sales person can upload a csv file to, extract
product and pricing information from the csv file, check the validity of the
products against an existing database, then save the information in a
database that you would create
- Modify the functionality on our website's shopping cart to add a
promotional product depending upon the products already in the cart (the
site is coded in PHP)
- Create a payment gateway to interface with an online payment processor
such as PayPal or Google Checkout.
- Create a database to store product information, and a PHP class to pull
that information according to given parameters (only products in a certain
category, in a given price range, etc)
- Create a user registration system as well as the database to store the
credentials in a secure manner, a password retrieval system, and an
authentication system for validating logins.

If you have a portfolio of work that you can show us, please send it in with
your initial resume. If you can give us access to a usable version of
something you have created it would be great, but a good description of the
project(s) would also suffice. One of the best gauges of your skills is to
understand what you have worked on already.

Web Designer

The Visionlearning project (www.visionlearning.com), a National Science
Foundation and U.S. Department of Education funded science education
website, is currently seeking an experienced Web Designer who will analyze
our current site and work with existing staff to redesign and launch a new
site that better meets our user and staff needs.  Specific activities
include:

.         Thoroughly analyze the existing site to determine strengths and
weaknesses with regard to usability and engagement on both front and back
ends;

.         Interview staff members and review user metrics to determine how
the site is currently used;

.         Develop a new, engaging, and functional design based on these
analyses and discussions with project staff;

.         Work directly with Programmers and Project Managers to implement
the new design in a timely manner.

The project is looking for a significant, long-term commitment from an
experienced web designer who will assist in the management of an extensive
site overhaul. A preliminary list of objectives of this overhaul, with
including deliverables related to this position is available for download at
www.visionlearning.com/objectives.pdf. We envision the position as part time
(~20 hours per week), or contractual with a significant weekly commitment,
with annual compensation in the range of $40-$50K, depending on experience.
The project is headquartered in Manhattan in New York City, and significant
time on site is expected. The position requires extensive web design
experience, the ability to implement designs in HTML/CSS, and the capacity
to work with software developers to integrate these into the current
PHP-based codebase. The position also requires the capacity to integrate
staff needs with user needs into a design that encourages interactivity, as
well as to test and troubleshoot the implementations in current standard
browsers. Knowledge of current new media trends is required, and experience
designing for the college educational sector, particularly for undergraduate
students, is highly desired.

To apply, please send a cover letter, resume, at least two relevant design
samples, and the names of three references to Heather Falconer,
hfalconer at visionlearning.com. Applications received by November 15th will be
given preference.

Visionlearning.com provides high-quality, accessible, educational content in
the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines at
the introductory undergraduate level. Our free materials, targeted to both
students and educators, make available peer-reviewed, bilingual content that
not only explores specific STEM concepts, but examines how we have come to
understand them, the people who have contributed to our understanding, and
the ongoing research that builds our scientific knowledge. By utilizing the
Internet and new media, and incorporating both the history of science and
process of discovery in all of our learning modules, we aim to improve
student understanding of science, promote multi- and inter-disciplinary
teaching, and provide a community foundation for those interested in
improving STEM education.
