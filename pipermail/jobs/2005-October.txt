Hey guys,

I have a client who is in need of an experienced osCommerce programmer. I
would take on this job but as everyone may know osCommerce is a mess and not

does ;)

They currently have 2 changes they want implemented and i dont think they
are that complex but if things go well i am sure it would turn into an
ongoing relationship with them, please email me off list with the subject
osCommerce Job.

Thanks,
