Message-ID: <532176.65162.qm@web44908.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hello All,
?
Greetings, I am seeking full time PHP/MYSQL employment. I am an expert PHP/MYSQL developer, I have designed applications from scratch, have improved applications, and basically, PHP is my second language.. I have a love for PHP/MYSQL and overall coding and programming.??I'd love the opportunity to work at any web shop/startup/corporate environment and strut my stuff, and show you I am willing to go the extra mile, and get the job done. 
?
?
I am available immediately, but please if you are a recruiter only contact me if you have a good client relationship and are looking for someone to help close the deal, because I would like to hit the ground running.
?
My resume is below, I have excellent references, and code samples in my arsenal to send.

Objective: Expert Level PHP/MYSQL Web Developer 
 ? 
 ? 
I believe when employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate. This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me extraordinary is that I do something that others don?t, I go the extra mile. I am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff. 
 ? 
Throughout the years I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years, designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there are two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work for their career.. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many talents and creativity to your position. Consider me for your position because unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in
 first place.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Very, very senior PHP developer wanted
Message-ID: <330532b60905270817n64a1f5a3n6ceb855eb32f1895@mail.gmail.com>

NOTE: CANDIDATES ONLY, NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES PLEASE

Hi everyone,

I'm looking for someone to head my development teams on the PHP side,
and am running out of available candidates to look at. I'm reaching
out to you hoping that some of you are not necessarily actively
looking, but are keeping your eyes open for possible opportunities to
grow, expand and learn.

The official blurb:

JetSetter is aggressively building a software development team in New
York City. If you are a talented, motivated engineer comfortable
across the end-to-end technology stack, we want to talk to you. We?re
a PHP shop, but it?s more important to us that you are versatile
across languages and technologies. Interest in (and, better yet,
experience with) agile methodologies and test driven development is
important to us. We?re building something that needs to scale to
thousands of requests per second, so it?d be good if you had some
experience scaling systems to that level (i.e. caching strategies,
thin server architecture). Parts of our system will probably also
require experience in Joomla!, Javascript, MongoDB, Project Voldemort,
and Amazon?s cloud computing services, so skills in those areas will
not go wasted.

Our offices are in the flatiron area in midtown Manhattan, just a few
blocks from Union Square. Our work environment is casual, fun, and
most importantly free of bureaucracy and overhead. In addition to
competitive compensation, our benefits package includes medical,
dental and prescription drug plans, a 401(K) plan, and more. JetSetter
is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

My summary:

Absolute necessities are PHP5.2+, deep understanding of object
methodologies, experience with MVC frameworks, keen awareness of
design patterns (and when to use them, as well as when not to), a deep
philosophical commitment to the KISS principle, and the crossover
ability to not only design and implement simple, beautiful things that
scale but lead and mentor teams to accomplish those lofty goals.
Equally important is your desire for knowledge and learning, as well
as the uncontrollable urge to share that with others.

This is a ground-up leadership opportunity, where getting in now will
be rewarded as the business grows. We're basically relaunching a
business that has already grown to 130+ people and generated $80M in
annual revenues after only 18 months of operation, by retailing
apparel in the luxury space via curated, tasteful approach. We get to
honor the ages-old preference of web developers and yell "Do over!",
but this time specifically for very high end, exclusive travel. If you
wanted to build your own development organization in a startup that
was willing to challenge common notions of how things are supposed to
be done, then you and I need to talk.

In closing, I was drawn to this opportunity as I can remain
technically involved in implementation, while still being involved in
an executive role. If you are similarly inclined to straddle that
developer/manager fence, then again, you and I need to talk.
