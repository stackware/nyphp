Subject: [nycphp-jobs] [JOB] Software Engineer, NYC | 60-130k
Message-ID: <000e01cc0916$f981b6e0$ec8524a0$@com>

3 Positions Available: Junior, Mid and Senior-level: These are full time,
on-site, salaried Software Engineer (PHP/MySQL) positions paying
$60,000-$130,000 depending on experience + benefits.  No telecommuting
allowed.  US Citizens or Green Card holders only please.  Local candidates
only.  Thank you.

Our New York City client is looking for software engineers with solid
server-side programming experience to develop RESTful APIs that facilitates
the buying and selling of online advertising. Their platform is very
large-scale, globally distributed across 4 data centers, service oriented,
and event-driven. They handle a hundred thousand ad serving requests per
second (100s of billions per month), and respond with very strict latency
requirements. In addition, they transport over 5 TB of data daily (and
growing!), to generate some very sophisticated analytics/optimization that
drive decisions behind the ad-serving process.

Ideal candidates are hands-on and proactive when designing applications, are
good at finding simple solutions to complex problems, and is comfortable
coding off of a problem statement instead of a formal spec.  Their
environment is open, collaborative, and encourages learning.  They release
new code at least once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases
reliability), so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and
confident in your work. You'll immediately see the results of your work and
creativity - as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world at
large. 
 
Requirements: 
* Proficiency in PHP, Java, or Python 
* Experience with server side application development and web-services,
especially REST 
* Experience with MySQL 
* Excellent problem solving skills 
* Strong sense of ownership, urgency and drive

Many talented people commute from NJ to NYC for employment.  Therefore, I'm posting this for those people who are tired of commuting into New York and looking for a good-paying, rewarding job in New Jersey.  I apologize in advance if this is totally off-base, and I'm sure someone will let me know if it is.

As the new CTO, I am charged with invigorating our development group to create a tech-savvy startup environment to create next generation products.  Although ten years old, profitable, and with plenty of money in the bank, we want to rapidly grow the business like a startup, and looking forward to a financial 'event' in about three years (no official promises, though).  Employees will participate in the company's stock-option plan to allow them to participate in the upside of that growth.

Another factor that makes working here so attractive, is knowing that not only are we having fun creating new products, we are also literally making a difference in  the lives of children by helping them improve their reading and writing skills.  This fact has been proven over and over in independent research studies.  So unlike the typical faster-better-cheaper-cool product that maybe searching for a business model, we have a sustainable business with true social benefit.  Today we are serving and helping over 1 million students and teachers that love our products.

We are currently looking for 2 senior level, LAMP architect/developers with strong PHP/MySQL experience.  Our developers handle all aspects of the project from reviewing requirements with the product team, designing the solution, creating the user interface (except the graphics) and the supporting backend code using a light-weight framework that was recently created by us and is being extended as needed.  Being a small team, we look for creativity, self-motivation, and excellent communications skills.  If you fit the bill, want a challenge and corresponding reward, please contact me at the email below.

I look forward to speaking with you about the company and the opportunities here.

Message-ID: <BANLkTin-gfir_LHQnXRvzN-s8i3c6ULOXA@mail.gmail.com>

Etsy currently has a number of positions open in our Brooklyn, NY office. We
use a wide selection of technologies here, but the majority of our site runs
on Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.

We're looking for engineers with a few years of industry experience and who
have faced the challenges involved with running a large-scale web site. It's
likely that you have strong database skills and know your way around PHP,
and have had to run or configure your own servers at some point along the
way. PHP is not the only language you program in.

Working for Etsy's engineering team is awesome. I can say this because I've
been here for a little bit over a year and run one of our engineering teams.
We have a large engineering division that is split into small, functional
teams to Get Real Things Done. Every engineer has access to tools for
monitoring our servers, collecting application metrics, and deploying code.
It's likely that you'd find more freedom here to get your work done than at
any other company you've worked for.

Here are some details about some of currently available roles:

We?re convinced that comprehensive technologies, intelligent mining, personalization techniques, and intuitively designed products will lead us there (not to mention our fantastic creative and editorial team). 

We develop primarily using PHP but are technology agnostic and like to be able to move between languages if necessary.  Above all, we value hackers and creative thinkers who use technology to solve real problems.  We are serious about things like design patterns, architecture, speed/performance, and unit testing.  We like doing things the right way.  Here are some recent examples of things we?ve built:

[JOB] Lead Developer, NYC 

[I had to post this job.  I wish I could take it - sounds awesome!]  

Our client is an ecommerce site with a twist....Not only do they we sell
high-end luxury items in women's fashion, but they do so in a way that
allows the consumer to "bid" on items in an online auction marketplace.
Sort of like a "priceline for the fashion industry".  They are in the final
stages of due diligence with 2 VC firms and will soon have between 750,000
and 1 MM in additional seed funding, not including the angel funding that
has propelled them to this point. The company is just 2 people right now,
but the product has already been built, and they are looking for a CTO /
Lead Developer.  If you've only been out of school for a couple of years,
but have prior startup experience and you're a brilliant developer with an
entrepreneurial spirit, they'd like to hear from you. 

They are a small and nimble team and you will be working very frequently
with the Founders. Their site is written in PHP (+ MySQL) and Node.js (+
Redis). Their eCommerce platform uses the open source framework called
Protean. The version control system is Git so they need someone with
advanced LAMP capabilities / experience and, ideally, some experience with
Node / Redis and Git.  Other skill sets that are helpful: XHTML, CSS3, and
HTML5 (until they hire a Front-end developer); experience working with
third-party APIs including the Facebook platform; Photoshop / Illustrator
capabilities are helpful as well, though they already have a graphic
designer who does amazing UI / design work; leadership skills, but not
afraid to get your hands dirty and do a significant amount of coding;
architect a cloud infrastructure that can scale to billions of hits; and
most importantly: we need someone who believes in the core product, has a
crazy work ethic, and loves the start-up world.
 
* 100-115k salary plus 10-15% equity .
* Results-based workplace with unlimited paid time off. 
* Company-covered health insurance. 
* Reimbursement and time off for professional development and conferences. 
* Open workspace in Union Square! 

To be considered, please submit your resume (in any format) and salary
requirements to Beau J. Gould at opensourcestaffing at gmail.com

Message-ID: <00c301cc1a31$a71654c0$f542fe40$@gmail.com>

[JOB] Sr. Web App Engineer, NYC | 110-130k 

This is a full time, on-site, salaried Sr. Web Application Engineer position
paying $110,000-$130,000 depending on experience + benefits.  No
telecommuting allowed.  US Citizens or Green Card holders only please. Local
candidates only.  Thank you.

Our New York City client is looking for a  Sr. Web Application Engineer to
help build a next-generation transactional system on top of their existing
RESTful API services. They need an efficient and agile engineer who is
motivated by solving interesting technical challenges: building new
front-end applications that allow for efficient buying and selling of online
advertising inventory. This role has the potential to lead to a Team Lead or
Architect role in the future, for the right person.

Our mission is to develop web applications that are easy for our clients to
use. If you know how to write JavaScript that is blazing fast and reusable,
if you obsess over both page generation and page rendering times, and if you
are the best at what you do and interested in working with one of the
smartest engineering teams in the city, you should already be working here. 

The position requires a problem solving mindset as much as it requires web
development skills. The ideal candidate is hands-on when designing
applications and is comfortable coding off of not only a formal spec, but
also a problem statement. We release new code at least once a week (as
continuous deployment actually increases reliability), so you must be both
fast and accurate with your code and confident in your work. You'll
immediately see the results of your work and creativity - as will the rest
of our team, our clients, and the world at large.

Required: 
* 5+ years experience writing production-level HTML, CSS & JS on the
client-side
* 3+ years experience using a scripting language on the server-side
* Proven experience writing fast, scalable code
* Experience consuming APIs
* Experience with writing unit tests within a testing framework
* Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24-7 environment 

Desired: 
* Mastery of at least one JS framework - we use jQuery
* Familiarity with at least one MVC framework - we use Zend Framework for
PHP
* Experience as a (hands on!) team lead or architect 

If you are interested in this job, please submit your RESUME and SALARY
requirements to opensourcestaffing|AT|gmail.com

requirements. In addition, they transport over 5 TB of data daily (and
growing!), to generate some very sophisticated analytics/optimization that
drive decisions behind the ad-serving process.

Ideal candidates are hands-on and proactive when designing applications, are
good at finding simple solutions to complex problems, and is comfortable
coding off of a problem statement instead of a formal spec.  Their
environment is open, collaborative, and encourages learning.  They release
new code at least once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases
reliability), so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and
confident in your work. You'll immediately see the results of your work and
creativity - as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world at
large. 
 
Requirements: 
* Proficiency in PHP, Java, or Python 
* Experience with server side application development and web-services,
especially REST 
* Experience with MySQL 
* Excellent problem solving skills 
* Strong sense of ownership, urgency and drive

This is a great opportunity for an individual contributor, with strong team leadership skills, who is ready to take their career to the next level.  

 

Does this describe you? The ideal candidate is someone who is an active contributor in the open source community, loves to code, and knew at a very young age that they wanted to be a software engineer. You're strong in PHP, but can code in other languages because you consider yourself to be agnostic.


 

This Venture Capital funded startup has about 14 people in NYC and launched one year ago.  They just closed an additional round of funding, and have plans for steady growth.  Development thus far has been outsourced (with a remote team in the US and abroad) and they're ready to bring on board a hands-on developer who, one year from now, will be ready to lead a team of 3 or 4 developers.    


E-commerce is a hot space to be in ....but......why is this startup special?  1.  This company is focused on the largest moving, emerging market in the world.  2.  Great culture, very friendly office, a place where you can brainstorm ideas and solve challenging problems.  3. You can have a real impact, it's an exciting time to join, and lots of new development to be done.

 

Salary is $90,000 plus sizebale equity stake plus full benefits.

 

Shoot me an email or give me a call to learn more about this, or similar opportunities.
