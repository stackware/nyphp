 familiarity with LSOs (Local Shared Objects)

Hi,

I'm looking for a flash developer who can help my team and I run some 
experimental scenarios with Flash (storing of LSOs) and potentially PHP (or 
xhtml) to pass the LSO data back and forth.

Shoot me an e-mail if you have worked with local stored objects in flash.

Thanks

Kevin

Immediately need developers to support a design shop! Looking to develop a long-term relationship with freelance programmers who have the capacity to sit in an office space located in Brooklyn (Dumbo area) on occasion and independently handle programming mainly for projects consisting of PHP, CSS & Javascript and on occasion ActionScript/Python relating to Plone(w/ ZPT).
Hours are flexible and we like to have fun but we are also very serious about the quality of work delivered to the client and meeting deadlines!
Perfect for a full-time freelancer who has been working from their home and is looking to get out of their house every once in awhile.

Looking to interview candidates IN PERSON (New York Metro Area) this week so please submit your RESUME, sample code or websites that you have done. We do not care about good looking websites, the more functionality/programming oriented the better!

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] In Need Of A Marketing Expert
Message-ID: <8d9a4280050708080668497e65@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone, 

i have a client who wishes to retain a marketing expert that can consult 
with us on a few areas of their site. They want to do what they call 
"starter blocks" (look at yahoo.com <http://yahoo.com> see the rectangle 
panels). He wants to have a marketing expert tell him the best ways to place 
them on his site. The blocks he will have will include the following.

1.) Blog
2.) Directory
3.) Submission Pages
4.) SEO Tools Directory
5.) Free SEO Tools

The client would also like advice on thier sales page layout to better 
improve sales. 

The design is currently being developed and once that is done the coding 
will begin. All the marketing expert will be required to do is let us know 
what would be best where, etc..

This is NOT an on-site position, this is a one-time position but the client 
may require furthur work as well.

Please respond to codebowl at gmail.com with the subject Re: Marketing Expert. 
Also please specify your rates.

Message-ID: <20050731153029.GA44429@florian.hastek.net>

Greetings,

My client, a CableTV and Service Provider operating nationally, has
an immediate need for a PHP/MySQL contract developer to create an
in-house web-based application for provisioning of new customers.
The work can probably be done remotely but may require travel to the
operations site in the Midwest in order to properly gather the
initial specifications.

The developer we're looking for must have 4+ years of professional
experience, with significant exposure to development in most of:
services provisioning interfaces, customer support interfaces,
interoperating MySQL or other databases with existing provisioning
systems, database schema design, Network Operations Center / Network
Management Systems applications. Also must have a strong working
understanding of IP Addressing, distributed networks, and ISP
environments. The ideal candidate will already have created a
provisioning application with a database back-end for a service provider.

Please forward your resume and pricing information to voipdev at hastek dot com.

Thank you!
