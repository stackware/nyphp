Message-ID: <CABActuATRgRriJAhojYkV2WH17+zjVwmKvs9d1ozAGmDp2U-Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have over 14 years of experience with PHP/MySQL and I am looking for a
position at a company which would allow for remote work.
If you know of any companies which work with remote employees please let me
know so that I can find out if they have any positions available.

I am currently employed full-time in Boston however I am looking to
relocate away from the city to western mass and there are no php developer
jobs in that area.

Any assistance would be appreciated, you can also see my resume on my site
in both PDF and Word formats

+1 for Stack Overflow Careers.

I don't have any direct experience with a placement from them but
http://www.CyberCoders.com/<http://www.CyberCoders.com/qb.aspx?posId=JRJ-SRFEeng-NY&ad=CSJason.Rodrigues>seems
to have tons of listings for remote work.

Also, www.artlogic.com/careers are almost exclusively staffed by contract,
remote developers.

Best of luck with the relocation.

http://joblighted.com/ does a pretty good job aggregating the job boards
I'd look at.  Our development team is all remote and I have posted our
listings in the past to a few of the boards they aggregate. We've had the
best luck with 37Signals, but we're pretty much an all-ruby shop these
days. Good luck!

I value OSS (Beau's intelligence and country wide contacts) to the NY PHP
list versus

Mr. I'm a Recruiter sitting in Manattan Emailing and Tweeting Mini URLs and
Calling you to psyche you up about JOB STARTUP X ...... just like every
other single person in my call center that found your LinkedIn Profile
........

or skillfully sent a direct email to my email address shortly after I post
a response to a technical question on a ny php list  Saying "a long trail
of google searches, that last list post, many months, and we have finally
found you" ......

The signal is so big out of New York that you can't even hear the noise and
that is due to the fine tuned Park Ave recruiters and prestigious talent
headhunters who commute in from Jamaica in Queens or PATH  filling up your
linkedin inbox overnight.

Anybody want to build a real business or software?  Yeah, I'm tired of the
same lists, what's the point.  Have the company contact me, not the
recruiter.

Ps: contest idea (just like paying to pitch your startup to the not
non-tech guy strolling through the crowd rolling eyes)

... Why can't someone modularize all of these jobs anyway?

Wordpress, Drupal and jquery on dream host isn't a fucking job or skillet.

Recruiters should only recruit talent to where it is needed otherwise they
mostly all in NY are a horrible waste of time.

Seriously: 1 London and UK independent talent / job contact will get you
MORE NYC REAL JOBS than 1000 job posts here, phone calls and Craigslist
combined.

Hey speaking of the uk: Nlp and etc on job posts listing WP experience and
sgfml or whatever facebroke term if they are trying to come across as
experts in their field....
