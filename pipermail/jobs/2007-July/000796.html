<PRE>Hi everybody

My company is looking to hire another PHP developer. We develop and maintain
workforce applications (hiring consultants, timesheet tracking, staffing
vendor management, rate and salary benchmarking, etc). The applications are
currently written in ASP, ASP.NET &lt;<A HREF="http://asp.net/">http://asp.net/</A>&gt; and PHP4 (but we're
slowly making our way to transitioning to 5).

We're looking for someone that knows their PHP. It'd be nice if you were
handy with CSS and XHTML as well, as that's always needed. Experience with
Oracle is good too, since that is our database of choice.

This would be a permanent job, with salary and benefits and all the other
good things that come with permanency.

The office is located on Park Ave and 34th St, the company is nextSource and
the website is <A HREF="http://www.nextsource.com">http://www.nextsource.com</A>

Feel free to contact me off-list with any questions, or you can just go
ahead and submit your resume to the e-mail below.

Thanks a lot, and I hope to be working with you soon.
