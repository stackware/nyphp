forward to finding the talent we're looking for.

Hiring Talented Developers. Period.
We've gotten to where we are today by employing the most intelligent and
passionate people we can find, and we're sticking to what works! Our team
members enjoy the technological challenges, collaborating with other talent,
and working in a creative environment. We've found the common thread among
our team is a firm understanding of the online world today, has
entrepreneurial ambition, and has had strong experience either developing
their own innovative solution or working for a company that has.

Hierarchy Free Collaboration
The most important part of what we do is collaboration, and we expect team
members who can give and take constructive criticism when it matters. When
it comes to project development, we all operate on an equal playing field &#8211;
all ideas are heard and the best make up the solution. So speak up, we
expect it!

Startup environment: Cutting Edge &amp; Fast Paced
When working to stay at the forefront of technology, it is necessary to
continually innovate and adapt. We have developed a framework that allows us
to efficiently and effectively design, develop, and deploy code. Forget the
corporate non-sense that slows down the flow. We go from ideas to
implementation in days and weeks, not months and years. One thing you can be
sure working for Fli Digital, there is no such thing as a &quot;stale project&quot;,
the team is consistently faced with new challenges and projects &#8211; keeping
even the most talented developers on their toes!
