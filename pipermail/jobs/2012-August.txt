Morning all!

There's at least one Senior PHP type job at Rackspace:
http://jobs.rackspace.com/job/San-Antonio-Software-Developer-IV-US-Job-TX-78201/2100955/

There are other Software Dev jobs, check out:  http://rackertalent.com/

If you want my opinion of working here, just pick a bunch of random words
and toss in "awesome" a lot. I really love the environment and my task
list. RAX was rated #8 in the top 25 places to work in the US and i believe
it. There are lots of big scale technical challenges to keep you busy.

The rank scale goes from I - IV, with the latter being more Senior
Architect than hands down coder. However, no one will complain if you code
too; the relationships and roles are flexible.

Leam
