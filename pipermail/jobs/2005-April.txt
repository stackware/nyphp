I am accepting a long-term assignment and have another client that I will
no longer be able to service.

They are looking for someone to take over where I am leaving off.

This is not a full-time position. The work can be either project based or
time & materials. That would be up to you to negotiate with them.

The work is interesting and you can choose the technology and methods you
like.
It can also be a good opportunity to experiment with new stuff, be it new
tech or code, etc.
For example, I put together a mobile browser/server kiosk printing system
for them. Definately a unique project and learning experience.

I had, of course, done everything in LAMP.

I have agreed to help them locate someone and transition the current
projects.

If you're interested or have questions, contact me bpang(at)bpang.com.
Include resume or portfolio, or something.

Regards,

Brian

college degree in Computer Science, and have training in both Unix and
Windows environments.  I spend a lot of time on the Linux
