<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Be a part of a new generation of online business promotion. Link Experts
is a cutting edge Internet marketing company ready to explode onto the
rapidly growing online media space. We have a successfully tested
service, and a dynamic winning management team. We are looking for an
experienced software developer to join our team.

This position is fulltime, onsite in our Manhattan (New York, not
Kansas) offices. We are looking for people with full-time, commercial
experience in Linux, PHP, MySQL and Apache.

Please respond by email to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at linkexperts.com</A> with your resume in
plaintext format only, (no MSWord, PDF, URLs, etc.), along with a cover
letter describing how your skills and experience match the following:

Requirements:
- 2 to 5 years of commercial experience coding PHP in a Linux server
environment
- Experience with Prado a major plus!
- Strong understanding and coding experience with the Object-Oriented
features of PHP, especially the new features in PHP5
- Strong experience and understanding of relational databases. This is
not the same as writing SQL. You should understand what makes a good
relational db design. Specific knowledge of MySQL is preferred. Oh, and
you should be able to write SQL as well.
- Excellent communication skills. This is for real, not just thrown in
to make this posting look impressive. If you can't communicate your
ideas and objections clearly and persuasively, how can anyone learn from
all the wonderful things you know?
- Strong knowledge of ego-less programming

Very Desirable:
- Knowledge of Apache's more interesting features and how they apply to
PHP and web development
- Knowledge of XML and Web Services
- Experience using CVS or Subversion in the development of PHP sites.
- Knowledge of basic Linux system administration.
- Not being afraid of telling your boss how their ideas are wrong (if
you know how to do it right).
- Previous contributions to open source projects. We'll encourage and
support you in doing more of that.
- Experience leading a team of programmers in a long-term development 
effort.


Apply to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at linkexperts.com.</A>

Principals only, please. No commissions or referral fees will be paid.
This is full-time, on-site only. No telecommuting.


For those of you who are thinking &quot;Hey I always wanted to move to New
York, and pay 48% of my gross income for an apartment the size of my
car&quot;, we'd like to hear from you. Really.


</PRE>
