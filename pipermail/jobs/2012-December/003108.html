<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>IPRO (ipro.org), located just outside Queens in New Hyde Park, New York, is
seeking a Lead Architect to take over the team. Our current guru is moving
on to new pastures and we need someone to take on his role, his team, and
his commitment to improving the world using technology and data.

IPRO is a non-profit health care improvement company. We work primarily for
state and federal governments with some private work mixed in. Our work is
a mix of internal and external application development, pretty heavy on the
data side. We're a very hands-on, laid-back, but energetic team. The unit
also oversees many Web projects for the company and our direct customers.

Our development activities follow two main paths: first we develop health
care transparency apps such as whynotthebest.org, hospitals.nyhealth.govand
healthcarereportcard.illinois.gov - our team has the largest datastore of
health care indicators in the country. Secondly, we build custom apps for
internal clients and for anyone else who wants them, mostly around health
care but if it fits and we have a desire to do it, we'll take on any
interesting problem.

We have been using CakePHP for about four years now (and PHP since Rasmus
posted it), so any Cake experience is a plus. We're hoping to explore
mobile apps soon, and we're always looking for new ways to inform health
care consumers.

The job has excellent health care benefits and vacation, lots of good
benefits alongside those, and this is a full-time, long-term position. This
role oversees a team of developers, and a handful of consultants as needed.
We also offer telecommuting two days per week. This is a senior position
and we'll be looking for a Masters or equivalent experience producing
complex apps for high profile customers.

If you'd like to know more, or want to come in for an interview or to meet
the team, please contact Donna Rodriguez ( <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">drodriguez at ipro.org</A> ) who can
accept your resume/CV, schedule an interview, or answer your questions.
Please contact me directly if you have any questions _other than_
scheduling.

If this job doesn't sound right for you, but you'd like to work here
anyway, we have developer positions open, please feel free to let us know
of your interest.

Thanks for reading!

Jaz
