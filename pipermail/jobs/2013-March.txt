I am amazed how every time I run a help-wanted ad asking recruiters not 
to contact me, they do anyway.

Marc, no. Seriously, no. And by that I mean, no. As in ... no. But then 
again ... no.

Got it?

NO!

Message-ID: <4375.72.229.162.69.1363711393.squirrel@kacomputerconsulting.com>

Firstly, I would like to say a huge THANK YOU to the several people
(Jerry, Dan, Paul) who have helped me with small issues over the past week
or so.  I know I have been under a huge amount of stress and that never
helps anyone think clearly or debug code.

Secondly, I would like to announce that I am still seeking someone who can
help me see this auction site project through to completion.  Since I have
started a full time job it is difficult to impossible for me to make the
time to do it and the client is just insufferable.  I don't want to paint
a rosy picture of the situation but I can say that there are only a
limited amount of things that do need to still be fixed.

If ANYONE has any time today please let me know, I am a longstanding
member of these lists, know many of you guys and can assure you I will pay
as promptly and as fairly as I can possibly manage for any assistance.

Thanks.

Kristina
