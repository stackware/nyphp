PHP Programmer Needed For Off-site Freelance Gig

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

I am a freelance graphic designer in need of a PHP programmer for an 
e-commerce site for a men's clothing store. It will have a homepage, an 
about us page, a page featuring their suspenders, a page featuring 
their underwear, and a page that features the cuff links that they 
sell. Each of the product line pages will be a "landing page" wih 
thumbnails and when the user clicks on one of them, the page will 
refresh with a page that has the featured item large and the balance of 
items as thumbnails. This site will also need a shopping cart. I think 
that using a hosting company that provides an out-of-the-box e-commerce 
solution that we tweak, would be the best course of action. I need the 
PHP to function in such a way, so that one can log-in through a 
back-end CMS to add, delete or reshuffle merchandise on-the-fly, 
without further programming. I need a programmer who can take my 
layered Photoshop files and turn them into live code and make them 
match my PSDs as much as possible. This project would start sometime 
between now and the end of the year (2004).

In the meantime, you can check out my website @ 
http://www.susankayfritz.com. I had it programmed in PHP, with a 
back-end CMS. I can add/delete/reshuffle projects on-the-fly, and it's 
wonderful!

Please email me directly with questions, quotes and/or your credentials 
at susankayfritz at nyc.rr.com.
