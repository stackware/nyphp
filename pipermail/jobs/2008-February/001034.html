<PRE>Legal Services NYC

Legal Support Unit Online Training Center

 

REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ)

 

Legal Services NYC provides much needed legal help on a full range of civil matters to tens of thousands of New Yorkers currently living in poverty &#8211; and who have nowhere else to turn.  For the past 40 years, our organization has maintained a singular, overriding mission:  to provide expert legal assistance that improves the lives and communities of low-income New Yorkers.  Today Legal Services NYC is the largest provider of free civil legal services to the poor in the nation, with 18 community-based offices and numerous outreach sites throughout all five boroughs.  Legal Services NYC&#8217;s Legal Support Unit (LSU) trains, mentors and supports attorneys and other advocates and also provides a comprehensive Continuing Legal Education program.  

 

The LSU is planning to develop and launch significantly enhanced and expanded version of their current web application in September 2008.  The current application was built following the FuseBox development methodology and using PHP 4, MySQL, and QuickTime technologies.   The development will improve the user and administrative interfaces, the modularity and extensibility of the application, and add new functionality to the center.   Existing data and accounts will be ported to the new application.

 

Vendor Profile/Services Required

 

We are looking for a design and development team that is entirely based in the New York metropolitan area, that has extensive website, e-commerce, multimedia, and database building experience to help the LSU develop the next version of its web application.   We expect to utilize open source database, scripting and development tools.  We anticipate a total of work requiring between 400 and 600 person hours including the discovery and QA phases.  The selected team would need to begin work by May 1st to meet the project deadlines.  

 

All parties who are:

a)      based in New York metropolitan area

b)      interested in receiving a Request for Proposals (RFP) detailing the full scope of work, including initial specifications and a tour of the existing system
