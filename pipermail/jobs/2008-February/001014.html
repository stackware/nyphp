<PRE>Location: NY Metro--AWESOME creative, well-funded start up...

 

To move things forward then, a link to your portfolio/sites you've done,
- some OOP PHP code samples: doesn't have to be 'runnable' code, the
purpose of the request is for you to let your code speak for you. Show
us some of your best work, stuff you're most proud of - think bigger
than DB abstraction classes, forms manipulation classes, email
composition and delivery classes, pagination classes... something you
think of as impressive is what we want to see.

Description

We're a very well funded web startup with eyes on a fast and spectacular
success - in which 'very prompt return' equity is available. So if you
are a PHP developer  of high skill and experience, and you'd like the
opportunity to make bank fast, read on...

 

We're after something that is hard to find in the PHP world - a skilled
professional with banging OOP talent. We use PHP to its fullest extent
and highly abstracted - we need someone who loves to play at this level.
We're embarking on a big feature sprint, we need more talent to push
this to the next level of velocity. We have multiple development streams
producing features using a custom php framework that cuts down the
tedium, allowing you to do the interesting/challenging/beautiful stuff -
all in sustainable, maintainable and efficient coding styles of course.

 

Specifics, we're talking about you having :

- experience working with a variety of php frameworks (CakePHP, Savant,
Symfony, etc. - you won't know ours, but knowledge of others will help a
lot)

- experience building websites using highly reuseable, abstract, OOP
code

- knowledge of and experience in using the various ajax-y/dhtml
libraries out there.

- javascript creation and optimization skills  

 

You'll be a more winning candidate to us if you have:

- experience working in the Scrum Agile development methodology.

- some layout skill (you know how to float things, nest things, div
things - you don't use tables for layout.)

- experience optimizing websites for scalability (we're going to see
some major traffic here, the code must scale)

- working in a development team with people with a variety of front- and
back-end skill sets.

 

&gt;<i>From our side, advantages of joining us are:
</I>
- we're a startup, there's equity consideration

- we're a starup, we move very quickly and your opinions are demanded

- our office is pet friendly

- we develop on Macbook pros (well, I think it's a plus.)

- we're very capable, so you'll be in good company
