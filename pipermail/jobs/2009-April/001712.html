Hot New Advertising Platform &amp; Network Looking for Amazing Developer

Apparition Ads is a next generation Rich Media advertising platform.  
Based in NYC, Apparition Ads has been quietly developing its  
technology over the past year and in beta tests generated an average  
eCPM of $58 including on social media websites. Apparition Ads  
developed a proprietary rich media advertising unit and ad serving  
system that blows away competitive platforms. The company is about to  
launch its platform to the public over the upcoming weeks with the  
goal of rolling it out as an ad network as well as licensing the  
technology to other ad networks. Apparition Ads was founded by  
veterans of the industry and has many key relationships in place to  
sell its ad inventory and develop its brand in the marketplace.

Apparition Ads is looking for a Senior Developer to join its team and  
help build out the product. The system is built in pHp based on the  
Amazon cloud. Experience with ad serving, optimization engines and  
API's a plus. We are looking the best developer out there who is  
looking to be part of a hot startup run by top entrepreneurs in NYC.  
This isn't a job opportunity, it's an opportunity to build a big  
company and own significant equity. We need one more core developer  
who will be tasked with building out our API and working on our  
targeting and optimization engine.

Apparition Ads has been self-funded to date and has prided itself on  
its ability to Bootstrap further (one of the founders founded  
Bootstrapper.com) and we are looking for an incredible developer who  
believes in the philosophy of building lead, building hard, building  
to scale.

Is this you?

If you think so, some questions to answer:

What is the most advanced technology you've personally developed?

Have you worked in advertising technology ?

Why do you think you are qualified to be our senior developer?



Sincerely yours,

Richie Hecker
Chief Bootstrapper
