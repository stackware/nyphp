Objective: Expert Level PHP Web
Developer

&#160;

&#160;

I believe when
employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate.
This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone
including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me
extraordinary is that I do something that others don&#8217;t, I go the extra mile. I
am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new
career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make
the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff.

&#160;

Throughout the years
I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some
failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards
my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and
learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years,
designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as
a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there
are two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work
for their career. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many
talents and creativity to your position. Consider me for your position because
unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in first
place.
