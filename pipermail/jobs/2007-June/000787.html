<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>BabbleMail is a new startup located in NE Oklahoma who's goal is to change the face of international email, IM, text messaging, and documents. We were founded in April, 2007, are currently working on the final tweaks of our application platform, and are set to launch on July 4, 2007. But, before we can do that, we need your help to bring our service to market.

WHAT WE NEED:

We need a solid LAMP developer who is willing to jump into a startup environment with both feet. While your job will primarily be programming, the idea candidate should be able to do other basic things like Linux server admin, mail server admin, MySQL admin, etc. The skills we desire in the right person are:

- Strong LAMP skills (emphasis on PHP/MySQL)
- Understanding of XML
- Linux server administration experience
- Postfix server administration experience (or willing to learn)
- The ability to learn quickly and turn that knowledge into code

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU:

We'll admit it, it'll be rough. We are a pre-funded company that has very little money. We are currently working deals with MSN, Yahoo, Google, Adobe, and several other companies so the money should be here soon. Right now, we are looking for someone willing to work for either equity, deferred compensation, or a combination of both.

By working with us now, you'll get:

- Ground floor opportunity to get in while it's small and grow with us 
- Expand your skillset (learn, grow, apply new skills right away)
- Corporate equity (you'll get a percentage ownership of the company)
- Stock options (yeah, LOT'S of them)

HOW TO CONTACT US IF INTERESTED:

If you are interested in working with us or would like to know more please contact me at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">anthony at adcl.biz</A> or by phone at  (918) 926-0139 anytime.
