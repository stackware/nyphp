Greetings, 


I have a client in New York City, who is a very strong late stage startup with exceptional growth and opportunity.  This firm is backed by some very well know media companies and individuals.  



My firm has placed the VP of Engineering, Director of Infrastructure, Senior Architect and a number of engineers.  The role is a PHP software engineering role working on the back end of a data driven high performance system.  



In addition to an eagerness for 
web 2.0 development, you should be experienced building blogging or social networking systems (even outside of work).  You need to have a deep understanding of PHP as it pertains to building systems not just integrating with a CMS backend.  This isn't web development.  You will be building an API or working on Web services depends on your skill set and preference.  


Offers include stock options so you will literally own a piece of what you're building.


To be considered for this or other exceptional roles please send your resume with the expectation of complete confidentiality to khansbury at winterwyman.com

Hello,

My name is Anthony Papillion and I'm an experienced web developer living and
working in NE Oklahoma. I've worked in traditional software and web
development for over 10 years and have the skills, dedication, and knowledge
to provide my clients with an exceptional experience at affordable prices.
Think about the cost of living and working in the Tri-State area as opposed
to NE Oklahoma and you'll quickly see why working with me will save you
money. Yes, I'm out of the area but I also don't charge tri-state rates.

My skills include:

- Comfortable in a LAMP environment
- LAMP focused but also skilled on PHP on Windows
- Solid knowledge of both PHP 4 and 5 with OOP
- Strong graphics design skills
- Experienced with both small and extremely large projects
- Well versed in other technologies such as .NET, Java, and Python
- The ability to learn quickly an integrate what I learn immediately into
real world projects
- ColdFusion experience
- Strong JavaScript Skills
- AJAX

If you have a project needing special attention or you're tired of finding
web developers who don't deliver for one reason or another then contact me
and let's discuss your needs. You can contact me 24 hours a day @
918.926.0139 or via Skype @ CajunTechie.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Anthony Papillion

Anthony, what rate(s) do you charge?  I ask only because your post 
seems to imply that developers here in the "tri-state area" make 
significantly more money.  

In fact, we have been struggling with rate issues for years since the 
2001 recession, and have troubles also due to the high influx of H1s 
coming into the country through this area, leading to a glut of 
practitioners and confusion among clients as to who is truly qualified 
and what fair rates should be.  

I think, and I have seen in practice, that out in remote areas like 
Oklahoma or Kansas or rural Florida for instance, rates are $10-15/hr 
HIGHER than rates we get here in NYC.  

Because let's face it, it's very difficult to find a good programmer in 
rural Florida.  In NYC, maybe not as difficult.

Do you know how to send text messages without carrier information?

Fli Digital is looking for great developers to join our Fresh team in
Hauppauge, NY. But, we won't settle for just anyone. We want the best, and
only the best. Plain and simple: we're looking for talent; if most of the
following describes you, you probably have it and we're interested:

IF YOU...

   - are a self proclaimed "pro" in PHP5 with MySQL and love OOP.
   - are often called "arrogant" or "cocky" by your friends or family,
   but can usually back it up (at least as a developer).
   - actually know what Web 2.0 is, and it bothers you when people use it
   just because they can.
   - developed your own version of [INSERT CLICHE WEB 2.0 WEB SITE] just
   to see if you could.
   - hate your commute or corporate job, aren't making ends meet with
   freelance projects or your ad-sense revenue on your blog just isn't cutting
   it.
   - have a passion for what you do, and want to make good money doing
   it, but still have fun.


Here's a little bit about us?

WE...

   - develop awesome web applications. (like the Fresh Platform!)
   - love what we do.
   - use Mac's, and love them (we won't make you love them too, but will
   try!).
   - work in a modern and stylish office with a great vibe.
   - are young, ambitious and embrace entrepreneurial spirit.
   - have a fun, satisfying and collaborative workplace.
   - have a 'start-up' environment even though we've been around and
   growing since 2002.
   - value talent, experience and pure intelligence a lot more than
   degrees and certificates.
   - value our employees and take care of them, so we offer great
   salaries, plenty of benefits (full health, IRA with match) and random perks
   and bonuses.


Sounds like you might want to work here? Take a few minutes and fill-out our
job application, we'd love to hear from you!

	details. 
Message-ID: <OFCA1B4F5E.02F814D2-ON8525742F.0059FA3D-8525742F.005BC6A2@win.starpoint.com>

A company based out Clark, New Jersey is seeking a fulltime Sr. PHP 
developer. 

The company is a very flat organization. You would be reporting to the 
Director of IT and would be the PHP SME within the organization.  They are 
currently hiring at the rate of one employee a month...so the organizaiton 
is expanding and obviously your role would increase as well. 

They are more of a product company then a software solution firm.  This is 
not so much developing websites as working on on content.  They are 
migrating their front end from AJAX to PHP.  Hence the need. 

We know the president/founder of the company.  He used to be the Sr. 
executive at our firm.  Our CEO and him still are very good friends. Thus, 
the resume is going to be looked at if we send it over. 

What they do develop a Mobile Messaging Product  on an Enterprise Level. 
Currently working with some big accounts. 

Understanding Content Managment System seems to be curical.   Joomla is a 
slam dunk ...perhaps Drupal.  Something similar. 

The Linux is not that big of a deal. being comfortable in Linux is ideal. 

The salary is $60,000 to I would say as high as $80,000.  The higher you 
go the more transparent it has to be about added benefit of highering 
you...ie. if you had developed products,  or 4 continous years of PHP  or 
Joomla -content management Expert. 

Requirements include:

? A strong knowledge of PHP with 2-4 years of experience

? An understanding of Open Source Applications; specifically Joomla.

? Know how to set up and configure a variety of Linux distributions

? Be able to setup and configure Apache and Tomcat server configurations

? Have a basic understanding of JavaScript

? Be very detail oriented and be able to handle many assignments at the 
same time

? Have a strong knowledge of HTML

? Be able to research functional capabilities

? Have an understanding of web graphics and design

? Fast learner

? Ability to work in a dynamic, fast-paced, energetic, team-oriented 
environment
Please be prepared to show examples of PHP work that you have done.
Benefits:

? Medical & dental benefits
? Company matched retirement plan
? Opportunity for growth


Call me with any questions 732-744-3119 and send me the e-mail.

	developer
Message-ID: <008901c8a1a9$75cad070$c7c7a8c0@netcominfo.ada>

Okay, we are NOT a web development company, a consulting company, an
e-commerce company, an online web 2.0 firm, a start up company etc.

 

But, we're not BORING either. What we are is a world-class IT training
company.

We developed a custom in house ERP system that is just about as advanced as
anything out there for training companies.

 

That system took us from our modest beginnings to one of the fastest growing
companies in America. Last year we won a very coveted learning partner award
out of 1400 companies, worldwide because of it. We grew from 3 people to 65
today because of it. (and still growing rapidly by the month) We're looking
for someone to help us take this system and move it to the next level and
take over the world. (okay, at least in the United States, first)

 

We have a very small team of 3, close knit developers working on this
system. We're looking to add one more to our family. We don't believe in
numbers, having dozens of developers. We believe in talent and teamwork.
We're looking for a talented, unpretentious, world-class developer to join
our team.

 

Needless to say, the candidate must possess stellar PHP skills, SQL skills
and DHTML/CSS/JavaScript/Ajax skills. Some Linux skills would be a plus. 

If you are a beginner, that's fine as well, as long as you are talented,
hungry to learn and hardworking.

 

Salary will be depending on experience. Our offices are located in the
Empire State Building so travel to the city is a must. 

We will not entertain remote developers, outsourcing companies.  Principal
candidates only and must be legally authorized to work in the US.

 

If you feel we are right for you, then send your resume to:
adam at netcominfo.com

It appears your strength is more heavily in systems, how would you

Message-ID: <2e49dd430804221513x66fa43fboa4e8039c411b9189@mail.gmail.com>

We are looking for an additional MVC/PHP programmer to work in conjunction
with another freelance (not side by side, but on different projects
simultaneously). Our website is www.tungstenproperty.com ? we need someone
to help us:

 1. Add/change various features to the Public Site - Specifically speeding
up the General Uploading and Rendering of the site, its annoying slow at
timeso compared to our competiors and we seem to have trouble finding
someone that can help diagnose the problem.  Additionally, we would like to
structure a new sub template that allows sub domain pages to be easily
integrated into the main site with basic HTML coding.  Intergration of
Google Maps into the site.  Long term we need to work on a more robust
search/sort system.  We are looking for something very simple and fast to
navigate, any proposals would be welcome.
 2. Maintain and improve our current multi-user (user friendly) database,
which is based on a series of the language based below (I am
 not sure which one myself) - Including expanding number of out source
locations via RSS and other custom scripts, implementing an email blast
system to a list we have  improving general speed and usability of YUI
interface, configuring searchable, interfirm, user friendly DB for listings
to be sorted/saved

Requirements:
* You should have considerable experience with PHP and with MYSQL, LAMP
stack
* You should be able to work with and adjust to other peoples code. We have
heard that our code is fairly "clean", however I am not a programmer and
imagine this more a matter of opinion than fact.  Nevertheless, you will
have to work on top of someone elses work in many cases.
* You must be VERY reachable; we have had the unfortunate experience of not
being able to contact our programmers for days on end ? it's ok if you are
busy/away/unavailable, it is just important for you to let us know.
* You must be able to keep deadlines, this means, you set realistic
deadlines for yourself, which we will expect you to uphold, and that you
have the discipline to keep them. If you like, you can provide us with
references that highlight your ability to do this.  We are interested in a
pay structure that rewards speed and execution.  For instance - if you quote
a project for three days and $100, we will pay you $120 if complete in two
days, $90 if you complete in 4 days, $80 if you complete in 3 days, etc.  We
are open to any creative structure you may suggest as well.
* A professional/diligent attitude to work without losing your creative
ability.
* Languages (if you don't know every single one it can probably still be
figured out):
 ? PHP5
 ? PEAR
 ? MVC
 ? YUI (Yahoo UI)
 ? OOProgramming (Basics)
 ? CakePHP Framework
 ? Apache 1.3/2.0
 ? MySQL 4/5
 ? Subversion
 ? Linux Administration
 ? SSH
 ? ImageMagik
 ? HTML / CSS / Javascript

If you are interested in this position please reply with resume/portfolio
and general hourly rate to dooleytj+np at gmail.com <dooleytj%2Bnp at gmail.com>

Ridiculous opportunity for LAMP developer with early stage start-up.

Help partners who have already built world-class companies (and sold them),
to do it again. If you want a job that you can do mindlessly in between
Guitar Hero gigs, don't read any further. If you want to stretch your brain
and get excited about your work every day, keep going.

You will be lead developer, VP of Engineering and CTO all in one. But
hopefully, titles won't excite you as much as building and launching stuff
does.

You can do the work from anywhere but you must be available to meet in NYC
at least twice a month.

No HTML, CSS or any graphic work is required. You are hard-core back-end.
Javascript, AJAX, optional.

Job duties:
Help complete writing (you think, we'll write) technology specification.
Architect and help build complex, social advertising marketplace.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- Expert knowledge of PHP5
- Expert knowledge of relational database design and deployment for dynamic
sites using MySQL 5
- Minimum of 3 years of Object Oriented design and
programming experience
- Knowledge of basic Linux systems administration skills
- Entrepreneurial fervor and desire to knock heads together (to get things
done)

SOMEWHAT IMPORTANT:
- Experience with (AJAX) / Javascript /
- Familiarity working with the Symfony PHP framework
- Experience with one or more or caching
engines, eg. APC, Zend, etc.

WE DONT CARE:
- You live with your momma
- You sing while playing the drums in RockBand
- You like cats
- You only read non-fiction
- You wear chinos and hush-puppies

COMPENSATION:
Lots of stock options and an uncompetitive salary.

Ning, Inc. in Palo Alto, CA is looking for Application Developers to
join our team.  Ning is an online platform for creating your own social
networks for anything. The company was founded by Marc Andreessen and
Gina Bianchini and currently hosts over 235,000 social networks, growing
at over 1,000 per day. In fact, Ning powers the largest number of social
networks on the Internet. We also just raised another $60 million
dollars at a $500M pre-money valuation and are featured in this month's
Fast Company (see article
<http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/125/nings-infinite-ambition.html?pa
ge=0%2C4> ).  Ideally, we would relocate you to beautiful Northern
California, but the right people can work remotely (and plan on visiting
us on a regular basis).

 

The Group:

Our Application Developer group is a small, flat organization populated
with people who are passionate about creating beautiful software used by
millions of people in their daily lives.  We use PHP and Javascript on
top of the Ning Platform REST APIs to deliver an extremely friendly and
infinitely customizable experience to Network Creators on Ning.  

 

Responsibilities

*           Play a key role in designing new features (that will be used
by millions of people), and generating ideas for updates and
development, often in 2-4 week cycle times. 

*           Ability to work with other teams - such as design and
product management - but also work independently; having ownership of
projects concerning features for networks on Ning.

*           Work on both front-end features - like photo sharing, video
sharing, events, discussions, and blogs - as well as continuously
optimizing the back-end infrastructure to increase performance at
rapidly increasing levels of scale.

 

Requirements

*           BS/MS in CS or equivalent experience. 

*           Experience with PHP, AJAX, and HTML/CSS. 

*           Java or C++ or object oriented design experience.

*           Experience programming scalable web applications.

*           Knowledge of web services, and agile development
methodologies desired. 

*           Know your way around Flash. 

*           Curiosity. You've created a social network on Ning. You dive
into a bit more detail and are struck by the Ning Content Store and why
we chose that architecture. You have lots of technical questions for us.

 

Send me an email if interested.  Check out www.ning.com
<http://www.ning.com/>  for more information on the company and

about our platform.  Enjoy your day!

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] X-Cart programming needed
Message-ID: <dcd65d780804291721y6f562b8fsd7035b3306e1b910@mail.gmail.com>

Need someone with the time to complete some programming work on an already
installed cart. Minor styling tweaks, x-affiliate experience necessary. Must
be local. Turnaround is 2 weeks. Will provide detailed spec and comps on
email. Thanks!
