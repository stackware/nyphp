the core is always the same. Every participant on Yield Manager, our ad
management platform, buys or sells each individual impression dynamically in
the first open exchange for online media (one of our businesses, the RM Ad

exchange. All buyers and sellers in the exchange are interconnected on a

billion impressions in the exchange daily. We need more forward-thinking

The steve project (http://steve.museum) <http://steve.museum%29> is a 
consortium of art museum professionals, developing open source art image 
social tagging software. We desperately need a new public face for our 
website, and we?re seeking an experienced Joomla! person to help us with 
setup and templates.

We have a new site design, but it?s not up yet and we?ve run into a snag 
with getting the Joomla! templates built. And we?re releasing the steve 
core software, admin tool, and tagging tool next week so we need the 
Joomla! work done ASAP. We really need the site to be looking its best 
when we make the release.

That means we?re looking for someone to work with us starting this 
Tuesday, Oct. 10th, and to do maybe 2-3 days of solid work to get the 
site done by next Thursday (or sooner, if possible!). Primarily we need 
a handful of templates done nicely, but we will also welcome help with 
setting Joomla! up in the most efficient way, so some architecture 
skills might be very helpful as well.

Although we are a largely volunteer project, we have funding and we can 
pay realistic rates, especially for top-notch, reliable consultants who 
can commit to making our strict deadline on such short notice. If you 
are interested, please contact steve at steve.museum with your typical 
rates and contact info. We need to find someone this weekend, so don?t 
delay!

Thank you very much,
