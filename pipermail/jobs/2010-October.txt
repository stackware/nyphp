Agreed.  My company is also in the market for someone with similar skills,
however education is not a requirement - just knowing how to make things
well is.

Also my company is in a space that is actually fun to work in.  Many great
parties, smart intelligent good looking people.

So if anyone with good php and or js skills, reply privately to me.... Nice
office in the ass of the garment district (lower west 30's).

Thanks!

There are many industries to apply php skills.  Some are more pleasant to
work within than others for the most part.  That is all!

  Ben,

Is this a real job.

  Patrick,

I think this job is bogus.  I know several who have applied.  Nothing.

I think some of the job listings are hooks for head-hunters to get 
resumes and identities to poll potential employers.

Agreed.  My company is also in the market for someone with similar skills, however education is not a requirement - just knowing how to make things well is.

Also my company is in a space that is actually fun to work in.  Many great parties, smart intelligent good looking people.

So if anyone with good php and or js skills, reply privately to me.... Nice office in the ass of the garment district (lower west 30's).

Thanks!

Message-ID: <00ac01cb7519$aabd8390$00388ab0$@com>

Technically strong Interactive agency in Rochelle Park, NJ seeks Front End
web developer with a can-do attitude for immediate full time employment.

About you: You are fully engaged in the social web not because it's cool,
but because you 'get it'. Your enthusiasm for emerging web technologies is
infectious. You're practically an evangelist, except you can actually walk
the talk and execute beautifully, amazing our clients and your peers.

You won't work alone-we get that too. We will challenge you and look forward
to being challenged by you. We will clap, when appropriate.

Typical projects include developing in HTML5, performing jQuery/javascript
magic, and even optimizing PDFs for search engine performance. Conversion
matters, so we want you to help us win when we execute on the web. Front End
means rich interfaces (perhaps inside the CMS of the month), attractive and
functional CSS/HTML wherever needed, and just about everything related to
content.

We do web and interactive (tablets, kiosks, mobile devices) so we assume you
recognize the importance of mobile going forward.

We sponsor Open-Source related conferences (NYCBSDCON, NYPHP Holiday Party,
JoomlaDay NYC, and more) participate in them, and speak from the podium to
share our expertise. We expect you might like to participate too, given an
opportunity.

We are a boutique interactive agency that integrates strategy, SEM, SEO,
Social Media, and custom applications, to solve interesting and complex
problems for our clients. We are focused on generating compelling data
driven SEM insights, opportunities and communication so that clients
experience more effective interactive programs that enhance brand/product
equity and maximize bottom-line performance

Details: On Site Full-time, Health Insurance, Benefits & Continuing
Education Opportunities.

To be considered you must submit your resume and be sure to include the URLs
of 5 web sites you crafted recently.

Message-ID: <1966637399.1288110111811.JavaMail.cfservice@sl3app3>




Full time (no contractors please) Mid - Senior level PHP development opportunity available for a true coder who can hack their way through the development of highly scalable transactional web sites.   This is not a cowboy coding environment by any standard, there is no need for developers hung up on a CS degree they've earned  (of course it's ok if you have one).   Your work should stand on it's own as an indication of your abilities.  

In this role you'll work across the entire LAMP stack with a team of laid back developers focused on producing top notch work on well communicated deadlines.  Well well rested developers make the most productive contributors, of course. 


I have placed 2 coders with this team and they love it.  You will get your hands on new technologies and introduce your favorites to the rest of the team.  This environment is not limited to PHP, my client takes on projects written with any open source language which is why they prefer the type of hackers who exhibit a passion for learning new skills.


To be considered for this role or others like it, please send your resume with the expectation of confidentiality to Kainne Hansbury khansbury at winterwyman.com




 

Cheers,
