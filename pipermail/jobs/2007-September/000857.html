<PRE>Position: Senior Web Developer

Stylesight is searching for experienced PHP/MySQL developers for full- 
time positions in its Greenwich Village office.

Any candidate responding to this ad should have at least a BA/BS, and  
ideally a MA/MS, in Computer Science or a related field.  Exceptions  
may be made for those with a high level (6+ years) of corresponding  
experience in the field.

Successful candidates must have at least 3 years experience with PHP,  
including at least 1 year of experience with object-oriented PHP 5.   
Candidates should also have at least 3 years experience with MySQL,  
with at least 1 year of experience with MySQL 5.0.  Candidates should  
be comfortable with stored procedures, stored functions, and  
triggers.  Fluency in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flash, Actionscript, and  
XML is also required, and candidates should be familiar with AJAX  
techniques.

Other capabilities which are desired but not required include:

-  Ruby on Rails
-  XSLT/XPath/XQuery
-  Experience with Actionscript 3
-  UI Layout and Design
-  Java
-  C/C++
-  Browser Plugins
-  Dashboard Widgets / Vista Gadgets
-  Apache and MySQL load balancing/clustering
-  Perl
-  Scripted Image Manipulation/Transformation

This is a full time position with health and dental benefits.   
Candidates can expect to earn $60K/year or more, commensurate with  
experience.  We are a growing company and this is a great opportunity  
to show your chops in a wide variety of areas, and to move into a  
leadership role.

Work must be done primarily on-site - no outside staffing agencies,  
no outsourcing companies, and no candidates outside the NYC metro  
area should apply!

To apply, please e-mail your resume, cover letter, a list of at least  
2 websites along with information about your role in that site's  
development, and your salary expectation.  Please do not call us,  
apply by e-mail only.  Thank you!
