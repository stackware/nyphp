<PRE>Reflexions Data is a growing team of creative technology innovators that 
develops web applications using open source technologies for clients in 
a variety of industries including publishing, marketing, retail 
e-commerce, internet startups and non-profit organizations. We are an 
equal opportunity employer (M/F/D/V).

Learn more about us here: www.reflexionsdata.com

Our office is a casual, fast-paced environment and we offer competitive 
compensation and benefits. We are currently seeking candidates for the 
positions of &quot;PHP Developer&quot; and &quot;Senior Developer&quot; at our White Plains, 
NY office.  Candidates who are only available to work remotely, or to 
work on-site only part time, are still encouraged to apply but the 
ability to work full time at our office will be valued highly.

Candidates must be willing to work in a closely-knit team environment 
and must demonstrate a passion for solving business problems with 
technology. BA/BS in computer science or similar field is preferred. 
Salary is commensurate with experience.

Candidates should have experience with web and software development best 
practices and familiarity with the technologies and skills listed below:

* Linux / UNIX
* Apache v1.3/2.x and name-based virtual hosts
* SQL and query optimization
* Shell scripting
* Regular expressions
* MySQL
* PostGREsql
* PHP v5.x
* Python
* Perl
* Ruby on Rails
* SVN
* XHTML, CSS
* Javascript and AJAX
* XML

Knowledge of systems architecture, formal specification documents, and 
systems administration is also extremely valuable.  Additional knowledge 
of more traditional programming tools such as C++ or Java is helpful but 
not required.

Applicants for the &quot;PHP Developer&quot; position should have a minimum of two 
years professional experience and working knowledge of at least several 
of the technologies listed above.  Applicants for the &quot;Senior Developer&quot; 
position should have a minimum of five years professional experience and 
intimate knowledge of most or all of the technologies listed above.  
Nevertheless, an ability and eagerness to learn new things is as 
valuable to us as knowledge of specific technologies.

Do you have strong opinions about things like agile development 
methodologies and unit testing?  Do you think about what kind of shell 
scripts you could write to save yourself a few minutes a day?  Do you 
have a terminal window open right now?  If so, this might be the 
position for you.

Apply with a cover letter stating your salary requirements, your 
earliest date of availability, and a copy of your resume/CV by 
submitting an application via our website here:
<A HREF="http://www.reflexionsdata.com/company/employment">http://www.reflexionsdata.com/company/employment</A>

Note that applications without a cover letter, or applications that are 
not submitted via our web-based employment application form, will not be 
considered.
