<PRE>We are currently looking for several candidates for the following positions!

PHP Developers (junior-senior level)
These are excellent opportunities in a rapidly growing online technology 
company that uses cutting edge open source tools to develop a variety of 
online marketing solutions. Excellent benefits are available, and they 
provide a great work environment for their developers. Each developer 
receives 2 large flat screen monitors and can run the operating system 
of their choice on their computers. (Gentoo seems to be winning at the 
moment!)

Sr. Application Developers
These positions are with a company that is developing a social 
networking website for adults/businesses that promises to be the site to 
rise above and become the leader in business social networking sites. 
They are pushing technology to the limit and developing a cutting edge 
technology infrastructure that will rival some of the largest technology 
leaders. They have a casual dress work environment, flexible hours and a 
&quot;work hard play hard&quot; atmosphere. The founder has a track record of 
building extremely successful companies including multi-billion dollar IPOs.
