Hi Mark,

If you want to consider an Open Source solutions company with twenty five 
developers for this, let me know. EVOKNOW, my company, does extensive 
PHP/MySQL solutions and we even wrote the books on LAMP. See our 
publications at http://www.evoknow.com. <http://www.evoknow.com>

Since you have already set a time-line for this, I wanted to give you a cost 
estimate based on "your time line of three weeks". We charge $40/hour and 
for a person to spend three week, the cost would be: $4800.00. If it require 
multiple person (which is usually the case) the cost can be higher.

If you are interested, give me a call at the office #916.920.4730. Thanks
