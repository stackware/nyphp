Message-ID: <CABActuAaonHhhNwGZ9Vu0Zo91fYK24=9FBeYDPg5gURmFjq5Ng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am writing to the list because I have decided that I will be leaving the
city of Boston and relocating to a country
setting in Western Mass where the kids can run and play.  The city just
stinks for kids growing up :)

I am looking for one of two things and if you have information about either
I would appreciate some information.

I am looking to relocate to North Adams, MA and would be willing to commute
up to an hour and a half.

If anyone knows about a position in Western Mass or that knows of a
Telecommute position please let me know.

I have about 14 years of experience working with PHP in a LAMP environment.

Attached is my resume.

	WordPress T-Shirts
Message-ID: <CAFVqUJQyhNQYydvjk-_auyfUP_b-XbZnhebhTSSrt8kajiMEeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Below is a position we are looking to fill ASAP...feel free to email
jobs at sanbornmediafactory.com to apply.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
PHP Developer // Crime Fighter // Wearer of Ironic WordPress T-Shirts

WE ARE:
Sanborn Media Factory (www.sanbornmediafactory.com), a 30-person
interactive creative agency based in midtown Manhattan. We create digital
campaigns and products in the form of sites, mobile apps, videos, social
campaigns, and experiential installations.

YOU ARE:
A decent human being in search of a good job with a shop that is big enough
to bite off important, stable and meaningful work and small enough to still
have fun doing it.

YOU HAVE THESE SKILLS:
- We mostly do PHP and JavaScript. But were open: we keep it lean and get
the job done.
- Strong experience with a couple of frameworks and CMS's. Like...youve
used Wordpress, Drupal, CodeIgnitor, Laravel, SilverStripe, Symfony (or
Silex), Magento, etc, etc, you-get-the-point.
- You know what CSRF means and can think of 2 good ways to stop it.
Security is a part of how you build (basic form protection to hashing
sensitive info, to HMAC-SHA1 to oAuth).
- You know that the Cerberus of application performance tuning, horizontal
scaling, and overall robustness is a double-edged sword of glory and pain,
but you like the challenge, and caching is your friend.
- Attention to detail and what makes a good experience a great one.
- Understanding of QA/Testing - we distribute our QA workload here, so it's
a team effort. You'll be helping all of us build the best product possible.

YOU CAN ACCEPT AND EMBRACE THESE THINGS ABOUT US:
Our house rules are simple but not for everyone:

- No shitheads allowed.
We have a shithead eco-flush system that targets douchebaggery and
assholery at its faintest signals and expunges it from our premises with an
all-natural, organic floodwater filtration pump. Upside: There are no
shitheads here. Downside: Downside? Dont be a shitheadthere is no downside.

- Honesty is paramount.
We get along and we constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each
other or our clients, we don't hide or say what we think others want to
hear. We do it with respect and we value truth, transparency and honesty
above all else.

- We do it live.
We're not reckless or fecklessbut we believe strongly in getting something
in our hands quickly and iterating (as opposed to
powerpointing/conceptualizing our way through life). This sometimes means
rapid prototyping a proof of concept in the morning, presenting it in the
afternoon and nailing it down for a launch by the end of the week.

- We do it together.
Our work is done in a giant fish bowl and we help each other solve problems
all day long. If you are more of a consolidated strike weapon and prefer to
move through the jungle alonewere probably not the place you want to hang
your hat.

The "human side" of this is very important to us (and if you are the right
person it will be vital to you as well). But needless to say if you are a)
a good person and b) someone who enjoys working within a team and c)
someone who gets their shit done and likes accountability as much as
visibility for kicking ass - we'd like to see you soon.

THE DETAILS:
If you're interested in the position, please write to us knowing the
following:

- The owner of the company (and the guy writing this post) will read ALL of
the applications first and pass on the ones that appear to be a match onto
the Technical Director. I will read every application - I always do, you
have my word.

- If you are interested in applying, please send a resume (if you have
one), some links to your work and whatever notes you want to pass on about
each and write me a note that does its best to convey who you are
underneath the layers of standard issue cover letter babble and HR bubble
wrap. Talk to me like a human being who values directness and using your
own words. If you need to use a four-letter word to effectively express a
previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe
your ideal work environment, I'll take that over what you would think I
typically "need to hear" in a job application. So have at it....but know
that I am really just looking for good, smart people who are in search of
the kind of special sauce we make here.

- Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience (and
height). Full-time position with benefits but open to starting with a
freelance gig if wading into the water is preferred on both sides.

- Please respond to jobs at sanbornmediafactory.com with "APOLLO CREED" in the
subject line of your response so I know that you read this whole thing and
that you are not a nefarious machine, a recruiter or a well-intentioned
company that is unwilling to understand I need a human being sitting in my
office to do this work I need done (not an off-shore firm).

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Junior/Mid Web Developer for *Full Time* onsite hire
 (Chelsea) $60k+ CWE
Message-ID: <4B124DDCDDC2B74DA45ACAEEB446D8D90990CCE9@PDC.nylon.local>

Junior/Mid Web Developer for *Full Time* onsite hire (Chelsea)

** No headhunters, freelance or offshore please!**

We value creative, independent people who love programming and enjoy a stable, energetic work environment.

Unlike many shops, we are not looking for not just a code monkey, but a professional programmer interested in expanding not only their programming skills, but also the skills necessary for a successful career in client facing programming (as opposed to just sitting in a dungeon doing back end work). That is very important to stress: this is a client facing position, so enjoying that aspect of the job is a necessity.

Our clients projects range from the occasional WordPress site to high profile, large scale CMS and E-Comms; we work with creative agencies to deliver technical and business consulting, as well as deliver the technology required for that particular project; we host a number of our client projects as well and assist in the configuration and maintenance of client hosting environments.

A sample of how our varied project types run:
- Blank Sheet Project (discovery/documentation/design/db & application build/qa/launch) 
- Maintenance Project - pre-existing sites (either our projects or inherited projects) 
- Add/Modify large sets of features to existing project

All of these require interacting with the project producer and the client in order to scope the project, estimate time, decide on the technology to be used, etc. Staffed entirely by experienced web producers and developers, every project is a collaboration! 

You will work with seasoned developers, but should have 1-2 years of the following skills:

- Excellent written and verbal communication skills 
- Business problem analysis and solving skills, as well as basic documentation 
- Project estimating and planning 
- MySQL/ MSSQL Database architecture (planning, creating and maintaining) 
- PHP & Programming methodologies/frameworks/Installations (Zend, etc.) - Certifications a plus!
- Front End HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery/Sencha 
- Code documentation 
- PSD/Graphics Slicing 

Team skills required:
- You can work very independantly and enjoy problem solving
- You know when to stop solving it yourself and ask your team for help
- Work in a very horizontal, stand-on-your-own-two-feet environment 
- Carve pumpkins and bowl! 
- Everyone takes out the garbage (but no one does windows) 

Bonus skills include:
- Drupal
- ColdFusion 
- Basic design skills 
- Python/Ruby/Perl/Etc. 
- HTML5 or CSS3 
- LAMP/WAMP Server config & management 
- iOS/Android Development 
- C/.NET/Other programming 
- Other programming interests (robotics, etc.)

We offer: 
- 401K 
- Medical 
- Generous Sick/Vacation/Personal
- TransitCheck

Where: 
A block away from Penn station, big windows, no cubicles.

Please read these requirements simple carefully:

1. Email a cover letter as an email that includes your availability (for interviews and starting work, in general). The subject line must read "Web Developer - [Your First and Last Name]"
2. Your Resume/CV, attached, with references and URLs.


**We are EOE** **You must be able to work legally in the USA***

Mike,

Good for him!

I wish him the best of luck! Don't get discouraged either.

(I also would like to mention that if he is willing to collect 
signatures for a candidate to appear on the New Jersey ballot in 
November your student would have an opportunity at $1.00 per signature 
to receive $100.00 for a day. He would have to collect 100 signatures of 
registered voters. Transportation to/from New York is provided.)

Kind regards,

Robert
