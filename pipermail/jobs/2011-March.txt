Hi NYPHP!

This is Mike, a recruiter with CTI TEKSOURCE. I'm writing because I have a truly exceptional opportunity to share with you. My client, a top advertising exchange, with offices in NYC, is currently looking for a Technical Director to head up a new group that develops and maintains multiple sites used as feeders to bring traffic and collect information for their online advertising business. This brand new initiative is an excellent opportunity for a driven web developer looking to take the next step in their career. Please submit resumes to mmaurele at ctiteksource.com<mailto:mmaurele at ctiteksource.com> and I will follow up with a call to you. Thank you.

Details:
Reports to Director of Business Development, this role is outside of the IT organization. They have multiple sites that are used as feeders, many are games that reward winners and collect information, others are dating, coupon sites, etc. All run on Cloud Services, Amazon or RackSpace, they keep it external from their internal ad serving engine data centers. Their apps have been overloading the cloud servers from millions of user hits, need to optimize code and utilize best practices going forward. Need better integration with Facebook behind these applications as well. Need a strategic thinker that can create better ideas, games, information gathering strategies, etc.

Technology is mostly CSS, JavaScript, D/HTML, X/HTML, Flash, etc. An experienced game programmer and ecommerce developer would be great. Experience with Virtual Currency would be nice. Will have 1 report initially and can grow the team.


Sincerely,

Mike Marc-Aurele

want to talk to you. :)

Etsy is the world's most vibrant handmade marketplace. Our mission is to
enable people all over the world to make a living making things. Etsy is
growing rapidly and needs talented, motivated people to join that mission.
The growing Etsy community includes over 7.2 million members in over 150
countries. Our sellers collectively list around 7.7 million active items,
and in 2010 we sold over $300 million of goods. Etsy operates transparently
and you can check in to see how the Etsy community is doing in our monthly
weather reports.

The technical staff at Etsy believes that code is craft, good software and
systems designs are works of art, and that the work we do is part of larger
creative culture represented by the hundreds of thousands of inspired makers
who make Etsy such a wondrous marketplace. We believe that small, empowered,
self-motivated teams can do big things. We also believe in the right tool
for the job, not language-as-religion. Our current systems run PHP, Java,
Python, Ruby, Solr/Lucene, Postgres, MySQL, and more. Check out our
Engineering blog: http://codeascraft.etsy.com/

Etsy is led by CEO and co-founder Rob Kalin. We are backed by Accel
Partners, Union Square Ventures and Index Ventures; count the founders of
Flickr and Delicious as our earliest investors; and are proud to have
Caterina Fake, Jim Breyer, Stephanie Tilenius, and Fred Wilson on our
board.

*Next Steps*

We're growing rapidly and are well funded with a proven business model and
established revenue to help us continue growing and serving our community.
If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter
along with your resume telling us what inspires you about Etsy and why you
think you are perfect for the team *(resumes without a cover letter will not
be considered)*. If you contribute to an open source project, write a blog,
or practice another craft besides coding, that means something to us, and we
would love to hear about it when you write!

	& grad students
Message-ID: <4D7EA14C.8060402@panix.com>

I'll be administering some Google Summer of Code work this year, so I'd 
like to recruit students to consider applying.  GSoC details:

http://www.google-melange.com

It's never too early to start thinking about summer internships!  And 
don't worry too hard about qualifications:  
[http://www.booki.cc/gsocstudentguide/_v/1.0/am-i-good-enough/] "Do you 
have SOME programming experience at the university level? Then, yes, you 
are good enough! No, you don't need to be a Computer Science or IT 
major."  Graduate students and community college students all over the 
world are eligible: 
http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs#who 


Payment is $5000 in total.

If you already know PHP and you're interested, email me off-list so I 
can talk to you about MediaWiki, CiviCRM, or Open Web Analytics work.  
I'm administering MediaWiki's GSoC project as part of my work with the 
Wikimedia Foundation.

https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/mediawiki/wiki/Summer_of_Code_2011

If you don't know PHP, look at what organizations mentored GSoC projects 
last year 
[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2010] 
and find one that matches your skills.  Then you can contact that 
project and start talking with them about this summer.  If you don't see 
anything you like in last year's list, check the site when this year's 
mentoring orgs get announced this Friday, March 18th.

Good luck,
Sumana Harihareswara

Message-ID: <C329DBE1-9C90-427D-884D-9371262B4567@gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to preface this by saying I am NOT a recruiter and NOT in HR, I will personally be doing the interviewing/hiring for this position. 

I am looking for a mid-level PHP developer with strong web design skills.  The candidate should also have good RDMS skills (postgresql would be nice) and 
at least a passing knowledge of NoSQL solutions (MongoDB, CouchDB).  The project that you would be working on is a fairly complicated MVC based web application
that handles ticketing, inventory, domain management, and accounting.  The framework is a homegrown, in-house solution however knowledge of at least one existing PHP framework
would probably be helpful (Zen, Symfony, etc.).  We are also responsible for a few small Drupal sites and perl based applications so knowledge in those areas would be a plus. 

One of the best parts about this position is that you will be given free range to research new technologies and design projects on your own, in fact I encourage it.  I really want someone
who is willing to learn and wants to take ownership of new projects.

The company is a small managed hosting company (50 employees) located in Soho NYC.  Salary would depend on experience.

Please let me know if you are interested.

We have a chance to bid on a project that involves building an alternate version of a website for iPad consumption using custom HTML5 video player functionality.
The project would start in the next 2-3 days and would run until April 8th at which point it would need to be delivered.  There is a 50% finished HTML5 version of the site already built.
there is a flash version of the site 100% built that would be the spec for the HTML 5 work.
If you have resources familiar with HTML 5 and ideally with video in HTML5, and are interested please let me know.
It is probably 2 developers from now until April 8th to get the project done on time.

I am looking to expand my freelance business to include a junior PHP

Required skills are PHP, mySQL, javascript & of course (X)HTML.  Experience

This is something I hope to grow into a long term position, but for now it
will be job to job.

There is no location requirement, although being in Northern NY (no,
Rockland county is not NNY :)  Syracuse/Albany & north) is a big plus.

Please email your resume, portfolio & desired rates to

- Symfony / Zend / CakePHP
- Django
- Rails

.... who know how use these server-side tools to build front-ends that use:

- Javascript/CSS
- jQuery
- AJAX

... and have had to worry about

- scalability
- software architecture/reusability
- software configuration management
- system monitoring/operations

I know that a person with all these traits is hard to find - but the more of these that can be ticked off the list, the close to the ideal we get.  At some point we may look for a more junior person that hasn't had the opportunity to face all of the challenges or use all of the technologies or someone who is more design-oriented.  But right now, I'm looking for a couple of rock stars.  If this is you or someone you know please contact me ASAP!!! I look forward to speaking with you.
