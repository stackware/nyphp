<PRE>Top-tier online real estate company seeks experienced developer to join 
a team of 7. This is a growth opportunity at a stable company with 
proven revenues. We have over 25M page views/month and the department is 
doing innovative work on an ongoing basis. Full benefits are included.

The candidate should have 5 years experience although exceptions will be 
made for people just out of school as well as top-tier students looking 
for a summer internship.

Please include a cover letter indicating your experience and detailing 
specific projects on which you have worked. The successful candidate 
will be an expert in at least one of these disciplines:

* Object Oriented Programming (we use PHP5 but the real goal is OO, not 
PHP, so even Java would be applicable)
* XML
* AJAX
* UNIX (we use Linux)
* SQL (we use MySQL 5, but other relational database expertise is fine)

Please emphasize your experience with one of the skills above; the 
successful candidate will be at an intermediate level in at least 3 of 
these subjects; the goal is to find the areas in which the candidate is 
most qualified. Our team has competence in all of the above.

The successful candidate will also have experience working with teams of 
at least 3.

Other desirable skills include: Search Engine Optimization, statistics, 
Information Architecture, and possibly other areas. Masters degree is a 
plus.
