Message-ID: <C08607A44D16C44B944CE49A0D04C061017BE13F@twgsbs2003svr1.weatherlygroup.local>

Location: NY Metro--AWESOME creative, well-funded start up...

 

To move things forward then, a link to your portfolio/sites you've done,
- some OOP PHP code samples: doesn't have to be 'runnable' code, the
purpose of the request is for you to let your code speak for you. Show
us some of your best work, stuff you're most proud of - think bigger
than DB abstraction classes, forms manipulation classes, email
composition and delivery classes, pagination classes... something you
think of as impressive is what we want to see.

Description

We're a very well funded web startup with eyes on a fast and spectacular
success - in which 'very prompt return' equity is available. So if you
are a PHP developer  of high skill and experience, and you'd like the
opportunity to make bank fast, read on...

 

We're after something that is hard to find in the PHP world - a skilled
professional with banging OOP talent. We use PHP to its fullest extent
and highly abstracted - we need someone who loves to play at this level.
We're embarking on a big feature sprint, we need more talent to push
this to the next level of velocity. We have multiple development streams
producing features using a custom php framework that cuts down the
tedium, allowing you to do the interesting/challenging/beautiful stuff -
all in sustainable, maintainable and efficient coding styles of course.

 

Specifics, we're talking about you having :

- experience working with a variety of php frameworks (CakePHP, Savant,
Symfony, etc. - you won't know ours, but knowledge of others will help a
lot)

- experience building websites using highly reuseable, abstract, OOP
code

- knowledge of and experience in using the various ajax-y/dhtml
libraries out there.

- javascript creation and optimization skills  

 

You'll be a more winning candidate to us if you have:

- experience working in the Scrum Agile development methodology.

- some layout skill (you know how to float things, nest things, div
things - you don't use tables for layout.)

- experience optimizing websites for scalability (we're going to see
some major traffic here, the code must scale)

- working in a development team with people with a variety of front- and
back-end skill sets.

 

>From our side, advantages of joining us are:

- we're a startup, there's equity consideration

- we're a starup, we move very quickly and your opinions are demanded

- our office is pet friendly

- we develop on Macbook pros (well, I think it's a plus.)

- we're very capable, so you'll be in good company

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Freelance Developer for Midsize Project
Message-ID: <0453903991B16E4EB9B387ED5C6D4C460BE5E2@email.ritelite.domain>

DESCRIPTION:
I am looking for a PHP/MySQL wiz to work on a contract basis for a
midsize development project.
 
BACKGROUND:
We are a large wholesaler of consumer goods looking to build our web
presence from scratch. We maintain all products and process all orders
in-house; data is periodically exported to a MySQL database. The web
site will allow for shopping and order tracking, but not order
processing.
 
REQUIREMENTS:
The requirements, wireframes and database structure have been prepared
in detail. Contact me to request these files and I will send them to you
via email.

COMPENSATION:
After reading the specs, you'll need to give me a rough estimate of what
you expect this to cost. A projected timeline and breakdown of costs
would be helpful. We fully understand that your time is valuable and
plan to pay for good work.
 
NOTES:
1. I am quite proficient in PHP/MySQL, but I'm seeking a PHP expert that
can take the specs and run with this project. 
2. It would be nice if you used an existing MVC framework as a starting
point. 
3. If you are a good PHP/MySQL programmer this is a relatively easy gig.
Not very exciting, aside - possibly - from a small portion of search
navigation. 
4. I prefer someone local to New York - or at least within the time zone
- that I can communicate with regularly.

Thanks!

Short-term position for experienced database developer

Bennett Midland LLC seeks an experienced database developer for a
short-term quality assurance role.

We're building a PHP/MySQL application that will accept periodic data
feeds from several sources, refactor the data to build unified
records,  store them in a common database, and allow authenticated web
access to them. We're currently working on the data model and want an
outside expert to review it for logic or design flaws, and determine
whether it meets the contractual design criteria. We've allotted 3
days to the job, but if all parties are satisfied there is potential
for more work further down the line. Compensation would be on an
hourly basis and commensurate with experience.

About Bennett Midland: Bennett Midland LLC is a management consulting
firm. We work with public agencies, not-for-profits, and other civic
organizations to solve operational problems, assist with the
development and implementation of new programs, develop information
systems, and advance management strategy. We are a new firm and our
work environment is collaborative, intellectually intense, and we are
committed to outstanding results for our clients and to a rewarding
work environment.

Hi,

Our client, a growing independent Interactive agency, has projects
coming up that will include development for both Facebook & Google Maps.
This work must be completed onsite in NYC (or at the very least you must
be available to attend briefings & meetings in midtown Manhattan). These
assignments are expected to begin next month, however, start date &
duration have not yet been established. It would be ideal if one
developer could take on both projects.

Here's some information on the types of skills someone would need to do
this type of development:

Facebook:
Knows how to code/use:
**FBML (Facebook Markup Language)
**XML
**Rest Server Interface
**FQL (Facebook Query Language - similar to PHP) 
**FBJS (Facebook JavaScript) 
**Facebook API You also must have built a Facebook application
previously 
PHP experience would be a good additional skill set for the Facebook
development as Facebook Query Language is similar to PHP.

Google Maps:
Knows how to code/use:
**JavaScript
**Ajax interface
**Google Maps API
You also must have built a Google Maps web page previously

Please contact me if these opportunities look like a good fit for you or
anyone you know - 
Referrals are always welcome.

Best regards,
David
