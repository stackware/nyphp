<PRE>Who are we?

Ubersmith is a leading data center &amp; backoffice management tool 
servicing the hosting and enterprise markets. Behind every 
infrastructure company is a set of tools to help manage their network, 
servers and support - that's where we come in. Ubersmith Data Center 
Edition powers data centers and hosting companies all over the world. We 
think it's pretty cool.

Though we've been around for 8 years, our environment and our attitude 
is much more like a startup than a stodgy software service company. You 
will have the opportunity to participate in all aspects of our 
development process from planning new features through implementing and 
supporting solutions for the challenges faced by our clients. You will 
also have a fridge next to your desk.

Who are you?

  * Strong background in both object oriented and procedural 
programming. Ubersmith is written in PHP.
  * Strong SQL &amp; relational database skills, experience with MySQL desired.
  * JavaScript/Ajax/jQuery experience
  * A working *nix sysadmin knowledge.
  * Having contributed (or currently contributing) to an open source 
project is a major plus.

What do you get?

  * Fully covered Medical &amp; Dental insurance.
  * 401(k) w/ company match.
  * A conference room with a view of the Statue of Liberty.
  * 2 weeks vacation.
  * Cell phone for professional &amp; personal use.
  * Weekly lunch budget via SeamlessWeb.com
  * Free Pizza Fridays. Delicious.

What's the catch?

You MUST send a personalized and tailored letter explaining exactly why 
you think you would be a good fit for Ubersmith. My name is Dan, nice to 
meet you. Now that you know us, all form responses and Dear Sir or 
Madams will be immediately deleted.

We are a small but growing team. You will be trusted and given a lot of 
responsibility. We look forward to hearing from you.

Dan
