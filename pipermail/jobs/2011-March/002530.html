<PRE>Web performance is an important aspect of running our site. We measure just
about everything and are constantly tweaking to improve our site
performance. I'm currently hiring for two new positions on our engineering
team at Etsy for a couple of web performance engineers. One of these will
focus primarily on back-end (<A HREF="http://etsy.me/ggEYLe">http://etsy.me/ggEYLe</A>) performance and the
other will focus on front-end (<A HREF="http://etsy.me/fpG6mv">http://etsy.me/fpG6mv</A>) performance. Think you
can handle both front-end and back-end performance yourself? Then I really
want to talk to you. :)

A list of all of our job openings can be found here: <A HREF="http://etsy.me/hCU7jV">http://etsy.me/hCU7jV</A>

Both job descriptions are listed below, along with information about
Etsy. Please feel free to email me with questions about these positions.

*About Us*

Etsy is the world's most vibrant handmade marketplace. Our mission is to
enable people all over the world to make a living making things. Etsy is
growing rapidly and needs talented, motivated people to join that mission.
The growing Etsy community includes over 7.2 million members in over 150
countries. Our sellers collectively list around 7.7 million active items,
and in 2010 we sold over $300 million of goods. Etsy operates transparently
and you can check in to see how the Etsy community is doing in our monthly
weather reports.

The technical staff at Etsy believes that code is craft, good software and
systems designs are works of art, and that the work we do is part of larger
creative culture represented by the hundreds of thousands of inspired makers
who make Etsy such a wondrous marketplace. We believe that small, empowered,
self-motivated teams can do big things. We also believe in the right tool
for the job, not language-as-religion. Our current systems run PHP, Java,
Python, Ruby, Solr/Lucene, Postgres, MySQL, and more. Check out our
Engineering blog: <A HREF="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/">http://codeascraft.etsy.com/</A>

Etsy is led by CEO and co-founder Rob Kalin. We are backed by Accel
Partners, Union Square Ventures and Index Ventures; count the founders of
Flickr and Delicious as our earliest investors; and are proud to have
Caterina Fake, Jim Breyer, Stephanie Tilenius, and Fred Wilson on our
board.

*Next Steps*

We're growing rapidly and are well funded with a proven business model and
established revenue to help us continue growing and serving our community.
If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter
along with your resume telling us what inspires you about Etsy and why you
think you are perfect for the team *(resumes without a cover letter will not
be considered)*. If you contribute to an open source project, write a blog,
or practice another craft besides coding, that means something to us, and we
would love to hear about it when you write!
