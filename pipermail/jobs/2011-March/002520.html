<PRE>Seamless Receipts, Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.seamlessreceipts.com/">http://www.seamlessreceipts.com/</A> ) is looking for
experienced software engineers to join our team.

This position is full-time, onsite in our Manhattan offices. We are looking
for people with full-time, commercial experience in the following:

* Linux
* Either PHP -OR- C++
* Either MySQL -OR- NoSQL

You will have responsibility for programming website and web services tasks
in PHP as well as C++ for server software tasks. If you have experience in
both, that's great.

Please respond with a cover letter to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">allapplyhere at gmail.com</A> describing how
your skills and experience match the following:

Requirements:

If your background is mainly in PHP:

* 2 to 5 years of commercial experience programming PHP in a Linux server
environment using a PHP5 framework with a strong understanding and coding
experience with the Object-Oriented features of PHP5.

If your background is mainly in C++:

* 3-6 years of commercial experience developing C++ programs in a Win32
environment
* Knowledge of data structures and algorithms
* Experience with modern C++ techniques including templates, the STL, and/or
boost
* Strong experience with multi-threaded applications and memory management
* Object-oriented design experience
* Networking and socket programming

Strong experience and understanding of database systems. We use both
relational databases and NoSQL databases. We think NoSQL is the future, but
MySQL is still going strong.

Excellent communication skills. This is for real, not just thrown in to make
this posting look impressive. If you can't communicate your ideas and
objections clearly and persuasively, how can anyone learn from all the
wonderful things you know?

Strong knowledge of ego-less programming

Very Desirable:

* Knowledge of XML and Web Services
* Experience using a version control system such as Subversion, git or
Mercurial
* Knowledge of basic Linux system administration.
* Previous contributions to open source projects. We'll encourage and
support you in doing more of that.

Send your application to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">allapplyhere at gmail.com</A>

This is full-time, on-site only. Really.

No recruiters, please.

No H1B sponsorship is available.
