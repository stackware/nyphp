Yep. I agree. I'm beginning to think that this whole thread (nyphp-jobs) is
nothing more than a resume-collecting scheme.

 

My misguided understanding was that there were actually end-clients looking
for work to be done - and done directly by individuals that have the skills
and availability to assist them in short-term projects. 

 

OK.. I left my salutation on this. let's see who disagrees or calls me.

A large percentage of the jobs posted at least over the past 6 months 
or so, seem to be posted by recruiters with a supposed "full time" 
position such as the below.  It amounts to, effectively, a resume-
collecting scheme as you suggested, since the person below, who 
is "world class with PHP 5" and also an experienced unix admin and DBA, 
clearly does not exist.

I completely agree that the quality of the job posts is pretty poor. I 
don't think it's just the NYPHP jobs list: it's just job-posters in 
general. I've been blogging a "Hall of Shame" (mostly Craigslist posts), 
an example here:

http://realm3.com/articles/hall_of_shame_-_youtube_and_ebay_for_3500

It's obviously hit a nerve - got about 10k hits from reddit/programming 
in one day a week or so ago.

I almost wrote up a vitriolic reply to the last post to nyphp-jobs 
("PhP,  .net,  sql,  C sharp,   ajax , soap calls") but I stopped 
myself. As a favor to those of you posting jobs on this list - just 
don't do that. I've had people complain that they posted a job to the 
list and got absolutely no quality responses back, and it's no wonder 
why when posts don't contain any information about the company, are 
highly unprofessional, etc, etc. You'd think in a tight job market these 
recruiters/HR guys would put a little more effort into it.

Brian,

I agree about CraigsList -- lots of fools posting on there trying to 
get a programmer for 12 bucks an hour!!  Although I personally have had 
a lot of luck on there, and made some great long term contacts.  Sure 
no way to get rich on there, rates are not great.

With regard to the postings here by recruiters, most of the job 
descriptions are silly and don't make you want to send a resume.  They 
leave you thinking, "yuck, don't wanna work here, next!!" But the sad 
fact is that 99% of these "recruiters" don't understand a word of what 
they are cutting and pasting into these posts...it's just a bunch of 
words to them and they will get resumes and check to see if the words 
they seek are on there and if so, will forward the resume on to another 
know nothing who will possibly forward it to their client -- if the job 
actually exists.

I'd rather deal with a "mom&pop shop" where, even if rates are a bit 
lower, you can market your solution right to the people with the 
checkbook...which you do find on Craig's.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] job: Sr. PHP developer - startup - Union Square NYC
Message-ID: <487F4165.3080006@cisny.com>

Listening to the list last night and this morning, why not tell us 
recruiters, both in-house and agency, what you want to see in the ads?

I've cut this down to the bone. I've got more information but all the 
verbiage in an email isn't as good as a 10 minute conversation with me, 
and a face to face with the client company.

If you are interested, or you want more information, drop me an e-mail 
or give me a call. The number's there.

This is an employee position.

Location: Union Square, NYC
Company type: small, interactive, whose profitable business is in the 
space between e-commerce and content / ad driven.
Environment: Relaxed
The need: a strong Object Oriented PHP developer who likes to write 
complex SQL statements and can also produce excellent front end AJAX.

The team is multi-national, as is the senior management.

What will you be doing? Creating scalable websites whose hit numbers go 
from 10s of thousands to 10s of millions. Growing - expected to double 
in size in two years.

Excellent benefits.
Salary, depending on experience, to 95K + bonuses.

All replies in confidence.

I can vouch for Sumaklos....  I am one of the employees he hired.  I  
believe he found me on this list as well.

Thanks,

stuff like

Environment: Relaxed

actually means "we all wear really hideous casual clothing, and we want 
you to dress this way too, because if you're comfortable in your funny 
shorts and faded t-shirt, then we think you won't realize that you are 
working 12 hour days in a slavepit without even some non-soundproof 
cubicle walls to call your own."

This is a prime example of what you do not want to say.
Programmers don't care about dress codes.  Even if there is one, we are 
going to dress the way we want to dress anyway.

also, exactly WHAT is "in the space between e-commerce and content / ad 
driven"...?

also

Environment: Relaxed

can often mean

"Not only does our senior management LOOK like a bunch of potheads in 
their super relaxed casual wear, they actually ARE a bunch of potheads, 
and this is their first real job, and therefore while THEY may find the 
environment relaxed, you their employee will be subject to constant 
boneheaded reversals and poor decision making skills on their part 
ensuring that you are anything BUT relaxed."

Hi Brian and Kristina, 

 

I think these posts that I have been reading are great.  As a software architect who came over to the dark side and became a recruiter this is obviously very pertinent to what I am now doing.  I do think my background gives me an advantage over my competition when it comes to understanding the technology I am recruiting for. My goal is never just to get in you in front of a client and hope you get the job.  I'd rather partner with you to understand the fit and then find you the right role.  

 

Let's flip the script from the negative aspect of job postings, can you share your thoughts on what makes a great job posting?  If you think of the components of a job description as being modular i.e. company description, responsibilities, required skills and compensation/benefits.  How would you structure them?  Tightly coupled or loosely coupled :-)? What details are most important to you?  Remember, this post started when a very reputable agency in NYC posted their job description and it was shredded for needing too many skills, collecting resumes etc...

 

I would imagine there are a lot of people reading these posts from recruiting agencies, perhaps we can take something away from  this discussion to better serve the NYCPHP community.




 

Cheers,

In my view, the thing that makes me want to respond to a job posting is 
if

1.  The job description makes sense, it is a skillset that actually 
exists and not one of those "we want this person who knows all of these 
27 programming languages and can do brain surgery if things get slow" 
type roles.

2.  give me a good idea of what the actual day to day work consists of, 
what would I learn, what sort of projects are currently being developed 
there, what tools if any am I required to use, what nutcases will I be 
working with, etc...?

Compensation isn't that important to post a lot about, unless it's way 
low we all know what those market ranges are.  That +/- 100 grand is 
going to be meaningless to us unless we get a sense that this is a job 
we can be happy doing.

Kristina,

What is a person to do? If all I put into the ad is the technical 
requirement and an a brief description of what the new hire will do, I 
don't think I serve neither the hiring company nor the interested 
candidate well. I'd rather add a few descriptors about the place and 
their business. Some are teasers, some are substance. This is one of the 
things that makes communications between people interesting.

As for the two things you singled out, here's my thoughts:

Relaxed means a lot more than no dress code. It means that the manager 
isn't looking at the clock, and doesn't require a lot of face time. It 
means people work together instead of competitively. And so on.

As for the business of a company, some things are hard to precisely pin 
down in a phrase.

What's Google's business? Is it search? is it advertising? is it 
content? is it all of the above and more? How would you define it in ten 
or fewer words without giving away who the company is?

Dialog is good. If I can serve the community better and get people 
interested in the jobs I'm trying to fill, I am happy. But it's possible 
that you are trying too hard to parse an ad that is trying to telegraph 
some information without wasting a lot of time.

RDP and Vaughn:

I'm surprised by some people's reaction to this excellent job offer.  
Schematic is a top notch firm that is now owned by WPP, the world's 
largest advertising/communications firm.  I hope Ms McNulty and her 
colleagues won't be discouraged from posting jobs here in the future.

That kind of thing is part of many job postings.  Employers generally 
want to hire the best people available.  So they're saying so.

nyphp-jobs is a mailing list that you chose to subscribe to, not a 
thread on some other list.

Some of the postings are short term.  Others, like this one, offer 
full-time positions.

You make a point about explaining what a company does when you threw  
Google as an example.  However you would be hiring a person for a  
specific division or the company.

If you are hiring for the advertising position why bother telling us  
about the search aspects of the company.  Just mention that it is a  
search company that offers a wealth of services however you would be  
working with the advertising side of things.  Explain what the job  
would require.  DO NOT explain anything but the position you are  
hiring for.  Think about how you would describe the position to the  
user if you were actually the hiring manager.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

I'm usually silent throughout these rants but... 

There is no EOE (equal opportunity employment) when working with a recruiter. I'm not saying that all recruiters are bad - but they are not there to help you negotiate your salary... they are negotiating their commission. 

Recruiters will ask you "what is the least amount of salary you will accept for this position?". That same recruiter will go on to the next person and ask them the same question. They will take the lowest bidder and pass them on to their client. 

This is bad because it lowers your salary for the entire time you are employed at a company. "They" (meaning companies hiring and recruiters) love this game. Recruiters make a hefty commission and companies use part of your salary to pay them. The company hiring for the position is supposed to pay the recruiter - but they are doing it with your money. This also means that the company is getting a "bargain" because they only have to pay a recruiter once - meanwhile you are making less money than you should be for the remaining time of your employment. 

This is bad for the companies looking to fill a position because they are not going to get the best candidate for a position. They will get the lowest bidder not the most qualified person.

also

Environment: Relaxed

can often mean

"Not only does our senior management LOOK like a bunch of potheads in 
their super relaxed casual wear, they actually ARE a bunch of potheads, 
and this is their first real job, and therefore while THEY may find the 
environment relaxed, you their employee will be subject to constant 
boneheaded reversals and poor decision making skills on their part 
ensuring that you are anything BUT relaxed."

Change of pace: I run a small Web shop (six people) inside a 300 employee
non-profit health care quality improvement company. I need a PHP/MySQL Web
developer to work on report cards that educate the public on which
hospitals, health plans, nursing homes and the like perform better than
others.

The job is in Lake Success, NY, pays 65-75k, you get 6% pension contribution
which you are free to match or not, 9 public holidays, 3 weeks vacation,
excellent health benefits (we're a health care quality monitor...), flexible
work hours such as work from home or compressed work schedules. What else?
We're passionate about open source, freedom of information, health care
transparency. Yes, it's business casual. 

The job entails massaging wild data from various sources around the country
into useful, usable tools that inform the audience and stimulate
improvement. You can see our current work ay hospitals.nyhealth.gov or check
out the health care report card at nyshaf.org

We pay a little less than most for-profit companies, and we're a bit of a
pain to get to geographically, but if you're looking to get a full time job
at place that will get you Zend certified, MySQL certified, offers great job
security and helps make a difference to millions of peoples' interactions
with the health care industry give me a shout. I take this stuff very
seriously and the people who've worked here before all leave knowing a lot
more than when they came in.

Recruiters: please do not contact me, we usually cannot afford the fees.
People in other countries who want to work from other countries: please do
not contact me, this is a full time position. Contractors who think they
could do this off site please do not contact me. This is a full time job.

Otherwise, contact me with questions or if you'd like any additional info
about the gig. I have half a Web site up describing our work at www.ipro.us
which may be useful. Please put the word "simia" in your subject line when
E-mailing about this position. I'm looking for PHP 5 proficient but I'll
take anyone with a serious desire to learn and participate.

Cheers all,

Jaz

I'm surprised by some people's reaction to this excellent job offer.  
Schematic is a top notch firm that is now owned by WPP, the world's
largest advertising/communications firm.  I hope Ms McNulty and her
colleagues won't be discouraged from posting jobs here in the future.

That kind of thing is part of many job postings.  Employers generally
want to hire the best people available.  So they're saying so.

nyphp-jobs is a mailing list that you chose to subscribe to, not a

Some of the postings are short term.  Others, like this one, offer 
full-time positions.

Hi Tony,
I would like to say this before 10 or more other recruiters respond... My experience has been exactly what I've described. You can say "you're wrong" and I can't fault you for trying to defend yourselves. My intent here is not to offend anyone - but rather open your eyes to the practices of many of the recruiters that post here - and work off the major job boards.

Hey Joeseph - 



I don't want to get in the middle of all the posting on the board, but
I have to say you are entirely wrong when it comes to your
understanding how recruiters work.



I do direct placement recruiting - therefore I'm paid either a flat
fee, or a % of salary for the programmer that is hired. I would have
every motivation in the world to get my candidate a higher salary,
because in turn I would be compensated higher.



What you might be referring to is contract recruiters, where a company
gives them say $80/hr to find them a developer, and if you find one
that fits their needs for $60/hr you would get the difference in pay?
I'm not sure as I don't do this type of recruiting.. but please realize
there are many different models that people work under out there before
posting these things when you are not entirely sure how the industry
works.



Thanks,





Tony

        I'm usually silent throughout these rants but... 

        

There is no EOE (equal opportunity employment) when working with a
recruiter. I'm not saying that all recruiters are bad - but they are
not there to help you negotiate your salary... they are negotiating
their commission. 

        

Recruiters will ask you "what is the least amount of salary you will
accept for this position?". That same recruiter will go on to the next
person and ask them the same question. They will take the lowest bidder
and pass them on to their client. 

        

This is bad because it lowers your salary for the entire time you are
employed at a company. "They" (meaning companies hiring and recruiters)
love this game. Recruiters make a hefty commission and companies use
part of your salary to pay them. The company hiring for the position is
supposed to pay the recruiter - but they are doing it with your money.
This also means that the company is getting a "bargain" because they
only have to pay a recruiter once - meanwhile you are making less money
than you should be for the remaining time of your employment. 

        

This is bad for the companies looking to fill a position because they
are not going to get the best candidate for a position. They will get
the lowest bidder not the most qualified person.

Kaye,
As a developer there's a couple things I'd like to see in an ad that  
that I don't typically see.  These are the kinds of things I ask  
during an interview.  At this stage in the game mostly I'm screening  
employers, rather than being screened myself.  (That's because  
development is becoming a commodity, but that's another  
conversation....)
1.  What is the technical depth of who will become my immediate  
manager(s)?  If the people I'm going to be working with don't have a  
solid sense of the technology and they are subject to the whims and  
fads of the industry, I'm not interested in working for them.
2.  What is the management orientation?  Are they product or service  
oriented?  Do they gauge effectiveness by how many hours my butt is  
in the chair?
3.  Can they articulate a problem?  It's not really that hard, but  
I've found very few people who can.  The basics are:  The thing does  
this - I expected it to do that, and here's the steps to reproduce.   
Do you know how many times I've heard, "Make it faster", or "I want  
it to be more stable".
4.  Does the company, management team have a clear and realistic view  
of the positioning of the company?  I really really really don't want  
to work for "the next Google".
5.  Single word descriptions aren't useful, "Relaxed" doesn't give me  
any information.  If you want to describe the environment, then do so.
6.  And finally the project better be interesting.  If you need a  
PHP5 developer with 6 years of OO experience because your legacy  
codebase is so convoluted, then I'd like to know that going in.  Do  
you know how many "unsupportable" codebases I've seen? Too many.
Chris

OK.  I'd like to ask a little respect from my fellow recruiters who are
agency recruiters (I was once ago) to not use my post to this group as a
"sales call".  We have solid recruiting bench strength and "are not" using
outside resources.

 

Respectfully,

 

Sumaklos

All, I'm an employer and love the recent feedback.  We've actually hired 2
people from the list in the past 3 months (and spoken to a few others).  I
stopped posting our jobs here b/c I noticed a HUGE amount of jobs being
posted, but almost very few jobseekers posting notes that they were looking
(maybe that's not the way it works). 


--BUT--

 

If you are looking for a job in NYC (Union Square), Miami Beach (South
Beach), DC area (McLean, VA or Timonium/Baltimore, MD) then visit
www.globalpersonalsmedia.com directly to apply.  We have other offers in
California, but these are the ones we need people in.

Some other projects are:

Tony and Joseph as with any profession out there people that operate in
a less than a reputable way give the others that do not operate in that
fashion a bad reputation. Tony I am glad you responded I was going to
then thought well some recruiters do operate in that manner.

Hi Tony,
I would like to say this before 10 or more other recruiters respond...
My experience has been exactly what I've described. You can say "you're
wrong" and I can't fault you for trying to defend yourselves. My intent
here is not to offend anyone - but rather open your eyes to the
practices of many of the recruiters that post here - and work off the
major job boards.

Hey Joeseph - 

I don't want to get in the middle of all the posting on the board, but I
have to say you are entirely wrong when it comes to your understanding
how recruiters work.

I do direct placement recruiting - therefore I'm paid either a flat fee,
or a % of salary for the programmer that is hired. I would have every
motivation in the world to get my candidate a higher salary, because in
turn I would be compensated higher.

What you might be referring to is contract recruiters, where a company
gives them say $80/hr to find them a developer, and if you find one that
fits their needs for $60/hr you would get the difference in pay? I'm not
sure as I don't do this type of recruiting.. but please realize there
are many different models that people work under out there before
posting these things when you are not entirely sure how the industry
works.

Thanks,

There is no EOE (equal opportunity employment) when working with a
recruiter. I'm not saying that all recruiters are bad - but they are not
there to help you negotiate your salary... they are negotiating their
commission. 

Recruiters will ask you "what is the least amount of salary you will
accept for this position?". That same recruiter will go on to the next
person and ask them the same question. They will take the lowest bidder
and pass them on to their client. 

This is bad because it lowers your salary for the entire time you are
employed at a company. "They" (meaning companies hiring and recruiters)
love this game. Recruiters make a hefty commission and companies use
part of your salary to pay them. The company hiring for the position is
supposed to pay the recruiter - but they are doing it with your money.
This also means that the company is getting a "bargain" because they
only have to pay a recruiter once - meanwhile you are making less money
than you should be for the remaining time of your employment. 

This is bad for the companies looking to fill a position because they
are not going to get the best candidate for a position. They will get
the lowest bidder not the most qualified person.

I have had both good and bad experiences with recruiters.  Probably  
the most recent was bad because they asked me if I would be interested  
in a position with a company, explained what was needed  
technologically.  I asked for more of a company background and what  
they were going to offer for benefits etc.  They responded send me  
your resume and I will disclose that.  I sent over my resume and was  
surprised when I got a response stating that they were going to submit  
me to the company.

I responded with the question again stating that I wanted to know more  
before being submitted and they responded with only a URL.

I am hoping that someone from the hiring company actually calls me so  
I can tell them they need to find a new recruiter.

FWIW, this is a good job post.  It's conversational, personal and sounds 
like a human being on the other end, not a skillset data dump.  It tells 
me what I'd be doing.  It gives me information about the company and the 
commitment of its management.  It reveals the salary range and benefits. 
  The salary and demographics don't work for me but that's fine.  They 
haven't wasted my time and I'm not going to waste theirs.

Joseph,

This is contrary to what I know most recruiters to operate like. The
ones I worked with simply negotiate with their Client (the company
they recruit for) a percentage of the employee's salary. That is extra
and does NOT get subtracted from the future employee's salary.
Therefore, the higher your salary, the higher their commission, so it
is in their interest to get you a good pay.
I don't know how many work like that, but in my understNding most of them.

I can also attest to Jaz's post, it's real.  I have done contract work  
for IPRO in the past and they are great to work with/for.  It makes me  
wish I was in the Lake Success area.

	ongoing contract relationship
Message-ID: <5458518f0807210935q78e57671wefd6850fabdf2b8c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

We are looking for a few solid and reliable people to farm some work out
too. Right now, there's not a whole lot but we are getting more and more
calls every day so we're wanting to establish a long-term relationship with
a few quality coders who we can rely on to produce reliably.

The work is definitely not hard, deadlines are liberal, and you get to work
from home (or the beach, the bar, or wherever you decide to work from).

Here are the skills you MUST possess:

- PHP4 and PHP5 with OOP
- MySQL Basics (creating tables, using the tools, etc)
- JavaScript (fairly simple stuff: form validation, etc)
- Smarty (you need a SOLID understanding of this)
- MVC design patterns
- Experience with mid-size web application development
- You must be responsive to our needs and able to give accurate quotes on
work
- Must be fluent in English
- Must be available to communicate via an IM (doesn't matter which)
- Must have reasonable rates
- Quick turnaround time is a plus (coding, quoting jobs, etc)

If you fit these criteria, send me your resume at papillion at gmail.com or
call me directly at 918.926.0139.

Thanks!

Objective: To obtain a position in web development or in a junior system administrator position



I believe when employers read resumes they are looking for one attribute from each candidate. This attribute can be defined with one word, which is extraordinary. But anyone including myself can label himself or herself extraordinary. What makes me extraordinary is that I do something that others don?t, I go the extra mile. I am the type of person that if he is challenged to learn a new trade or a new career, I make sure that I learn everything pertaining to that field and I make the employer happy with their decision of taking me aboard their staff.

Throughout the years I have built many online businesses. Many have succeeded with profit, some failed but through each success and failure I kept striving and working towards my goals. Unlike many individuals I like the idea of being challenged and learning new trades. I have learned and designed graphics for many years, designed websites for many years, sold computers to end consumers and worked as a buyer for an electronics company. Over the years I have learned that there is two types of workers, workers who work for the money and workers who work for their career. My goal is to help your company succeed by applying my many talents and creativity to your position.. Consider
me for your position because unlike many others, I will go the extra mile and put your company in first place.

Hi,

Related to this, I'd be interested in knowing what a PHP-MySQL coder (with
maybe 3 years of good experience) would cost hourly in NY/NJ. This is for a
freelance project relating to a social networking site. I expect there to be
a couple of input forms, the routine social networking features such as
commenting, rating, & the database design. The last is very crucial to me as
I'd like the possibility of data to be mashed in assorted ways down the
road.

What should I reasonably expect to pay, & is hourly the best way to go?

Thanks!

You can't even get a freelancer overseas for $10/hr.

No wonder he's "no longer available".

Message-ID: <c7c53eda0807300643h2a6f3dd4v8c5c24ebaa6bf33@mail.gmail.com>

Certainly not $10-15 an hour, unless you want a long-term headache. My
advice would be to look at Chris Shiflett's blog entry from last year:

http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/jan/consulting-rates

There was a discussion on the NYPHP mailing list about this, too,
which is linked on Shiflett's blog:

http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2007-January/020614.html

Using Chris's formula of 2.5x hourly wages, and using Indeed.com's
average salary statistics (available here -
http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=php+developer&l1=new+york%2C+ny&tm=1 )
then 88000/2000 (50 weeks @ 40 hours) * 2.5 = $110 an hour, and more
for a "senior" developer.

This is in line with what I've seen in the city as a consultant and
developer myself.

Thanks,
- Brian Dailey

I have 10 years of experience with php and I charge $60 per hour.  I  
have seen people charge upwards of $90 per hour with the same  
experience.  I would say someone with 3 years of solid experience (if  
they really know what they are doing) should expect $30 - $40 per hour  
when doing contracting.

Joseph,

You are also in Mass. NYC is different.

Considering Chris's blog equates 60/hr to 50K with benefits...I wouldn't exactly call that the gold standard when it comes to figuring out consulting rates.

As someone noted in the comments section below where Chris called 60/hr fifty K with benefits. 60 per hour is approx 120K if you work the full year at that rate. So unless benefits cost 70K he is way off.

I have 10 years of experience with php and I charge $60 per hour.  I have seen people charge upwards of $90 per hour with the same experience.  I would say someone with 3 years of solid experience (if they really know what they are doing) should expect $30 - $40 per hour when doing contracting.

Michael,

Not only do you have to take benefits into consideration but you also  
have to take taxes into consideration so yes while you might actually  
bring in 120k per year you are not making that much.  If you are  
working under a 1099 you can bet on 33% (approx) going to taxes then  
you have to pay for health, medical, dental, office supplies etc. I  
would be surprised if you came out with $70,000 as income.  Keep in  
mind that you also have to pay utility bills such as cable,  
electricity, phone, these are all office related expenses.

33% of 124k is approx 41k going to taxes so I could see where Chris  
would get this figure.  I am sure he is accounting for more than just  
the benefits etc.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

Doesn't it also depend on how long the job is?  I have people call me for a 5-hr. job where they want to talk to me for 2 hours about it before committing to hiring me to do it.  There's also the cost of administration and accounting for your projects.

If you're on a 6+-mo. contract, working full-time for one company onsite, then your operating costs are lower.

When I have to spend a day working out hardware problems, no one is paying me for that time.  It's not easy to get a full 40 hours of billable time in one week.  You have to put in a lot more hours to bill that 40 hours -- business development, client development, administration, accounting, etc.

It doesn't really make sense to include taxes in any rationalization  
for high hourly rates, as all full time employees have to pay taxes as  
well.  However, it does make sense to say that there is a giant cost  
in risk for not having the guaranteed paycheck of full time work.

I think an NYC php coder with a CS degree and 3 years of experience  
can expect anywhere from $50-80/hour depending on the strength of  
their resume/recommendations.  I've personally paid $40/hour for  
someone who had 2 years experience and no degree.

Seriously, this is not even an isolated case...a few weeks back when I 
told someone how much I would charge, they started screaming into the 
phone "I only pay $10 an hour.  I got some guys doing this php for 
$10/hr.  $10/hr.!!" and then hung up on me.  


With regard to 1099 income, I would like to point out that if you are 
properly calculating all of your legal, allowable business expenses, 
your tax percentage will probably be somewhat under 33%.  Especially 
now with the cost of everything going through the roof, much of which 
is passthrough as 100% deductible.

If you're an employee, you company is paying half of your SS taxes and state disability.  If you work for yourself, you have to pay the entire amount yourself, which is double what you are paying as an employee.

33% of 124k is approx 41k going to taxes so I could see where Chris would get this figure.  I am sure he is accounting for more than just the benefits etc.

I have 10 years of experience with php and I charge $60 per hour.  I have seen people charge upwards of $90 per hour with the same experience.  I would say someone with 3 years of solid experience (if they really know what they are doing) should expect $30 - $40 per hour when doing contracting.

The IRS rewards us for our 1099 risk taking initiative with a long list 
of allowable business expenses which are above the line deductible.

So any tax comparison would have to be based on net income after 
expenses, because full time employees cannot deduct any work-related 
expenses in most cases.  When a self-employed person earns $75,000, I'd 
expect that there would be SIGNIFICANT expenses related to gaining that 
income, vs. a full timer's 75K being fully taxable.

Of course, that still does not make it worth anyone's time to accept 10 
buck gigs!

If you're an employee, you company is paying half of your SS taxes and state disability.  If you work for yourself, you have to pay the entire amount yourself, which is double what you are paying as an employee.

It doesn't really make sense to include taxes in any rationalization for high hourly rates, as all full time employees have to pay taxes as well.  However, it does make sense to say that there is a giant cost in risk for not having the guaranteed paycheck of full time work.  

I think an NYC php coder with a CS degree and 3 years of experience can expect anywhere from $50-80/hour depending on the strength of their resume/recommendations.  I've personally paid $40/hour for someone who had 2 years experience and no degree.

Michael,

Not only do you have to take benefits into consideration but you also have to take taxes into consideration so yes while you might actually bring in 120k per year you are not making that much.  If you are working under a 1099 you can bet on 33% (approx) going to taxes then you have to pay for health, medical, dental, office supplies etc. I would be surprised if you came out with $70,000 as income.  Keep in mind that you also have to pay utility bills such as cable, electricity, phone, these are all office related expenses.

33% of 124k is approx 41k going to taxes so I could see where Chris would get this figure.  I am sure he is accounting for more than just the benefits etc.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

Joseph,
 
You are also in Mass. NYC is different.
 
Considering Chris?s blog equates 60/hr to 50K with benefits?I wouldn?t exactly call that the gold standard when it comes to figuring out consulting rates.
 
As someone noted in the comments section below where Chris called 60/hr fifty K with benefits. 60 per hour is approx 120K if you work the full year at that rate. So unless benefits cost 70K he is way off.

I have 10 years of experience with php and I charge $60 per hour.  I have seen people charge upwards of $90 per hour with the same experience.  I would say someone with 3 years of solid experience (if they really know what they are doing) should expect $30 - $40 per hour when doing contracting.

Does anyone know of a Front End developer who would consider themselves in 
expert in DHTML.   ( I know this is PHP site but so many of you know DHTML 
extremely well)

The work is onsight in Manhattan (Downtown).   The person hiring used to 
work for our firm and is an Information Architect. 
He will talk to the person and hire off the phone. 
The project is initally slated for 3 to 4 weeks.  I have  a very specific 
description of what the project entails.   The site was initally slated to 
be done in Flash but the client wants the coding to be done in DHTML. 
Rate are open...I would entertain whatever it would take ...but I think 
$70.00 - $80.00  per hour would get it done. 
There is potentially a tremendous amount of follow up work there. 

Call me with any questions.  This is real.

This is true, but as someone else mentioned, factor in deductions, and  
the fact that SS/Medicare are a relatively small part of taxes when  
put up against the 800-pound gorilla of income taxes, and the tax  
rates are roughly similar.  It maybe be a few more % (single digit) as  
a freelancer, but they are pretty similar for comparison.  My point  
was that the risk is what makes up the higher relative rates, not just  
the risk of finding work, but the risk of doing the work and not  
getting paid!

I think susan can find someone at $10/hr if she wants a college  
student looking to scrape a few bucks together part-time, but no  
professional would take that rate.

Incorrect, it's 15.3% on the first $94K
http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98846,00.html

Also, just because something is deductable does not make it free. Also your 
two biggest costs, Retirement and Health Insurance, which are subsidized by 
the tax code for salaried employees, are NOT deductable and come straight out 
of pocket.

Self employment rate for SS/Medicare = 2 X employee rate.  Using the  
2008 number of 15.3, employee rate would be 15.3/2 = 7.65% - making my  
single digit % comment valid. http://blog.accountingcoach.com/social-security-tax/
