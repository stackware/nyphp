The company that I was working at recently closed doors so I am looking 
for some new opportunities.  I am open to working in a full LAMP stack 
and have a few years experience working with Zend Framework.  Recently 
my resume has been passed around a lot on dice.com (big mistake) so I'd 
figure I'd hit up the local NY PHP scene and see what opportunities 
there are out there.
