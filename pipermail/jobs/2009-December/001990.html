strong communication skills and the ability to translate highly technical
terms into plain English for team members and clients.

Lastly, it is critical that you are passionate about joining, not just

- Oversee and deliver quality applications on-time and on-budget; solutions
developed by the team are currently using Java, PHP, XML, SOAP, DHTML,
JavaScript, CSS and other web technologies; however, they are considering
other technologies that depend on this Chief Architect's preference 
- Develop technical and functional requirements documentation 
- Maintain current technical knowledge to support rapidly changing
technology 
- Able to work with minimum technical supervision and supplemental
engineering support 

Skills: 

- Passionate, self-driven and self-starter 
- Bachelors, Masters, or PHD degree in Computer Science or related field 
- 7+ years of software engineering and architecture experience; 3+ years
with large scale platforms 
- Strong verbal and written communication skills; ability to translate
technical terms into plain English 
- Experience with large distributed applications and building/operating
highly available systems 
- Experience writing software that communicates directly with 3rd party
software (APIs, automation scripts) 
- Strong experience with data structures, algorithms, databases, and
enterprise systems 
- Able to adapt to new development environments and changing business
requirements 
- Experience developing large scale SaaS systems 
- Works well in a team environment and able to effectively drive cross-team
solutions that have complex dependencies and requirements 
- Able to handle multiple competing priorities in a fast-paced environment 
- Authorization to work in the U.S. 

Pluses: 

- Previous startup experience 
- Transactional-based platform experience 
- eCommerce experience 
- Sales Engineer experience (they love this) 
- Sense of humor 

TO APPLY: The absolute best way to apply for this job would be to not only
submit your resume and salary requirement, but to elaborate on how your
experience relates to the job description to
