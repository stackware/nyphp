My client has an order form that, when it is filled out by the end user,

  Great opportunity in fast-paced shop for the right

Moshe,

It's probably best to contact the job poster directly.  Some job positions are posted to the list by non-members, and so they won't see messages that go only to the jobs list.

I bet he tried. We mangle the Reply-To header to be the list address, so he
probably just didn't think to change the address after clicking reply (since
this is not a normal step to take).

While I understand the arguments for and against mangling headers, it seems
like it might at least be best to not do so on the jobs list.

Thoughts?

Chris

Good call, especially since this is the only list that accepts posting from non-members; I'll make the change now.

Thanks Chris,
