Message-ID: <0MKp8S-1Kx1G538CH-0001V2@mrelay.perfora.net>

Hey everyone,

This may be opening a can of worms, but what would you say is a reasonable
hourly rate for the following developer:

- 5+ yrs experience with PHP/MySQL (inc. understanding of MySQL query
optimization with complicated JOINs, etc)
- Good knowledge of various MVC frameworks
- Strong HTML/CSS/JS/XML skills
- Understanding of W3C standards
- Basic Linux server administration
- Strong e-commerce experience

All provided references have sung his praises. The position would be taking
over development of a PHP e-commerce web site. Includes bug fixing, creating
new features, etc, on a somewhat regular basis. Also includes writing
front-end (XHTML valid HTML/CSS with JS framework for effects), managing SVN
and maintaining the web site's dedicated server.

Any idea on what range we should expect to pay?

Thanks,

- Nathan

If it's a good developer, I'd say about $120/hr for a wider range of skills.

(This is for a 1099 job, not a full-time position.)

Message-ID: <E8A1E1EC7C224A9291700CA7BD36D15E@EMACHINE>

Job Title: Senior Engineer 
Location: New York City - Relocation assistance provided 
Salary: $150,000 - $250,000 per year + benefits 

Entrepreneurial. Challenging. Exciting. Fun. Innovative. Edgy.
Distinctive. Sound like an interesting job? 

Our company was born out of a passion for bringing information to
consumers. We began with the mission of providing a smarter directory
assistance solution to telecom companies, so they could pass on a better
and lower priced service to consumers. As a natural extension of our
mission, we built our own market leading information brands in Europe
and extended our services into text messaging as well. We have recently
embarked on a new brand identity which reflects our desire to extend our
brand presence to the US and merge our multiple information services
under one umbrella. What will never change is our commitment to
persistent innovation so we can always provide our customers with the
best information experience possible. 

With our renewed identity, we setup a high priority intrapraneurship
effort, a web start-up nestled within a larger organization, to launch
our brand into the web and mobile space. This offers us the best of both
worlds: the stability and resources of our parent, with the culture and
agility of a startup. 

We aren't looking to create some fad products, but rather major
newsworthy and landscape changing products, backed by an extensive
marketing budget.  We are an eclectic group of intelligent, interesting,
and fun entrepreneurs with a passion for groundbreaking ideas. The
project is still in its early stages, so all hires have an immediate
opportunity to have a major impact and enjoy rapid career development. 

We operate out of our own Flatiron area loft-space, with an evolving fun
and energetic culture, and a growing list of amenities.  We hope that
all hires will take an active role in helping us define the culture of
our company. 

As a Senior Developer, you will be a foundational member of the core
technology effort, working intimately with the CTO and other senior
developers.  Gradually, as the team grows, there will be opportunities
to lead and manage a team of developers, if desired.  Right now, we
really need some hard-core builders.  If you're looking to change the
landscape of the internet with your own two hands, this is a great
opportunity for you. 

RESPONSIBILITIES: 

* Develop, design and maintain web services to support all aspects of a
highly data-driven product 
* Create and implement algorithms to handle distributed server-side data
processing 
* Create solutions to parse and extract useful information from
web-scale structured and semi-structured sources of data 
* Work as a key member of a small, passionate, highly-skilled team 
* Utilize agile methodology, but work independently as needed 
* Work comfortably in a face-paced start-up environment 
* Work comfortably on multiple projects simultaneously 

SKILLS: 

* Text and data mining 
* Distributed data processing 
* Technologies we use and love (you should too): 

o Python, Ruby, PHP 
o Systems written in Java, C++ 
o RESTful services 
o Linux 
o Perl (only in emergencies) 

* Familiarity with web standards 
* Firm understanding of core web technologies (http especially) 
* Ability to properly document code and processes 
* iPhone, Blackberry or Android experience a PLUS

We are looking for a full time senior PHP application developer with
exceptional talent, an abundance of energy, and a high-degree of
self-motivation.  We are a fast growing, ambitious company in an
emerging market, making this a challenging position not suitable for
novices.   We are the leading provider of multivariable testing
solutions for companies doing business on the web. We help our clients
maximize their conversion rates online through real-time testing of
landing pages, registration pages, and other points of customer
interaction.  The ideal candidate has expertise in the areas of: 



Core Skills 

*        PHP  - 5 + years of  experience 

*        MySQL  - 5+ years of experience   

*        JavaScript  - 5 + year of experience  

*        Application architecture and design in a high performance

*        Ajax

beneficial. 

Excellent written communication, organizational, and time-management
skills and a strong competitive nature are required.
