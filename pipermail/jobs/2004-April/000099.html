<PRE>I'm looking for a fairly experienced PHP developer to work for a small NYC
software company. The intent is to find someone who can eventually replace
me as I phase myself out and move on.

What's cool about the job:
--------------------------
* The company is constantly innovating, striving to remain ahead of the
curve. Currently, the software consists of eDonkey2000 and Overnet, both
of which are very popular P2P file sharing clients (the eDonkey network is
the 2nd largest file sharing network in the world -
<A HREF="http://www.slyck.com/">http://www.slyck.com/</A>). A new product is in development.
* The work environment is very casual, the hours are flexible, and the
people here are clueful. It's a rare combination. You can get a lot done
in a short amount of time.
* There are no meetings.
* You get to work on a pure LAMP platform. No Windows.
* You get to deal with traffic that few people ever experience. We serve
well over 10 million requests a day, accounting for over 5 terabytes of
data a month. Any bottleneck you write in PHP will be exposed quickly, and
any inefficient design you create will never work in the first place. You
will be working in an environment that forces a disciplined approach to
PHP development.
* You see your work mentioned on Slashdot frequently.
* You're always in the news. We've even had camera crews from Germany
visit the office and interview us. I get emails from reporters all the
time.
* You get to be the target of DDoS attacks:
<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/07/kazaa_attack_prelude/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/07/kazaa_attack_prelude/</A>
* You're right in the middle of the ethical debates surrounding file
sharing and copyright infringement.
* You work in an office very near Union Square.

What's cool about you:
----------------------
* You're both smart and creative. A big part of the interview process is
solving generic puzzles, and this is considered more important than
syntactical knowledge. Creative thinkers are rare treasures.
* You love PHP, Linux (Red Hat 9 currently), Apache, and MySQL.
* You can play the role of an administrator for any of these.
* You have a fair amount of PHP programming experience and understand very
well how the Web works.
* You have a pretty good grasp of Web application security.
* You can administer CVS and email for the other employees.
* You're happy and eager to learn anything you don't already know.

There are some things of lesser importance, such as the ability to make a
Cisco LocalDirector do your bidding, but if you're the type of person
we're looking for, you can pick these types of things up as you go along.
We're actually much more interested in finding the right person than we
are at finding someone who happens to meet a specific checklist of
buzzwords.

While I'm not looking for formal cover letters, I would like to have a
personal email accompanying your resume (any format is fine) - just a
little something describing why you think this job might be a good thing
for both you and the company. You're also welcome to email me any
questions you have.

Thanks.

Chris
