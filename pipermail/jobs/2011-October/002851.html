<PRE>Web Designer

The Visionlearning project (www.visionlearning.com), a National Science
Foundation and U.S. Department of Education funded science education
website, is currently seeking an experienced Web Designer who will analyze
our current site and work with existing staff to redesign and launch a new
site that better meets our user and staff needs.  Specific activities
include:

.         Thoroughly analyze the existing site to determine strengths and
weaknesses with regard to usability and engagement on both front and back
ends;

.         Interview staff members and review user metrics to determine how
the site is currently used;

.         Develop a new, engaging, and functional design based on these
analyses and discussions with project staff;

.         Work directly with Programmers and Project Managers to implement
the new design in a timely manner.

The project is looking for a significant, long-term commitment from an
experienced web designer who will assist in the management of an extensive
site overhaul. A preliminary list of objectives of this overhaul, with
including deliverables related to this position is available for download at
www.visionlearning.com/objectives.pdf. We envision the position as part time
(~20 hours per week), or contractual with a significant weekly commitment,
with annual compensation in the range of $40-$50K, depending on experience.
The project is headquartered in Manhattan in New York City, and significant
time on site is expected. The position requires extensive web design
experience, the ability to implement designs in HTML/CSS, and the capacity
to work with software developers to integrate these into the current
PHP-based codebase. The position also requires the capacity to integrate
staff needs with user needs into a design that encourages interactivity, as
well as to test and troubleshoot the implementations in current standard
browsers. Knowledge of current new media trends is required, and experience
designing for the college educational sector, particularly for undergraduate
students, is highly desired.

To apply, please send a cover letter, resume, at least two relevant design
samples, and the names of three references to Heather Falconer,
<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">hfalconer at visionlearning.com.</A> Applications received by November 15th will be
given preference.

Visionlearning.com provides high-quality, accessible, educational content in
the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines at
the introductory undergraduate level. Our free materials, targeted to both
students and educators, make available peer-reviewed, bilingual content that
not only explores specific STEM concepts, but examines how we have come to
understand them, the people who have contributed to our understanding, and
the ongoing research that builds our scientific knowledge. By utilizing the
Internet and new media, and incorporating both the history of science and
process of discovery in all of our learning modules, we aim to improve
student understanding of science, promote multi- and inter-disciplinary
teaching, and provide a community foundation for those interested in
improving STEM education.
