Company
LanguageMate(r) is a leader in the development of cutting edge informatics solutions that address challenges throughout the care delivery continuum, including patient-provider communication, workflow management, and outreach to diverse populations. Operational constraints in clinical practice and health education contribute to many of the medical errors, unnecessary costs, and inadequate preventive care practices that result in adverse health outcomes and persistent inefficiency in the healthcare system. By delivering innovative solutions, we support all stakeholders with tools that facilitate community engagement, streamline provider and administrative workloads, and elevate the quality of patient care. Since 2004, the National Institutes of Health has awarded our team over a dozen Small Business Innovation Research grants to develop a portfolio of highly innovative tools and a growing body of rigorous scientific evidence to demonstrate their efficacy, adoptability, and long-term sustainability. Our team consists of clinicians, public health researchers, educators, linguists, and anthropologists working closely with professionals in information technology, interactive design, multimedia production, and business management. We take tremendous pride in our work, which enables patients and service providers to transcend the barriers of language, culture, technology, and geography.
