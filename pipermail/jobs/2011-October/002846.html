<PRE>Hello All, 


I am currently looking for a PHP Developer to work on site with a client
in Roseland, NJ. My client is a Fortune 500 company that is currently
starting a new group which will be responsible for all new technology
and mobile initiatives. This will be the best of both worlds as you will
be working for a large very stable company but in a start up
environment. This is a highly collaborative group and you will be in a
brand new portion of the office that they are currently in the process
of renovating!

 

This is a contract to permanent opportunity. I have included a brief
description of the skill set they are looking for below and would love
to talk to anyone who is interested.

 

I can also offer a $600 referral fee to anyone if you refer a friend and
they get the job.  


Please send your resume to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">dgordon at anteogroup.com</A> 

 

Thanks!
