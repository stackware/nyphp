<PRE>Hey Everybody--
    We're hiring at Thrillist for backend developers of any level and
wanted to get word out to the NY PHP Community. Job description below.
Email us at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at thrillist.com</A> (and mention the jobs list!)

    Thrillist, JackThreads, and our newest family member, Thrillist
Rewards are scaling rapidly and building a team of hardcore
programmers to match our lofty ambitions. We&#8217;re looking for
programmers of all levels, preferably with experience using PHP and
MySQL. If you&#8217;re comfortable with jQuery, that is even better. Our
systems&#8217; &#8220;cores&#8221; are Drupal 6 and CakePHP, so experience with those is
a definite plus. Other technologies we work with are MongoDB, Solr,
PostgreSQL and Amazon Web Services. If you have Sys Admin chops, we
definitely want to hear about it.

    On a daily basis you could be working on projects big and small &#8211;
handling upgrades to a massive email campaign and send reputation
system or working on our mobile API (because after all, we also have
to support the backend for our iPhone, iPad and Android apps.) This
position requires both design and implementation work. We&#8217;ve got a
bunch of cool applications in development, some large, some small.

    We expect a ton out of our team, and because of that, we want to
make sure you&#8217;re as happy as can be. We have a conference and book
budget for continuing your education, team lunches, dual monitors and
brand new iMacs (want a PC? Let us know and we can make it happen.) We
make sure to keep our coffee machines brewing all day and have
situated Nerf weaponry around our offices for the impromptu dart war
(did we mention the Nerf budget?). Don&#8217;t forget the normal benefits,
too: competitive salary, health insurance, sick days, vacation days
and as you spend more time with our team, flexible work hours and work
place. Naturally working at Thrillist means you get access to some
pretty cool Thrillist events and occasional product (booze)
presentations right in our office.

If you&#8217;re interested and ready to start down a path sure to end in
fame and likely debauchery, send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">techjobs at thrillist.com.</A>

Thanks!
