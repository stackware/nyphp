<PRE>Note: This is a Full Time, On-Site position with benefits. We will also consider full-time on-site contractors.

Celebrate independence day by leaving behind boring, slow moving companies and hyped-up startups that will burn through funding in six months. 

Bandwidth Productions is a Webby Award winning web development/design firm looking for someone to lead development on our custom content management system and build custom applications that are used by our clients. No politics, no bureaucracy, no dead weight and plenty of autonomy. We've been profitable since 2001 with a roster of long time, loyal clients.

We offer a competitive salary, 100% free health/vision/dental benefits, 401k (with company match) and regular hours that allow you to have a life outside of work. This is an opportunity to build something, not just be a drupal/wordpress customizer or a cog in a large machine. 

YOUR ROLES:

You will spend half of your time building and maintaining applications for our clients (visit BandwidthProductions.com for an overview). Applications range from full scale content management systems to complex e-commerce systems, video galleries and beyond. The other half of your time will be spent further developing and refining our core content management system and turning it into a shippable product. 

WHO YOU ARE:

The following skills are REQUIRED: 
 
1. Experience building complete applications using PHP/MYSQL using an MVC framework.  Examples might include a custom content management system you built from scratch, a store catalog system, a news manager, membership/registration system, etc.
 
2. Proficiency in Javascript, HTML, CSS, XML
 
The following skills are A PLUS: 
 
1. BS in Computer Science or related field
2. Experience integrating with payment gateways like Authorize.net, Paypal, etc.
3. Experience in configuring and managing LAMP based servers which may include:
 . Familiarity with issues around scaleability 
 . use of RPM or other package managers
 . Experience in Pear package use and installation
 . Familiarity with software firewalls, such as iptables 
 
4. Experience with cloud services e.g. Amazon S3/EC2 or Rackspace Cloud

Contact: <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">jobs at bandwidthproductions.com</A>
 
Send resume with URLs and/or descriptions of relevant web applications you've developed, describing your duties and responsibilities. 
 
ABOUT THE COMPANY:
 
Bandwidth Productions, Inc. is a small, very active web design and development agency located in Chelsea, NY (26th and 7th). We provide end-to-end web solutions from design to development to hosting. We also produce FIQL.com, a popular music playlist social network wholly owned and operated by us. We have been around since 2001 and have been profitable from day one.
