Ok, ok... Since this is the NYphp list!

I know _plenty_ of out of work American programmers with excellent
communication skills and tons of experience who would certainly work for
$45-$50 an hour.  People that are only a local call away who can jump on the
subway to come visit you. 

Feel free to contact me and I will try to put you in touch with them.

My bad.. I apologize for the followup post to Mr. Jagtap's job request.
The reply was meant to be a joke (signed Ay Jo Kur), but it seems to have
spawned a flood of off topic replies which are upsetting people. Perhaps
we could migrate the outsource-bashing posts to another list or end
it here altogether?

Again, sorry...

Hi,

The NY Botanical garden uses KE Emu (from http://www.kesoftware.com) to
manage it's herbaria collections.  KE Emu is a complex, sophisticated object
database application with a rich windows-OS gui.  Sadly, it is closed
source.

BUT...

Emu has a built in web-portal tool for sharing database data built in
OO-PHP...

We are in the process of putting together a demo version of our web portal
and need help with customization...

KE provides a lot of PHP files out of the box but it's up to us to customize
and thus we need your help.

We're seeking someone with deep OO PHP-fu, solid understanding of Object
Databases and good design/information architecture instincts.

We envision this work lasting anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks depending on the
usual variables...

To begin with, you would work on site here with us in the Bronx but I can
imagine you working off-site some too.. BUT.. you MUST be based in the NY
metro area.  Metro north comes right to the garden.  Also, there's ample
parking if you drive.  Lastly, the D train is not far away from here.

Please contact me ASAP with a your rates (hopefully they're negotiable..
we're a poor but eminently respeced and referencable non-profit)  resume,
code samples/online examples of your work, and references.

We wish to begin asap.

Thanks!

Joshua

	Opportunity)
Message-ID: <10672170.1077891712639.JavaMail.www-data@six.oddpost.com>

SENIOR PHP DEVELOPER / PROJECT MANAGER 
  
An early stage funded startup seeks an individual consultant as project manager and senior developer for an open-source based web application that will serve as the core of the company's business.  The application will include significant commerce and order management functions and will be used both by consumer and business users across the internet.  It has already been architected with data model, functional architecture and systems plan in place. 
  
The consultant must have demonstrated experience building scalable open source web applications (PHP/MySQL/Apache/Linux) including: building development teams, leading development efforts, and exceptional hands-on coding.  The individual will work directly with senior management (CEO and two technology executives) and one already-engaged senior developer to ensure overall application success and should thrive in a focused but entreprenurial environment. 
  
This individual will serve two key roles on the team: 
1) play a senior developer role to code significant portions of the application; and, 
2) project manage a 3-4 person development team to execute the development, testing and launching of the application (including significant people management and significant scheduling/budgeting/scope management responsibilities) 
  
The initial opportunity is for a 3-4 month full time engagement beginning as soon as possible.  The position structure is as follows: 
? Independent contractor 
? Full-time dedication during full duration of project 
? No telecommuting; must be on-site, in New York City (office near Union Square) 
? 3-4 month build/test/launch/manage cycle 
? Will require significant night and weekend effort
