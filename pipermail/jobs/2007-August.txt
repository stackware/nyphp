Message-ID: <90174f6c0708081256x95ef199tbfcc3a8b51300f33@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

Pando (my employer, an established, VC funded p2p startup located in
Soho, NYC) is hiring another web person. Here's the Craigslist
posting:

http://urltea.com/16b8

We're looking for someone who groks web standards (html /css);
unobtrusive javascript; php; flash/actionscript. You don't need to
know everything if you have a good foundation in a few web
cornerstones.

We use Drupal quite a bit (and would more if I wasn't spread so
thin!), so this is a great spot to make a huge impact as an aspiring
Drupal developer or themer. We're also using CodeIgniter and jQuery
heavily, so experience with those two tools also a plus.

On-site only.

If you have questions you can (informally) email me at scott -AT-
pando -DOT- com. When you apply, let us know you heard it from me. ;)

Scott

 As usual I?m representing an absolutely amazing Senior PHP/MySQL

Design.  He also has 6-months experience with PHP 5 (side work as a

PERL - 7.5 years
HTML - 9 years
JavaScript - 9 years
CSS - 9 years
Oracle - 8 years
Linux - 7.5 years
Other: AJAX, ASP, PEAR, CGI, XML

One of the key factors in my candidates job change is normal working
hours (no late nights/weekend work, etc), great benefits and challenging
work.  He is looking for a new job because his current employer has no
vision to move from PHP 4 to PHP 5.

If you would like to see my candidate?s resume, please contact me

Please be aware that my candidate is senior level with a senior level

Hello all!

 

First I would like to present you guys with a PHP Developer position right
here in Manhattan, NY.  The position is a senior level position which will
be a team lead.  The environment is LAMP based and is for a company that
specializes in digital publishing.  Preferably someone that has worked in
web environments would be ideal but the big key to the position is the
ability to lead a team.  Even if you don't have experience leading teams
send me your resume or give me a call to discuss the position and company in
depth and we can talk about where you see yourself professionally in the
future.  Salary is open.

 

Secondly the other position is located in Westport, CT.  It is a stretch
here from Manhattan but any located in the Bronx would have an easy commute
(the company's offices are located right near the train station in Westport,
CT).   The position is senior level and would be for a company that is an
established new media company that is looking to leverage a lot of open
source technologies in the framework they are building.  I do have a more
formal spec for the position and it is as follows:

 

Overview:

PHP/MySQL developer for a well-established multimedia company.

 

Responsibilities:

* Custom PHP/MySQL coding (e.g., Drupal modules and custom db queries)

* Website architecture planning

* Work with Project Manager to create Scope of Work, requirements analysis,
etc. for client projects by providing technical details and estimates.

* Code review

* Installation and configuration of Drupal-powered websites

* Patch existing modules for additional functionality

* Security updates

* Client contact throughout development process

* Work closely with the rest of our development team

 

Qualifications:

* PHP and MySQL experience required (preferably PHP 5 and MySQL 5)

* Working knowledge and experience with Drupal strongly preferred (interest
and ability to learn Drupal API and participate in the Drupal community
required)

* Unix/Linux, Apache, server administration knowledge a plus

* Knowledge of AJAX, JavaScript, XML a plus

* Experience creating client documentation (requirements, scope of work,
etc.)

* Superior written and verbal communication skills

* Client relations skills

* The ability to finish a project 100% to customer satisfaction

 

Keep in mind all resumes sent to me are confidential and will not leave my
desk without your permission.  I hope to speak with quite a few members of
this mailing list.

Hi there:

I'm the lead technologist for an online store whose traffic needs  
have increased recently.

We've recently added a second server which I would like to use to  
serve up our images statically using squid.  I need some help  
installing and configuring squid to pull images automatically from  
our main server.  Our server is running Redhat Enterprise Linux 4,  
and we'd like to run the latest stable version of squid.

I realize this is a small gig, but if anyone's got a spare afternoon  
(or whatever you need), and has the necessary knowledge, please  
contact me at suzerain at suzerain.com.

Reply with a quick explanation of your experience, and your hourly rate.

Cheers,

networking.  Additionally any added experience with XHTML/CSS/Ajax is a
plus!.  If you are interested send me you resume and I will get in contact
with you to discuss the company and position in depth.  The position is not
a telecommute nor can the company sponsor H-1 or other Visa's at this point.
Additionally no third parties.

 

Best regards,
