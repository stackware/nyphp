About AdCloud: 

Founded in 2009 by established advertising and technology industry vets
with over 35 yrs of experience, AdCloud has found a new way to create a
very large network of computers to display ads faster and cheaper than its
traditional competitors.  The new technology is called &quot;cloud computing&quot;
and is rapidly being adopted across many of Silicon Valley's leading
start-ups and large established companies to reduce large closets and
farms of servers and expensive computers.  This reduces capital investment
required to get a business up and running and permits AdCloud to pass
along the savings to customers and suppliers - operating efficiently and
with a very small staff relative to its competitors.
