<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>AppNexus is an online advertising technology company with headquarters in Manhattan. We are a dynamic and entrepreneurial company focused on building a game-changing ad and cloud computing platform designed to push our industry to new levels of efficiency and spend. Our team members come from such companies as Yahoo/Right Media, Google/DoubleClick, and Goldman Sachs. The business is thriving, and we are looking for outstanding people to join us.
We are looking for a software engineer with solid object-oriented PHP5, and Web-Services Design experience to become a core member of a sharp, dynamic team. AppNexus clients trade on a steady stream of online media through our real-time transactional platform, a distributed system built on top of the AppNexus computing cloud that responds in a few milliseconds to billions of requests each day - 24/7, 365 days a year.
We need an efficient and agile engineer motivated by solving interesting technical challenges and building new applications quickly. Our team is rapidly developing RESTful APIs four our clients, functionality, and tools for our platform.
The position requires a problem solving mindset as much as it requires strong PHP, API design and scalable and maintainable software development skills. The ideal candidate is hands-on when designing applications and is comfortable coding off of a problem statement instead of a formal spec. Our environment is open, collaborative, and encourages learning. We release new code at least once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases reliability), so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and confident in your work. You'll immediately see the results of your work and creativity - as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world at large.
Requirements
*        2-5 years of production development experience
                                  *        Proficiency in Object Oriented PHP 5, experience working with MVC frameworks
                                 *         Experience with server side application development and web-services, especially REST
                    *         Experience with building large-scale, high-volume web-services
                    *         Proficiency in SQL and experience with MySQL.
*        Experience with writing unit tests within a testing framework
*        Experience in LAMP development and version control
*        Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24/7 environment

For all positions, the compensation package includes a competitive base salary, health, dental, 401k, and vacation time. Interested? Please send a resume and cover letter to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">careers at appnexus.com</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">careers at appnexus.com</A>&gt; or to the email address attached to an individual job posting.
