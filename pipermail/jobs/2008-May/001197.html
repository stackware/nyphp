<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>If you are interested in relocating to sunny Sacramento, CA and want to 
work in a 100% PHP/MySQL focused company,
we have two positions available for qualified candidates. Sorry no 
telecommuting or outsourcing opportunity available.

Our company  has been completely focused on PHP/MySQL based Web 
application development since the beginning.
We have developed our own in-house PHP framework that we will soon make 
available to the open source community. We have two
tracks:  product development and client subscription services. Our 
product development track is dedicated to developing pop/culture centric 
Web 2.0 products.
So far, we have built one of the hottest Web properties for network 
television companies. Our product development track is geared towards 
spinning of
new Web 2.0 products and thus key employees potentially have a great 
upside in case of product spin offs as separate ventures. Our other track is
subscription based Web application development, hosting and maintenance. 
Since we focus on product development more than custom projects, you would
be effectively working on potentially highly rewarding Web products.

Oh, did I mentioned that we also publish books on LAMP platform? So far 
we have published a dozen books on LAMP!
Interested?

Job Qualifications:
BS or MS in computer science or engineering or equivalent degree
1+ Years of object oriented PHP experience
