<PRE>Schematic, one of the nation's leading interactive agencies, is seeking
a world-class PHP Software Developer to join our New York team.
Headquartered in Los Angeles with offices in New York and Atlanta, we
provide award-winning user interface, design and technology solutions
for the Web, advanced devices and television. Schematic develops across
a wide array of platforms including set-top boxes, game consoles, mobile
devices, and the Internet. We have recently developed projects with EA,
Microsoft, Amp'd, Comcast, Fox, Intel, Motorola, and MTV, among others.

 

Software Developers lead and work with project teams to architect,
design, and develop systems.  Ideal candidates will have a minimum of 5
years experience creating large-scale web applications with PHP 5 and
MySQL or PostgreSQL. Experience with object-oriented PHP is required,
and you must be able to architect complex applications, write
well-structured classes, and have a solid working knowledge of
inheritance, interfaces, design patterns, MVC, XML, templating, caching,
sessions, authentication and abstraction.

 

You must also be comfortable working from the Unix command line, Apache
web server, and should be familiar with team-based production scenarios,
using CVS or subversion and bug reporting tools such as Mantis. An
excellent grasp of SQL is a must, and you should have experience
administering relational databases, as well as creating and maintaining
sophisticated databases and tables, and handling database transactions.

 

Development experience using other programming languages (Perl, Java,
Ruby, ActionScript, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, XML/XSL etc) and an
understanding of a formalized design methodology such as UML are
definite pluses.

 

Responsibilities:

 

- Participation in all aspects of the development life cycle (design,
implement, test, document, and deploy)

- Maintain high standards of quality for code, documentation, and
deliverables

- Work with project managers and development teams to create
timelines/schedules

- Interact with business teams and clients to provide technical
expertise and feedback

- Evaluate new technologies/tools as needed

- Mentor junior developers

- Maintain and update codebases for legacy applications

- Clearly communicate technical ideas and decisions to both technical
and non-technical audiences

 

Applicants should email techjobsny at schematic dot com with a resume in
plain text, RTF or PDF (no other formats will be opened). Include a
cover letter outlining your skills and experience in the email. This
position is full-time/permanent, on-site in our New York office. No
out-of-town candidates will be considered. No recruiters please.
