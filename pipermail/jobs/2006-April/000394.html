<PRE>Sinu seeks a SuperStar Lead Developer

Sinu is looking for our superstar lead developer.   This position would be
the lead development position working in a small effective team to bring
magic to the solutions our customers use every day.

Sinu's solutions are mostly PHP but we would also like to begin introducing
RoR where applicable.  So we would be a great place for someone looking to
explore the Rails world.

The ideal candidate for this position can be described by the following
list:
- Can handle being the authority on all development and architectural
decisions for our technology platform
- Can organize, project manage, shuffle and effectively deliver on ten plus
simultaneous projects both in-house and outsourced
- Is able to coordinate outsourced developers across the country.
- Great communicator, especially in writing.
- Can work well with our full time project manager to ensure that
development projects are in sync with projects in other areas of the
company.
- Values integration more than building from scratch
- Is comfortable gliding in and out of various technologies and languages
(PHP, Perl, MySQL, RubyonRails, ShellScripts, SOAP, XML, REST, Atom, RSS,
Wiki, Javascript, HTML, Ajax)
- Knows how to build secure systems without leaving loose ends that can come
back and bite us later
- Is familiar with security identity and encryption technologies (SSH, SSL
Certificates, Identity Solution, Infocard, Yadis)
- Is a fan of web based solutions (especially: Basecamp, Writely, JotSpot,
Box.net, Sproutit, DabbleDB) and their integration into other tool sets
- Loves working in Tribeca, NYC
- Gets a kick out of making outsourced IT a lot less boring
- Is looking to work with small team in a small company with huge potential
- Has a four year college degree in an interesting field other than Computer
Science or Engineering

If you are this person,  then there is a job waiting for you.   If you are
close,  show us why we should hire you.

Please email your one page resume and a cover letter explaining your
understanding of what Sinu does and how your experience and knowledge can
help us achieve our company goals.

Send emails to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">jobs at sinu.com</A>

Resumes of more than one page will not be considered.   Please send links to
online descriptions of recent projects you have worked on that showcase your
talents.

If you are not close to what we are looking for,  show us why we should
consider you.   We promise not to waste your time.   You will know within a
week of us receiving your email whether you are on the short list for an
interview.   We are looking to fill this position soon.

Sinu offers full health care and dental as well as a full benefits package
including life insurance, 401K and many other nice extras like continuing
education.
  Salary will be proportional to experience and how much immediate value you
bring to the company.

Sinu is a great place to work,  we hope to hear from you soon.

-Larry
