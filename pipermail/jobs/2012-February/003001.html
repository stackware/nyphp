<PRE>Senior Software Engineer/ Team Lead

Company:

An early-stage well-funded start-up in New York is looking to hire a 
senior software engineer / team lead.

Who we are:

An innovative new platform for searching and shopping in-store products 
on mobile devices.

We&#8217;ve been live for just a few months but have seen strong growth and 
have already been featured as &#8220;What&#8217;s Hot&#8221; on the App Store homepage in 
over 120 countries. We have also been featured in Tech Crunch, WSJ, 
Forbes, AllThingsD, Next Web, Business Insider, Fox News, etc.


Position:

We&#8217;re currently looking to bring on our Senior Back-end Engineer, who 
will lead our engineering efforts.

The ideal candidate would have strong knowledge of back end software 
engineering and is excited by all things data related.


Responsibilities:

* Ship back-end code using PHP and other tools, as needed, and in a 
timely manner
* Write clean, maintainable code that performs and scales well
* Help run the daily Scrum and related processes
* Assist the team in making important architectural decisions, the 
hiring process, etc.
* Collaborate with founders and other contributors to define, scope, and 
undertake new projects



Requirements:

* BSCS or equivalent experience
* 5+ years of software development experience
* Immersion in open-source with experience in PHP, Ruby or Python
* Experience with databases, such as MySQL and perhaps noSQL (SDB, 
Mongo, etc.)
* An understanding of scalable web architecture and technologies, 
particularly when applied for consumer/mobile applications
* Hands-on experience running Linux systems in Amazon EC2 or another cloud
* Experience working in small distributed engineering teams, using the 
Scrum process



Even better if you have:

* Day-to-day front end web programming experience, using HTML, 
Javascript, CSS
* Domain experience/interest in social or commerce
