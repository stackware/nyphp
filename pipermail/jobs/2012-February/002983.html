interfacing with both iOS and PHP developers alongside the non-technical 
team.

Application Support:

* Responsible for learning CMS inside and out.
* Be able to troubleshoot issues sent over from QA, determine whether

staff who are often under pressure and tight deadlines.
* Train staff in CMS use as needed.

Development:
