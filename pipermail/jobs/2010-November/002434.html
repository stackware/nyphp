<PRE>Greetings folks!

We're looking for a fantastic  server engineer to create awesome backends for current and upcoming games! While the bulk of the requirements are in the server world, I'm hoping that we can find a candidate with enough frontend chops to whip up simple admin tools. 

Our offices are located in uber-hip DUMBO, Brooklyn, near the A/C/F/2/3 lines. We've got a great view, a dog, a cat, a kitchen full of goodies, Rock Band, and more. Oh, also some great benefits and other enticements. And we play a lot of Street Fighter.  

Please get in touch directly, <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">justin at freeverse.com.</A>

Very proficient with package management systems including APT, Ports, Yum and RPM, and be able to compile from source.
Deep understanding of how to scale realtime data access to millions of users - load balancing, reverse proxies, failover, and so forth.
Experience with the following:
- Config management systems, such as Chef.
- Alternate web servers, such as NGINX, Lighttpd and Cherokee.
- Monitoring packages, such as Monit and Nagios. 
- Key value stores, such as Redis and MongoDB.
