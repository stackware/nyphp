Are there actually (good) developers who take companies up on offers 
like this? I don't know any, but maybe they're out there somewhere.

If a company is not profitable enough to pay a developer, how is its 
equity worth anything?

A good essay on working for free:

And good questions to ask any company that asks you to work for equity:

Excellent links, Brian.   I personally, have never worked under this kind of 
arrangement.  Possibly it will be more common with the economy in the state 
that it is.  There are different kind of equity arrangements.  Ten thousand 
shares of stock for "when the company goes public" has got a far less chance 
of paying off than a partnership (a share in company income and direction).

    I wouldn't get involved in an equity relationship of any kind unless 
I knew the people involved and believed in the business.  For instance,  
a friend of mine was having trouble getting a bank loan to start a 
business -- I suggested to him that he try equity financing.  I chipped 
in a little money and so did about ten of his friends.  Now the business 
is doing well and has expanded into a new location.

    I got burned once by somebody who offered me 50% of payment in 
equity for a company that he later sold.  In that case,  the business 
was an international affair that was based in the Virgin Islands and 
doing business in Latin America.  I suppose I could have recovered $50k 
or so with a lot of trouble,   but I already moved on and didn't need 
the hassle.  The "offshore" business was a source of entertainment for 
me:  the owner would sign me on as a contact person and I'd get phone 
calls from people who wondered if our business was a scam.

Brian,

An Equity Stake in the company?

What?  No lunch?  No carfare?

Basically, I would become a temporary creditor IF they don't fold.

I can eat a steak, I can't eat a Stake.

I am very sorry-I should have specified, WORDPRESS blog.

 

Thank you.

 

We have a client that needs help with their high-traffic blog. They need
basic training in addition to help with formatting and probably
installing some add-on components. They might need some custom
development as well. 

 

This is a good client. We have managed their IT for 8 years, and they
have always paid promptly the full value of our services. 

 

Please reply to m.galemmo at dcsny.com with a brief bio and any other
useful information, so that I may introduce you to them.
