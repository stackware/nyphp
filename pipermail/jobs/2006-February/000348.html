PHP/MySQL Software Engineer
Duration: Contract on-site, 40 hours/week
Location: New York City (Manhattan)

About Us:

What are you passionate about? At Affinitive (www.beaffinitive.com), we are
more than just marketers and technologists. We are artists. We are parents.
We are athletes. We are pet owners. We are musicians. We are students,
alumni, gamers, fans, investors, and customers.

Since 2002, we have been a leading provider of technology and marketing
solutions which allow companies to &quot;democratize&quot; their brands and cultivate
long-lasting loyalty and awareness with consumers. Our solutions strive to
raise the bar for the nascent marketing discipline of Word of Mouth (WOM)
marketing. The core values of community and social networking, research,
viral and buzz, education, loyalty and CRM have set the foundation for
solutions which have become an industry leader in numerous sectors such as
consumer goods, mobile/wireless, lifestyle brands, film, TV, music, and
video games.

Description:

Affinitive is seeking a skilled PHP/MySQL Software Engineer to join our

specs.
* Work with design staff to ensure a high level of usability.
* Read user requirement documents and assist in writing system
specifications.
* Perform ongoing support and some system administration.
* Meet aggressive deadlines and handle multiple tasks.

Qualifications:

* BS in Computer Science (or related) field.
* Expertise (2+ years) of object-oriented application development experience
using LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP).
* Expertise (2+ years) in database schema design, programming, and
performance tuning, specifically using MySQL.
* Experience (2+ years) with XHTML, XML/RSS, JavaScript, CSS, Smarty, and
CVS for version control.
* AJAX experience is a big plus.
* Great taste in music is a HUGE plus :)
* Ability to think creatively and solve problems.
* Excellent oral and written communication skills.
* Be a hard worker, have attention to detail, and be fun to work with!
