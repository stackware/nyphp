Hi,
I am looking for someone who can come in and help us out on the development
front.  Elephant Ventures is small group of marketing & technology
consultants based in NYC.  All of our employees are on a 1099 basis
(contractors), but we are all working to create something greater and act as
a team.  We currently have an opening for the next 2-3 months for a PHP
developer and solution architect.  The job will include day to day
programming in PHP, as well as working with various other technologies to
solve client problems as they arise.  The ideal candidate has an engineering
background and is fluent in PHP development.

You might also be asked to work with other technologies such as:
Web Services
.NET
ECMA/Javascript
Salesforce.com
Miva Merchant
Coldfusion
DNS
Sendmail

Familiarity with Internet Marketing in general is a plus:
-Search Engine Pay per Click Marketing
-Email Marketing
-Search Engine Optimization
-Online Media Buying and Tracking

In general we need someone who can help us provide solutions to our clients
no matter what the technology required.  There is a strong focus in our
solutions around PHP and MYSQL, but you will need to fear no technology and
be able to work on 'unconstrained' problems by assembling a solution
framework and then testing and revising until you find the right solution.
A minimum of 2 years of consulting experience is necessary.

Please send a resume and salary requirements and we'll be in touch if we
think you are a fit.
Please don't take it personally if you don't hear back from us, we are
swamped.

Thanks,

Art

Hi,

I'm a small adult video on demand company in need of a programmer to take over the reins of the person who developed the site.  I'm almost done with this current programmer and because of distance and other issues, I would like to have a programmer more close by here in New York or at the least, the tri-state area.

Please email me back if you have time (preferably 4hrs per day) to take on a project.

Thanks for your time,

James Platteborze
