Hello,

My name is Hans and I'm a co-founder of GiftFlow, a non-profit start-up
based in New Haven, CT.

GiftFlow is a community where you post what you need and what you can give
away. The site connects you with others nearby and users write each other
reviews after each gift. GiftFlow connects community organizations,
businesses, governments and neighbors into a giant network of reciprocity,
where they can share resources, meet each others' needs and coordinate their
efforts to build a better world. GiftFlow is here so that people can work
cooperatively without the need for money
I previously emailed this list looking for volunteers. Now after a
successful fund raising effort, GiftFlow is looking to hire a part-time PHP
programmer to
assist with back-end development. The position will be supervised by our
lead developer. We prefer someone within the NYC metro area.

We are very close to launching our beta and need an extra hand for rolling
out more features and supporting expansion of our user base. We are looking
for an experienced programmer who can start in January and contribute
anywhere from 5-20 hours a week.

Please respond and we can set up an interview,

Thanks
Hans

Message-ID: <AANLkTinEvywhspoM7WLj+uz+X5gb4KUi9u7e8AOx8ziw@mail.gmail.com>

Etsy is a large website, and has problems similar to most in its class. You
will learn to work at huge scales.

Our code is written in: everything. Just kidding. It's written in: PHP,
Python, Ruby, Scala, Javascript, Clojure, C, Java, and Matlab. Yes, Matlab.
So as you can see we need people who, ideally, already know everything. Or
failing that, are capable of learning anything.

Comparing Etsy to other places:
  * Automated testing is more important to us.
  * Job titles and "N years of experience" are less important to us.
  * Engineers are expected to be able to manage themselves to a greater
extent.
  * You will learn more about web operations.

Dogs are part of the team, and are expected to commit code.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Architect, Sr Dev, Front End Dev,
 etc. (multiple roles) at dynamic young media company
Message-ID: <AANLkTimJEMLXAFsMhc-VPEHeVVEvagvDjMgNfuW_fGUN@mail.gmail.com>

Join one of the top online travel media companies and lead us forth
into new products and technologies!  We're looking for PHP ninjas /
rock stars / pirates / gurus / <insert term-du-jour here> to help lead
our agile team. ?We have a number of new products and services rolling
out in 2011 and want you to help us lead them.

(Like non-web platforms? While we're primarily web we're launching on
the ipad and will be doing other mobile apps as well.)

We have multiple roles open including Architect, Tech Lead, Sr
Developer, Front End Developer, and more.  The follow is a generic
description, specific responsibility and requirements will vary by
particular role (but you already know the difference in jobs
descriptions between say an architect and a front end developer
anyway).


Responsibilities
* Lead design and development of different product lines
* Develop and maintain (well tested, well documented) code
* Lead and mentor more junior developers
* Keep on top of new technologies and help discover technology based
business opportunities on the web, phones, ipad, and other platforms


Requirements:
* Significant experience coding PHP / LAMP
* Strong communication skills
* Comfort with *nix environments
* Experience with MySQL
* Experience mentoring
* Fun attitude, well liked by co-workers (don't underestimate how is
important this one is!)

Nice to haves...
* Good leadership abilities a plus
* Strong MySQL skills a big plus
* CakePHP and other framework experience a plus
* Experience with other languages (RoR, Java, Python) a plus
* Experience with scrum or other agile methodologies a plus
* Well traveled passport is a big plus


About the company:
We are a small, profitable travel media company located in midtown
Manhattan. ?We have all the upside of a startup (casual environment,
agile methodology, rapid launching of new web and mobile products)
combined with the advantages of an established company (profitable,
good brand name, an existing user base to quickly adopt new products).

Every single person in engineering is expected to be a leader. ?If you
want to be told what to do and code quietly in the corner, we're not
the place for you. ?Rather we want engineers who say "I've got an
idea..." and will see that idea from thought through roll-out.
Engineers are expected to keep abreast of new technologies and use
them to develop new products.

Our industry is travel and our employees travel the world, so if you
like traveling you'll enjoy the perks of being an insider.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Hybrid Role: Sys Admin / MySQL DBA / PHP Dev
Message-ID: <AANLkTinihE7_rbR9zX5+ybsjVRTUz7JqUAJ-S=R11Qca@mail.gmail.com>

This is a hybrid role and so offers a lot of opportunity for career
growth along multiple paths.  Below are the three components of the
roles--the weighting between them is flexible.  This job is ideal who
a programmer who likes system work or a sys admin looking to shift
more towards programming.  It absolutely offers a lot of variety.



Job Description:

Sys Admin
We run managed servers (CentOS) but there are overall system
architecture and maintenance issues.  We send millions of emails a
month to our customers (opt-in, nothing sketchy here) and run some
large email systems.  There are also a number of tools we either use
in-house or with whom we integrate (from nagios and continuous
integration servers to 24/7's OAS).

MySQL DBA
We have some sizable, replicated MySQL servers (InnoDB).  We need at
least three 9's uptime and ideally four.  You should understand
installation, monitoring, performance turning, replication, and backup
and recovery schemes.

Coder
Our systems are stable and a good admin like yourself can keep things
humming with minimal effort.  The above two roles will probably take
up 40-60% of the time. We do a lot of PHP coding and would like
someone who can contribute to the code base as an active developer on
the team. We also use a number of scripts to keep everything wired
together which you would likely own.



Requirements
* Significant experience with *nix system administration (ideally
CentOS or similar)
* Significant experience with large, replicated MySQL databases
needing 24/7 uptime
* Experience with large volume email servers and email list management
* Unix shell scripting experience
* Experience with standard web hardware--firewalls, load balances, etc.
* Experience with PHP
* Strong communication skills
* Fun attitude, well liked by co-workers (don't underestimate how is
important this one is!)

Nice to haves...
* Experience with scrum or other agile methodologies a plus
* Well traveled passport is a big plus
