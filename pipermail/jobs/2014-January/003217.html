<PRE>Hello,

Domani Studios is looking for a full-time or freelance Senior Developer,
with a focus on ecommerce and Magento, to join our A-team of producers,
designers, and developers in our New York office.

We have built a collaborative and open studio environment over the past 10
years and need your help to continue delivering groundbreaking work for our
clients. In addition to producing high quality code, we are looking for
somebody that can serve as a technical lead on larger projects.

A Senior Developer at Domani Studios is passionate about technology and
highly motivated to see projects to completion in a timely, accurate and
efficient manner. We are looking for a great team player that can inspire
and guide other developers in the group. We are particularly interested in
individuals possessing a quality oriented attitude, with attention to
detail and capable to debug other people's code as well as their own. If
you like being challenged and learning new stuff every day, we want to hear
from you.

The focus for this Senior Developer is to play a critical role in the build
of several enterprise ecommerce sites on the Magento platform. You should
be able to think big picture and approach projects holistically while
taking and giving direction to other team members. Familiarity with
multi-tiered enterprise-level application development is also desired.
Ideally, you're familiar with large scale systems integration, are
comfortable with data feeds and custom module development/integration, and
are happy to dive into documentation when faced with new technologies.

*Responsibilities:*

   - Provide feedback on creative concepts, as it relates to technical
   feasibility
   - Provide solutions in line with approved design specifications
   - Develop prototypes to help with selection of solution options
   - Provide estimates for development work to include analysis,
   programming and testing
   - Participate in internal and client production reviews
   - Provide appropriate feedback on the status of project work or problem
   resolution
   - Analyze software problems and provide solutions to those problems
   - Open and continuous communications with project managers and other
   members of team with regard to workload and project challenges
   - Work with external partners for integration points as required
   - High-level interaction with clients

*Requirements:*

   - Expert, demonstrated knowledge of Magento Enterprise with large,
   multisite installations
   - Magento systems administration and configuration, customization, and
   module extension
   - Expert knowledge of  objected-oriented PHP and MySQL in a LAMP
   environment
   - Experience building data-driven web applications and writing technical
   specifications
   - Exposure to front and back end systems integration, including inbound
   and outbound data feeds, data transformation, and creating custom
   components for frameworks, content management systems, or ecommerce
   applications
   - Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, and XML
   - Experience working with proprietary client-side scripting languages,
   markup, and tag libraries
   - Experience with Zend, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, WordPress, Drupal, and
   Ruby on Rails
   - Unix/Linux administration
   - Experience with version control systems (SVN/Git)

*Bonus points:*

   - Magento certification
   - Mobile web development experience
   - Active participation in the developer community
   - Previous interactive agency experience
