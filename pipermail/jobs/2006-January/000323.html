<PRE>Hi there,
Some of you know me from my nyphp speaking on PHPGTK desktop applets,
I switched jobs a while back and need to find a new developer to join
the team.

I am senior developer for an online real estate company located in
Midtown and we need a developer.
---------------------------
Our setup, on the way out:
- Currently we use Oracle on Sun, Postgres and Debian with PHP and
some nasty perl.. It is legacy in ways which baffle the mind, and is
non-templated... but there is good news.

Our *NEW* setup.
- I have six brand spankin new HP servers (DL380's, DL360's and
DL140's). Gentoo linux for internal network and OpenBSD with pf for
the frontend, and  we are moving to MySQL 5, PHP5 and Apache2 (not
threaded).. We will still keep our Postgres sites running, but the
work there is minimal (still be helpful to know Postgres a little)..
Many of the old perl scripts will be rewritten in PHP and Python and
we have put together a very speedy templating system.
---------------------------
What we need from a developer.
- Someone who is comfortable working in a varied environment, feels
they can learn fast and adapt to a fast paced workplace with many
different platforms and databases.

- Experience: we need someone who has been around the block and knows
and preferably uses linux systems. We are not interested in
certifications, we don't support/use windows 'anything' and our
developers use linux as desktop machines.  You will preferably need to
know mysql and php inside-out and have a few years experience or some
nice projects under your belt.

- Someone who can multi-task multiple projects as we have so much
going on that moving to this new hardware is going slow, we need
someone to help take over some development so we can get the time to
convert hundreds of queries from oracle to mysql and handle all issues
related to moving from one platform to another.


We are a pretty small team, we have a lot of work ahead of us and
business is growing fast. The atmosphere here is actually pretty
mellow most of the time, though we do have a large workload.

We pay competitive for experience.

If you feel you are a good match and can help us rip out some killer
code and want a chance to help re-engineer a system from the ground up
using the latest and greatest then.. Please email a note at
<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">joeldg at gmail.com</A> and attach a plaintext or pdf resume, I do have
openoffice installed, so I can handle msword docs if you happen to be
stuck in windows for some reason.

Cheers
-Joel De Gan
