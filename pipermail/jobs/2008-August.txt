Message-ID: <636345.25145.qm@web32701.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

A successful and cutting edge media company is seeking J2EE developers for an array of online magazines. 

The biggest need is in the Content Management group, where experience with Teamsite would be a big plus. This group builds applications that support all aspects of bringing dynamic content to all our online sites. 

There are other J2EE roles to work on the server side of the online sites. The technology is cutting edge. A typical skill set is J2EE, Spring, Hiberate, ad delivery technology, CMS. Building new features that can handle millions of users. 

The working environment is cutting edge and what you would expect of a magazine. Not your typical boring computer cubes by any means. The design and technical teams are top notch, you will be working with smart people. I know, I used to be a Java consultant there myself.  

Please send your resumes if interested. 

Gary

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

Be sure to request some source before you work with him.

It's not only unethical to publicly disparage an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to legal action.

Have you ever made an error while performing your job duties?

Even a former employer would not give out this type of information.  Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be valid?  

This is not the same as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business practice.

There's been a firestorm of public criticism over "el cheapo Indian 
purveyors of crappy half a**ed code" both in general and specifically 
against various individuals, and for good reason.  Warning someone 
against this sort of thing might even be considered a public service in 
some cases.

So I think there might be a huge difference, legally, between doing 
that, and actual disparagment of anyone's competence.  

Besides...it's impossibly expensive for them to sue anyone in America 
for disparagement and loss of income -- and impossible also for us to 
sue them for delivery of crappy code, because they're in India.

Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending 
up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their 
work, which may or may not be valid?

I'm sorry Donna, but I disagree.

It's perfectly fine to express a view about someone's work.

Of course we make errors in our code, everybody does.  But you can't evaluate experience without examining ones work.

And employers DO give out this information.  Especially if an individual was let go because of inability.

Finally, I'm having a problem imagining rows of unemployed PHP coders down and out on skid-row in cardboard boxes, homeless, because their work was criticized.

Bye,

Rob

  It's not only unethical to publicly disparage an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to legal action.

  Have you ever made an error while performing your job duties?

  Even a former employer would not give out this type of information.  Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be valid?  

  This is not the same as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business practice.

Hello,

No, I can't. If the client feels they want to speak up, so be it. I 
believe they found you on this list.

All he did was to provide transparency, now we are discussing the  
issues. Kristina gave very valid points about the 'delivery of crappy  
code' and not being able to take action because they are in another  
country.

Another point is that this why we have standards of development  
practices, these standards shouldn't be compromised they can bend a  
bit but not break. Sundar needs to seek them out and adhere to them.

I know it may seem harsh but it may help Sundar down the line in his  
growth.  As well as protect a small struggling company, thinking they  
are saving money but  falling into a trap.

Ben did a good thing.

I disagree. This wasn't a former employer complaining about a 
consultant's work, this was another consultant, a competitor if you 
will, stating as fact something that no one can possibly double-check. I 
think it's unfair, and am surprised that, on a list dedicated to helping 
consultants find jobs, you folks would not be more concerned about it. I 
think this is the first time I have seen someone in a public forum 
accuse someone of something and not be called to provide proof of their 
claims. Very puzzling.

No one knows what the job requirements were, what the client's 
expectations were, or what the budget was. Did the client provide enough 
time and budget to have the job done right, or did they just say, "Get 
it done for next to nothing," and then when they realized the 
short-sidedness of their approach, hire Ben to clean up the mess rather 
than go back to the developer they low-balled and admit that they didn't 
give him enough time and $$ to do the job correctly. We don't know. Ben 
won't even tell the list who the client was or produce evidence of the 
inferior work. So to my mind, this whole thread is quite unfair to the 
developer who originally posted his availability and should be dropped.

Finally, as you read this, please keep in mind that we are a company 
that  employs people on this list, that's why I subscribe. I have 
employed developers here in the US and in six other countries. I find 
*no* geo-political differences in coding skills. We evaluate developers 
based on samples, client references and their ability to follow 
directions. I have had more than a few developers who are so focused on 
developing "great code" that they completely ignore the project specs, 
budget and time-lines. Those people don't last long, but people who 
follow directions do.

Again, without knowing the original assignment that Sundar was given and 
what went on between he and the client at that time, facts which I doubt 
even Ben knows, we really can't draw any useful conclusions nor should 
we try.

Just my $.02.

That's something that should have been done privately and directly to the person involved.

How do you know Ben's criticism is accurate?  How do you know Sundar hasn't learned to write better code since that time?

This was not the appropriate place for his criticism.

All he did was to provide transparency, now we are discussing the issues. Kristina gave very valid points about the 'delivery of crappy code' and not being able to take action because they are in another country.  

Another point is that this why we have standards of development practices, these standards shouldn't be compromised they can bend a bit but not break. Sundar needs to seek them out and adhere to them.

I know it may seem harsh but it may help Sundar down the line in his growth.  As well as protect a small struggling company, thinking they are saving money but  falling into a trap.

Ben did a good thing.

It's not only unethical to publicly disparage an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to legal action.

Have you ever made an error while performing your job duties?

Even a former employer would not give out this type of information.  Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be valid?  

This is not the same as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business practice.

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or
 smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

Be sure to request some source before you work with him.

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or
 smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

  I disagree. This wasn't a former employer complaining about a consultant's work, this was another consultant, a competitor if you will, stating as fact something that no one can possibly double-check. I think it's unfair, and am surprised that, on a list dedicated to helping consultants find jobs, you folks would not be more concerned about it. I think this is the first time I have seen someone in a public forum accuse someone of something and not be called to provide proof of their claims. Very puzzling.

  No one knows what the job requirements were, what the client's expectations were, or what the budget was. Did the client provide enough time and budget to have the job done right, or did they just say, "Get it done for next to nothing," and then when they realized the short-sidedness of their approach, hire Ben to clean up the mess rather than go back to the developer they low-balled and admit that they didn't give him enough time and $$ to do the job correctly. We don't know. Ben won't even tell the list who the client was or produce evidence of the inferior work. So to my mind, this whole thread is quite unfair to the developer who originally posted his availability and should be dropped.

  Finally, as you read this, please keep in mind that we are a company that  employs people on this list, that's why I subscribe. I have employed developers here in the US and in six other countries. I find *no* geo-political differences in coding skills. We evaluate developers based on samples, client references and their ability to follow directions. I have had more than a few developers who are so focused on developing "great code" that they completely ignore the project specs, budget and time-lines. Those people don't last long, but people who follow directions do.

  Again, without knowing the original assignment that Sundar was given and what went on between he and the client at that time, facts which I doubt even Ben knows, we really can't draw any useful conclusions nor should we try.

  Just my $.02.

        It's not only unethical to publicly disparage an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to legal action.

        Have you ever made an error while performing your job duties?

        Even a former employer would not give out this type of information.  Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be valid?  

        This is not the same as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business practice.

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or
 smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

Be sure to request some source before you work with him.

Yeah, that's the concern I have about something like this.  I've read 
Ben's posts for a while so I have no reason to doubt the criticism but, 
truth is, I also have no reason to believe there might not be a personal 
grudge being vented.  I'm not suggesting that's what's happening here, 
just that it bothers me that we're all potentially vulnerable to having 
capricious charges lobbed against us in a public forum.

Just last week, on another forum, I read someone brutalize a masonry 
contractor I've used several times and know to be one of the best in the 
city.  After speaking with him, the issue was a dispute over an 
expensive change-work order which the client expected the contractor to 
eat after the contracts had been signed and the quote locked in.

Message-ID: <1218303041.19517@coral.he.net>

There are some on this list who've previously said that "the market" 
will take care of situations where people want to pay low wages to 
programmers.  One of the ways that "the market" might do this, 
theoretically, is to make sure that people find out the hard way, when 
they hire cheap programmers, that it takes a lot of experience and 
dedication to be good at this, and a good programmer expects (and 
needs) remuneration of a more-than-minimum-wage sort (and stands behind 
their work -- if something needs to be fixed, fixes it).

With globalization and wage pressures increasing, these issues aren't 
going away.  But from a personal standpoint, I'm at a stage in my 
career where I want to move from competence to excellence.  Dealing 
with situations where I'm being not being paid a fair fee for my work, 
or situations where clients are being unfair or unreasonable, does not 
put me in the correct mental state to move towards excellence.  Too 
many of us are caught in a tug of war between our own desire to write 
good, solid code and the stark reality of the amount of code we need to 
generate to pay the bills...the greater the amount of that code is, the 
greater likelihood that some of it just isn't going to be as good as it 
could have been.

I don't mean to say that I agree specifically with posting comments of 
a critical nature on a public board.  I am not qualified to say whether 
it's right or wrong to do so here.  Just posting some thoughts.

This is cruel and inappropriate.  It's more about killing off your competition to build yourself up than it is about providing helpful information.  Barbaric is another word that comes to mind.

I don't think we are trying to kill off the competition just raise the  
bar of professionalism.

Ben in his post didn't say outright, Sundar was a bad programmer or  
someone you shouldn't work with. He gave a description of Sundar's  
work and recommended that you request a work sample.  There might be  
people who don't care about or know what  OOP, Database encapsulation  
or MVC is, for those people Sundar is some you might want to with.

Another issue this brings up is,  PHP and web developers are looked  
down on as Hacks. I work for a Financial Services Technology Company  
and work with Java, C and C++ developers everyday. They don't think  
very much of PHP developers. But when they see me use OOP,  Database  
Encapsulation, MVC  etc... They are very shocked and surprised.  I  
have been asked by a C++ developer if PHP has arrays.  LOL

This negative image of PHP and Web Developers is based on their past  
experience, working with developers who work the same way Sundar  
does.  We all have seen people who code like this. Doesn't mean Sundar  
is a bad person or never work with the guy. He just has to grow.

Sundar will be fine and will be a better developer out of this, I know  
it isn't easy. It's not fun but he will improve out of this.

Hi All,
?
Thanks for all the criticism to my post & the reply sent by Ben.
?
Actually I never know who this guys Ben is , I have never worked with him before & ofcourse he is not my client too.
?
I have been in this freelancing profession for abt 3+ yrs & never got such criticism from my clients , though I had troubles / faults in the project that I work with my clients , they use to tell me the changes & I do make sure to deliver those changes as per the client's requests.
?
I never leave my clients in trouble with frustration , even though if I do some mistakes I do admit to my clients & they give me a chance to work on it & prove it & I have done so.
?
You all can have a look at my online portfolio at http://www.sundarrajan.com , besides I have also been member in various freelancing forums & have good client reference , reputation.
?
If you all wish to help a fellow programmer like me , just request Ben to send us what project I worked that had the issues as he said. To the best of my knowledge I don't think there shud be such projects , but if there were some issues the client would have got resolved it with me , they would'nt speak bad abt me to a third party code auditor like Ben (because all the clients I have worked were very genuine , pleasant & helpfull in nature).
?
Pls guys never think bad & have a negative impression abt me, due to Ben's posting , though I'm not located in US , I do work with clients based at US / UK etc,..
?
510.455.4387 this is my US skypein number , you can call me in this number if you have issues with this post.
?
I wonder why Ben has posted such critics abt my thread publicly on this forum.
?
Anyway lets wait for a good solution.

I disagree. This wasn't a former employer complaining about a consultant's work, this was another consultant, a competitor if you will, stating as fact something that no one can possibly double-check. I think it's unfair, and am surprised that, on a list dedicated to helping consultants find jobs, you folks would not be more concerned about it. I think this is the first time I have seen someone in a public forum accuse someone of something and not be called to provide proof of their claims. Very puzzling.

No one knows what the job requirements were, what the client's expectations were, or what the budget was. Did the client provide enough time and budget to have the job done right, or did they just say, "Get it done for next to nothing," and then when they realized the short-sidedness of their approach, hire Ben to clean up the mess rather than go back to the developer they low-balled and admit that they didn't give him enough time and $$ to do the job correctly. We don't know. Ben won't even tell the list who the client was or produce evidence of the inferior work. So to my mind, this whole thread is quite unfair to the developer who originally posted his availability and should be dropped.

Finally, as you read this, please keep in mind that we are a company that? employs people on this list, that's why I subscribe. I have employed developers here in the US and in six other countries. I find *no* geo-political differences in coding skills. We evaluate developers based on samples, client references and their ability to follow directions. I have had more than a few developers who are so focused on developing "great code" that they completely ignore the project specs, budget and time-lines. Those people don't last long, but people who follow directions do.

Again, without knowing the original assignment that Sundar was given and what went on between he and the client at that time, facts which I doubt even Ben knows, we really can't draw any useful conclusions nor should we try.

Just my $.02.

It's not only unethical to publicly disparage an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to legal action.

Have you ever made an error while performing your job duties?

Even a former employer would not give out this type of information.? Do you want to be responsible for someone not getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be valid???

This is not the same as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business practice.

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or
 smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

Be sure to request some source before you work with him.

- Ben

Actually it seems Ben did it wrong.

None here born with all knowledge, and surely they improved their
skills by working hard to improve themselves while reading,
researching and experimenting.
So, none here has enough words to point a finger on someone else's
face, talk about skills, etc.

You pay for your code and if you want to pay less, your code will be
less secure, organized, implemented.
That's what differ senior, junior, etc and also good and bad programmers.
I'll never put my money into a 15yrs. old boy that tells me that knows
PHP, since I know I have a great chance to have holes in my code.

Short version: The amount of money you pay is the code art equivalent you have.

I'm just not sure that's a lesson that can be learned by singling out 
one programmer for critical review.  Anyone who's been in this business 
for a few years has heard the nightmare outsourcing stories and knows 
that the market for software talent works pretty much the same as it 
does buying a TV or a hamburger: caveat emptor.  If they choose to 
ignore it, well, that's who lottery tickets are made for.

Ben,

Your .02$ may backfire on you.  You may have an obligation to your  
client to report your opinion but you have an obligation not to report  
it to the world at large.  I believe it was a bad judgement on your  
part and if enough people feel likewise, it may be you who loses work  
over it.

Just my .02$.

Hi,
I just wanted to point out that price does not directly correlate to
quality.  Although more experienced programmers who (presumably) produce
better code will often charge more, this is not always the case and
certainly does not translate to the overseas market.  I am sure there are
many excellent and qualified foreign programmers who are able to charge less
than American programmers due to the differences in cost of life.  That is
the usually a reason for outsourcing overseas.  Just because someone is
cheap(er) does not necessarily imply inexperience or poor skills.

Ben
Your email is out of order and a weak attempt to put someone's work down while making yourself feel better.  Ohhhh... Ben you are such a good programmer that you exposed  errors in Sundar's  code.  You are so cool.  I might name my next child after you, but he would get beat up in the school yard with a name such as  loser or geek.  
If you had an issue with Sundar you should of approched him directly instead of in public.  Wow..what a tough cool guy you are... God forbid if we were talking about C++ then you would have really killed Sundar's rep.  Good thing we are only talking about mickey mouse code.  
And the award goes to Ben, our cool role model player  programmer.  Now kiss yourself in the mirror then go bore someone else with your thoughts.

Hello,

No, I can't. If the client feels they want to speak up, so be it. I 
believe they found you on this list.

Hello All,

Many interesting points; Been trying to keep up w/them on the mobile.

I did not intend to create an 'event' on the forum - just wanted to 
provide my opinion as observed.

Someone noted that I did not go about it the correct way - I'll take 
that to heart.

As far as everything else, I love PHP. I love the PHP community. Those 
that are doing it a service, I commend.

Those that are doing it a disservice, I have been vocal about.

Either way, its my opinion. Again, I'm not trying to create problems, 
though it appears I have.
Next time, I will probably handle the situation a bit differently - or 
just say nothing at all (which is bs to me).

- Ben

Thanks to all the private email providing feedback.

  This is cruel and inappropriate.  It's more about killing off your competition to build yourself up than it is about providing helpful information.  Barbaric is another word that comes to mind.

    I disagree. This wasn't a former employer complaining about a consultant's work, this was another consultant, a competitor if you will, stating as fact something that no one can possibly double-check. I think it's unfair, and am surprised that, on a list dedicated to helping consultants find jobs, you folks would not be more concerned about it. I think this is the first time I have seen someone in a public forum accuse someone of something and not be called to provide proof of their claims. Very puzzling.

    No one knows what the job requirements were, what the client's expectations were, or what the budget was. Did the client provide enough time and budget to have the job done right, or did they just say, "Get it done for next to nothing," and then when they realized the short-sidedness of their approach, hire Ben to clean up the mess rather than go back to the developer they low-balled and admit that they didn't give him enough time and $$ to do the job correctly. We don't know. Ben won't even tell the list who the client was or produce evidence of the inferior work. So to my mind, this whole thread is quite unfair to the developer who originally posted his availability and should be dropped.

    Finally, as you read this, please keep in mind that we are a company that  employs people on this list, that's why I subscribe. I have employed developers here in the US and in six other countries. I find *no* geo-political differences in coding skills. We evaluate developers based on samples, client references and their ability to follow directions. I have had more than a few developers who are so focused on developing "great code" that they completely ignore the project specs, budget and time-lines. Those people don't last long, but people who follow directions do.

    Again, without knowing the original assignment that Sundar was given and what went on between he and the client at that time, facts which I doubt even Ben knows, we really can't draw any useful conclusions nor should we try.

    Just my $.02.

      Another point is that this why we have standards of development practices, these standards shouldn't be compromised they can bend a bit but not break. Sundar needs to seek them out and adhere to them.


      I know it may seem harsh but it may help Sundar down the line in his growth.  As well as protect a small struggling company, thinking they are saving money but  falling into a trap.

It's not only unethical to publicly disparage  an individual's ability to perform a job, you could be subject to  legal action.

Have you ever made an error while performing your  job duties?

Even a former employer would not give out this type  of information.  Do you want to be responsible for someone not  getting work, and ending up homeless on the street, because of your  personal opinion about their work, which may or may not be  valid?  

This is not the same  as publicly criticizing a particular product, or a company's business  practice.

Hey,

I audited a site this guy built - it was full of holes - SQL injection, 
XSS, default passwords on CMS admin accounts, etc.

Also, the code was PHP4 w/HTML sprinkled all over it, cut and paste, no 
functions. No layouts, templates or
 smarty.
Basically, impossible and very time consuming to make updates.

Be sure to request some source before you work with him.

This has all been an interesting discussion, i think Ben has a lot of  
cheers because we have all in some way or another had to feel the pain  
of cleaning up someone else's code mess, be it foreign-built or  
otherwise.  I think the point that it wasn't the place do so might  
have some merit, but one point i haven't heard mentioned is whether or  
not the NY PHP board is really the place for Sundar or any other non- 
NY php developer to post about his services and expect non-reproachful  
responses when he does so.

What are the NY PHP list moderator's positions on that?

and it's also true that, albeit painful, cleanup work can easily account
for half of the new business development in any freelancer's career... i
for one have been dealing with four-year+ old code for one company for
which i currently consult (and have been for over a year) and the former
developer did such a poor job that the expectations are rather low and the
client is utterly grateful for any and all improvements i suggest and
implement... it's not as interesting as new development which uses your
own sense of best-practice, but it sure can be lucrative!

As an employer, i appreciate availability posts and *always* check the person out, whether we need help at the moment or not.

I hope that freelancers will continue to post their availability on this list. That's why I am concerned about anything that might inhibit someone from posting for fear of being publicly criticized.

It's hard to find good people! Let them post and I will make my own decisions.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] Freelance Remote PHP/MySQL gig with about 5+
	yrsofexp & good client references
In-Reply-To: <200808100048.m7A0m5Y4028931@boston-2.grand-central.net>

Granted there are some people who want help, no matter where that help  
is coming from - they are fine looking into a telecommuting  
contractor.  My question is just if this list is the place for it, or  
if there is another list specifically for that type of posting.  Its  
like going to ebay (does anyone even shop on ebay anymore?) to shop  
for a computer, going to the 'computers' category, and seeing a bunch  
of computer parts.  Maybe someone out there clicked the computers  
category and also happened to be looking for a video card and is glad  
to see it, but its still an abuse of the system and makes the overall  
categorization aspect of ebay less valuable.

I'm not saying that non NY developers don't have a place here, i'm  
pretty new to the board, and am in no position to say whether or not  
they do or not, i'm just wondering if someone else here who has been  
around a while longer does know what the official (or emergent)  
position is.

Just curious!

Hello All,

/This is cruel and inappropriate.  It's more about killing off your 
competition to build yourself up than it is about providing helpful 
information.  Barbaric is another word that comes to mind./

To be clear I'm not a freelancer. I was in the past for many years, but 
I now have an excellent day job and I only do *research* outside of work.
(For those like are interested in Singularity, Evolutionary Robotics and 
Genetic Programming, drop me a line - I just finished presenting at HOPE 
@ Hotel Penn a few weekends ago on those very subjects)

I learned something today and I'm glad for the praise and criticisms.

Enjoy the weekend.

- Ben

All,

At the end of the day, it's about what the market will bear.  We feel that
people should be able to post their availability, and at the same time
critique each other in a professional manner.  If you're not good at
handling criticism, or cannot criticize constructively, then I'd recommend
you not post.

While there have been some unnecessary jab posts in this thread, overall
this is the type of discussion that makes a jobs mailing list not just a
repository of resumes and position listings (those sites already exist).
This level of discussion provides:

-- those seeking skill to see how someone can handle themselves and what's
available in today's market

-- those with skill to see what and what/not to do from others (their
competition)

-- those on both sides, to get a feel for the current market's strong areas,
risks, etc.


There are a number of adages that perhaps illustrate the democratic nature
of free discussion (substitute "enemy" with "competition" where you feel
necessary):

Know thy enemy
What goes around comes around
Once bitten, twice shy
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
Fool me once, shame on you
     Fool me twice, shame on me
Let's keep it clean and come out fighting


Or, in the words from the FABULOUSLY BORING Mamma Mia movie that I saw last
night with my girlfriend:

The Name of the Game

We are looking for a backhoe operator to dig holes and move dirt from one
location to another. While this job does not directly utilize PHP, by
digging in specific locations deep enough, you have the ability to control
access to thousands if not millions of internet PHP applications. Required
qualifications: sharp spacial cognition, pushing levers forwards and
backwards, J2EE web application development, and the ability to wolf
whistle loudly.

Hi Gary,

I'm interested in the operator position.  I do not have a
backhoe-focused resume on hand, but I have dealt a lot with physical
labor on a daily basis.  My fingers are in great shape from my current
grind, PHP.  Therefore, I do not foresee any issues in lever
operation.  I do not have much experience with J2EE development, but I
am a quick learner.  I'll be straight with you on the wolf whistle.
The best you're going to get out of me a whisper, but I am willing to
substitute with a bark, various duck calls, or gratuitous shouting.  I
look forward to hearing from you soon.

-Kevin

Message-ID: <1218481343.24547@coral.he.net>

Greetings,

Upon due consideration, I've decided that what's best for me right now 
is to transition from a freelance role into a full time PHP role.  

I want to spend my time writing code and building things.  In fact, I 
NEED to be spending my time doing that, or what's the point?  

Instead I'm spending over 60% of my time just in keeping things afloat 
here, sending out RFPs, dealing with interminable phone calls and 
emails and meetings, being an accountant, a therapist and a collection 
agent...

Resume will be sent upon request to any interested parties, and I'd 
welcome any suggestions.  

-Kristina

Hello Darryle,

I'm sorry you might have misread. The job description is seeking
candidates experienced with dirt and backhoes, not dirty ho's.

Oh and if you can't get a grasp of the web interface, just email 
"jobs-unsubscribe at lists.nyphp.org"

I configure all my mailing lists to insert a footer with unsubscribe 
info like

"To unsubscribe from this list, email jobs-unsubscribe at lists.nyphp.org"

People do still post "how do I unsubscribe" emails, but much fewer.

It is also useful to include a
"you are subscribed as xxx at yyy" along with the instructions.
Out of approximately 200,000 subscribers, at least 10 a month will 
forget that they forwarded all the email from address X to address Y - 
resulting in them trying to unsubscribe with their new address and the 
system either saying "ok your unsubscribed" if it's stupid or "I don't 
know who you are" if it is smart.  Either way, the person is stuck on 
the list.

Out of 10 people failing to unsubscribe due to forwarding issues, 1 will 
be someone who inherited a job someone else did who left the company, 
and so had all their email forwarded to the new persons address[often 
not even knowing it] - so its a good idea not to get too cranky at 
people for not realising their subscription is to the wrong address.

_And not all of them can be expected to look through the headers for the 
line
_

To determine that despite this email coming to my private email box, it 
was sent to my public bzcoder throwaway address.

BTW, this especially applies for commercial email as you don't want 
people to start hitting the "this is spam" button in frustration.

IMHO, I much prefer to see overseas people willing to telecommute
posting their availability to nyPHP jobs, regardless of whether they are
competition or not and whether they spark debates over past practices -
than to see Java specific jobs posted to the PHP list.

This reminds me of a thought I had the other day.  Wouldn't it make 
sense to add an "unsubscribe" field to the email spec, which would allow 
spam blockers to start an "auto-unsubscribe" conversation with the 
originating sender before explicitly marking it as spam?  Would also 
allow a default "unsubscribe" button in all email clients.  I hate to 
think of how many legitimate mailing lists have been marked as spam as a 
simplified (and reliable) means to unsubscribe.

I tend to agree, and find it amusing that Gary somehow failed to take the hint.

Yeah, we won't let you leave...

Folks, this is a mailing list.  If you've been able to subscribe, note the email address that you're receiving the mail on and unsubscribe.  If you don't know, look at the email header.

Regardless, this is easily done at:

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs

And a quick note on the list in general...

Lately there's been a lot of traffic.  As I mentioned in my previous post, while we want to avoid flames and list noise as we do on all NYPHP mailing lists, this is after all a mailing list.

This means useful discussion is welcomed and will not be moderated.

If you're here to either post your resume, scalp resumes, or find that "perfect developer" without knowing the market, then you are encouraged to subscribe and unsubscribe as suits your needs.

That said, we are considering developing a moderated list with a web form, time permitting, that will only allow open positions to be posted.  Thoughts, feedback?  Help/moderators?

I've no problems with the way it is now.  I can see why some recruiters 
might not appreciate the potential for negative feedback but the target 
market for the list is after all us and not recruiters.  I appreciate 
seeing the comments so long as they stay on point and don't beat the 
dead and burned beyond all recognition horse.

I agree. There are already a plethora of "job boards" available for 
recruiters and HR departments. I like the down & dirty version of the 
NYPHP mailing list. It also amuses me to see email messages that start 
with, "Hi, I would like you to post this for me..."

Hans,

I would be willing to moderate that list.  Although, that solution seems 
to already exist in the market place and I am not sure we really need it. 

I think there is something unique about how our job list works and it 
feels like a real meritocracy and provides for a open two way channel.  
If we cut off half that, then we become more like a media channel and 
the conversation becomes one sided.  I would like to imagine that our 
complaints (suggestions) about the job listings have improved the 
quality of them.

Maybe I am alone, but I have  found the recent discourse on this list to 
be of more value then the talk list and would like to keep it lively. If 
we give the recruiters a way out, a 'safe harbor' for posting, then we 
opt to exclude ourselves from half the conversation.  Your email the 
other day really outlined why this list is important and worthwhile.

Hans

Hans,


I hope this works.

With a name that rolls off the tongue, "Hans Kaspersetz," it should work.

I agree.  We should in no way modify the functionality of the jobs list. 
It is incredibly helpful the way it is.

Speaking of valuable dialogue here on our jobs discussion list, the 
below job listing prompts me to comment:

Why not just come out and say that you are looking for some 24 year old 
("We are young, successful, and fun") who is willing to work 60 hours a 
week for what did you say, 45K?? ("Salary Range:   45-75 k depending on 
experience").

"INCENTIVES
> Occasional company happy hours"

This means that in addition to working 60 hours a week for slave wages, 
you also want me to spend some of my very valuable free time drinking 
with you and pretending to actually like you??  Oh dear.  How much did 
you say you were going to pay me, again?

"> Access to company ZipCar account"

No doubt because of another night working until 11 PM, methinks...?

Also, detailed enumeration of company paid holidays is really not 
necessary in an initial ad...it's not as though all the other companies 
don't have the same deal.

Eek.

Actually, I tend to agree with Kristina and her comments about the "happy 
and peppy and bursting with love" corp.

A zipcar account??  I already have one anyway.

Show me the money!

Yay for Kristina!

All - thanks for your consideration.  Anyone looking on LI or commuting to
NYC coming from Long Island looking to drop the commute, take a look.  We
are looking for a proficient PHP developer ideally with some framework
experience (CodeIgniter/KohannaPHP).

Considering the flak i've seen for people looking for full time developers,
i'll keep this short - if you're interested, click the link.  Thanks!

Thanks Hans, and all, for the feedback.  Judging from the recent comments, we will be leaving things as is.  There is really nothing wrong with the way things are - people just need to be responsible mailing list members, and keep good netiquette.

Just as with any active list, these are important things to remember.

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] PHP Programmer Needed for Ongoing Projects
Message-ID: <FC99A252-B6FC-46BD-B9C2-D619105FFABB@giganticinc.com>

Gigantic Inc., is a small multimedia design firm based in SoHo, that  
has an immediate need for a PHP/MySQL programmer to work various web  
projects. We currently have 4-5 projects on our plate that require a  
talented PHP programmer to build clean, user-friendly solutions that  
range e-commerce cart implementations to an online ordering system for  
a major reprographics company. Some of these projects will require  
building for scratch while others will be modifications of existing  
PHP programming.

We are looking for a freelancer for the next 6 months with the  
possibility of a lifetime of projects! We are amenable to off-site  
work but would prefer that you have regular meetings with us in our  
office or at least be available via iChat video conferencing. No  
offense, but we also need a good command of the English language as we  
may need you to explain things to clients.

Now here is the kicker - we got burned by a PHP programmer the last  
time we did this. His name was Tom Gillis and I am not afraid to let  
you know because if I ever see him again he will have a hard time  
looking me in the eye. But I can see from reading the threads on this  
list that there are honest and talented programmers out there that  
would like to work on projects with dedicated and knowledgeable  
people. So please, if you are a slacker and a thief, don't waste my  
time. But if you want to earn a decent wage for some mid-level to high- 
level programming needs let me know you are interested.

Responsibilities
Work with our designers and project manager to build back-end  
solutions to medium-sized database driven websites. In most cases,   
you will be working with sites that have already had the framework or  
templates built in HTML and CSS. We would like you to work with our  
design team to build out the back-end sections of the sites into  
finished products. These back-end solutions involve simple CMS  
functionality like creating dynamic pages and integrating FCKEditor or  
something similar. Also integrating phpBB Forum solutions or Blogging  
applications.

Requirements
- PHP, MySQL (AJAX would be nice, but not required)
- Integration of off-the-shelf e-commerce software or custom built  
solutions
- Clear understanding of HTML & XHTML and CSS
- Knowledge of FCKEditor and phpBB integration very, very helpful
- Flash, Actionscript and XML are a big plus but not necessary
- Illustrator and Photoshop
- Strong communication skills
- Healthy desire to work with knowledgeable and really cool people

Compensation (fee based or hourly)
Depending on the complexity and scope of work, but fees usually range  
from $3,000 - $8,000 for website projects such as these: http://www.manhattansc.org 
  or http://www.owlibrary.org - these have a simple CMS back-end with  
integration of FCKEditor. I know this is a big range, but each project  
has a budget that we have to work within.

An hourly wage will be in the $40 - 60 range. Just work quickly ;-)

We will always do the best we can to compensate you fairly for your  
work. Sorry no bennies.


To apply, send an email and resume to doug at giganticinc.com.

If you want to know more about Gigantic and our projects, send me an  
email.

Message-ID: <e454cc950808191824q354aeb17g35753cb06af2ab85@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a pretty good idea that's been brewing in my head for quite a
while. It's ambitious, audacious, and certainly a challenge, but at the same
time, it's so audacious that it deserves nothing less than a real try.

I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful realization
that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor job of
bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media industry
hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential to solve
many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and promising
original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to get their
lucky break. I think it's time to change that.

I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that this is
an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and therefore worth
trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, including
other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone they
know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because something
like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's entire
history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self sustainable and
unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire
industry.

It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose features can be
logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured
product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and could be up
and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source
resources was built and successfully tested). However I need someone who
will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new pieces of the
puzzle are being implemented and thought up.

I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with UGC and a
CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them for the
long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical team/partner(s) to
really make this idea and vision happen.

So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't think I'm a
nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your qualifications and
I'll let you know more of the details.

I recommend this article/post:

http://codeclimber.blogspot.com/2008/04/all-i-need-is-programmer.html

As a member of several NYC networking groups, I can promise you that
ideas (both good and bad) are a dime a dozen, it's all on the
execution.

Maybe you're not looking for freebies, but if you are I recommend
against it. You might have more luck finding a developer that will
lower their wages in exchange for equity, or if you're absolutely
desperate, outsource the work developing a prototype, sell your idea
to investors, and then hire programmers to execute.

Hope that helps,

- Brian D.

Great article.  Thanks!  

As far as equity goes, I have "equity" in a project which I did last 
winter.  Most of the time these people pay a few grand in cash, which 
for the hours worked ends up being like $10 an hour or less, 
and "equity", and then just expect the thing to sell itself after you 
build it.  If they don't have the cash to pay you to build it, you KNOW 
they don't have the cash to market it and make it profitable.  I think 
any competent engineer can calculate the value of 10% of ZERO...

NEVER AGAIN.  My landlord, and the grocery store, don't accept a 
promise of "equity" as payment.  I learned the hard way not to go this 
route.  Maybe 1 out of 1,000 projects might be worth doing on that 
basis....maybe.

Well said, "

Cash is king.

Exactly.  And what a lot of these supposed "business geniuses" don't 
realize is...there's a huge amount of noise out there in cyberspace, it 
takes a MASSIVE amount of time and capital to make people aware of your 
website/software/what have you...and then to get them to open their 
wallets.

Bottom line, if these "idea people" don't have the money to pay someone 
to BUILD it, they won't have the money to pay someone to SELL it, which 
from what I've heard can be even more expensive.

They'll get someone to sell it the same way they are trying to get someone to develop it -- offer them a piece of the pie.  Then you end up in a TV documentary about how someone promised 50% of his business to 5 different people.

Exactly.  And what a lot of these supposed "business geniuses" don't 
realize is...there's a huge amount of noise out there in cyberspace, it 
takes a MASSIVE amount of time and capital to make people aware of your 
website/software/what have you...and then to get them to open their 
wallets.

Bottom line, if these "idea people" don't have the money to pay someone 
to BUILD it, they won't have the money to pay someone to SELL it, which 
from what I've heard can be even more expensive.

I have a great big idea too, there are only 2 main competitors..  
downfall is i do not have the ability to fund the project even though  
i would do all the programming myself there is server admin, front end  
designer / js guys etc.

The only way I could get this off the ground would be to use a  
template (i refuse to) or get friends to join in the deal.

Trying to sell something to someone for 10% of ZERO is not going to  
work.

If this is truly "entirely feasible and self sustainable" then why isn't it being presented to a venture capitalist who will put up CASH MONEY to pay for development?

I used to work in the media industry and came to the painful realization that it's probably the only industry that does an incredibly poor job of bringing in new people and new ideas. At the same time the media industry hasn't changed much even as technology has given it the potential to solve many of these issues. The end result is more misses than hits, and promising original talent being burned out as they tire out from trying to get their lucky break. I think it's time to change that.

I've spoken to several tech and marketing execs who all agree that this is an idea that is entirely feasible and self sustainable, and therefore worth trying at the very least. I've spoken with others in the industry, including other artists and creatives, who all tell me that they and everyone they know would jump at the chance to partake in that concept because something like this has been sorely lacking in the industry for nearly it's entire history. So in the end, it could be at the very least a self sustainable and unique niche site, or be even more, and disrupt and shift the entire industry.

It's not a concept that can be deployed overnight, but whose features can be logically implemented over time to create an ever more full featured product. The first iteration of the concept would be simple and could be up and running fairly fast(in fact a simple prototype using open source resources was built and successfully tested). However I need someone who will be able to take it beyond that, and keep it going as new pieces of the puzzle are being implemented and thought up.


I'm going to need a good LAMP developer who knows how to work with UGC and a CMS, and wants to be part of building an idea that might carry them for the long haul. I'm really looking for my long term technical team/partner(s) to really make this idea and vision happen.


So if you went through the trouble of reading all that and don't think I'm a nut for daring to think big, shoot me an email with your qualifications and I'll let you know more of the details.

Hello,
we work with start-ups from different States from some years ago.
We invest our work for equity and small amount of money in 5 start-ups.
One of the best experience we had with Toby Murdock and Mike Lewis. They 
are  co-founders of www.qloud.com ( search for "MyMUSIC" plug-ins on 
different social networking sites) was done by us ( they and REEA.net 
team)for shares and small amount of money at the beginning.
They respect our low rate  and they respect the equity that my new media 
shop had. They were good and find angel investors and VC's after a lot 
of work . Not easy, but we fight together for this ideas even that we 
work at thousands miles distance.
 From some months ago  www.qloud.com is part of www.buzznet.com

We work for other start-up : www.cellit.com and related media services 
in special for radio station.
We work right now in other two. One of them found the big investor and 
after almost 10months of work and some equity we have the chance to 
develop it the business for next 2-3 years.

We believe in the dreams of our business partners and we try to share 
with them our experience and in almost all the situations we understood 
what we must do and how we can recover the investment.
 From my point of view is more important to be pro-active and to try to 
help the other and to learn how we can do good businesses .
Of course that we don't invest money in something that don't have a 
business plan and  a minimum market research, but all the time I will 
say : "I am interested and let's see if we can make profit and if is 
possible a big ones." :)
I think that big ideas, need big dreamers too .

Good luck to every entrepreneurs !

I have 2 great ideas too, one of them there's no competitor and the
other there are only one competitor, but it's years behind the new web
tendencies.

I have all expertise to build each project, BUT my main issue is time.
Currently I work 10h/day in my own company and the rest of my
available time I help in open source projects (read as Doctrine and
Symfony). My company job is a fulltime work on a "brilliant idea" of
someone else, that has enough money to build it.
So, we all have our "brilliant ideas", but most of us never can make
it happen. If you have budget to hire someone to build it for you,
great.... otherwise... define new metas and "create" time to build by
yourself...


Cheers,

Ooops let's see they're using the "reea.net team" who undoubtedly are 
Indians working for $7 an hour...right?

Hello Donna,
from my experience the VC's don't put money right now  in businesses 
which don't have a prototype which work and can show them that ideas 
that you present in power point or in a doc file can be implemented .
If you don't have an history and is your first start-up than VC's don't 
put money easy.
 From my experience the money you can obtain from angel investors 
easier, from private person, friends which know the entrepreneurs and 
which want to put some cash for equity.
Because of my agreement i can not give you an example of other start-up 
where we have some equity and which near my team, are another 20 friends 
of the cofounders which put some cash on it.

Right now we work with an entrepreneur which move from Washington DC to 
NYC from personal and business reason.
He is low on money and we analyze right now how we can eliminate the 
risk of "10% from nothing" .
The most important thing is that peoples have ideas, they know there job 
very well and work hard to make the ideas a succesful business.

Sorry for my english and I hope that you understood what I want to say !

I had a brilliant idea also and that was, as a self employed 
programmer, to build stuff for people with these "great ideas".

Now, thanks to all these people and their "great ideas" and "low 
budgets", I have some new great ideas.  Such as being able to go to the 
dentist when I need to go, being able to afford decent food, and being 
able to pay rent on time. 

Full Time Job....here I come!! Cash is king -- it's so true.  I'm done 
posting on this...but it sure did hit a nerve.

Wow you guys are tough.
MY dislike with VC's isn't even the VC's, but rather the chase to find a VC
- why?
A successful business is one that makes a profit.
Not one that makes a lot of noise.
Profitability and giving ownership to a VC seem to have little if anything
in common.
The biggest upside to a VC partnership is gaining advice and a strong
network - but even that can turn a "venture capital" relationship into
"vulture capital" if you are not careful.

Hello Kristina,
you are wrong:).

We are Romanians and we don't work with 7$/hour :).
We work from 0 USD/hour and up depends on the business type and we do 
pro bono work too , a lot of pro bono work.
I work with partners from a lot of countries and the best one are the 
partners from USA. Why ? Because they have great ideas and know how how 
to make it alive.
This know-how transfer to companies and peoples which work in that 
companies hlep us together to do better jobs.
We make profit together and all the times businesses was win-win, based 
on respect for the other work.
Because I own and manage a 90 peoples multimedia shop here in 
Transylvania land ( Dracula land too :) ) , i can say that I pay a lot 
of money for software  licences and other equipments sell by companies 
from USA which make profit and which sell the software here at almost 
30% higher prices sometimes than in US, so the profit goes to local 
community where the company is registered etc.
I am sure that you know that internet help a lot the globalization and I 
am sure that you know that ROmania is part or EU  and EU is a strategic 
partner for USA :).
Anyway, my wife just come back from a conference from Harvard and she 
learn a lot from your countries and she will transfer the know how to 
Romanians students in some ways and part of Romanian student emigrate in 
USA and create there value for US country and life is beautiful and 
short :).

have a great day !
Dan

Here's an idea, how about writing some code instead of responding to this ridiculous email chain and billing your clients for it.

I had a brilliant idea also and that was, as a self employed
programmer, to build stuff for people with these "great ideas".

Now, thanks to all these people and their "great ideas" and "low
budgets", I have some new great ideas.  Such as being able to go to the
dentist when I need to go, being able to afford decent food, and being
able to pay rent on time.

Full Time Job....here I come!! Cash is king -- it's so true.  I'm done
posting on this...but it sure did hit a nerve.

Message-ID: <1219245927.26501@coral.he.net>

Excuse me, I'm not billing my clients for posting these emails...and 
for you to suggest it in a public forum is slanderous and extremely 
improper.  Who are you, anyway??

Here's an idea, how about writing some code instead of responding to this ridiculous email chain and billing your clients for it.

I had a brilliant idea also and that was, as a self employed
programmer, to build stuff for people with these "great ideas".

Now, thanks to all these people and their "great ideas" and "low
budgets", I have some new great ideas.  Such as being able to go to the
dentist when I need to go, being able to afford decent food, and being
able to pay rent on time.

Full Time Job....here I come!! Cash is king -- it's so true.  I'm done
posting on this...but it sure did hit a nerve.

Krisitina, thanks to you, I may be out of a job soon -- your "brilliant idea" had me laughing out loud at my desk and my boss wanted to know what was so funny!

I have another great idea for you, Kristina. Why don't you start using 
an e-mail client that doesn't break any freaking thread you participate 
in? And maybe instead of boring us with your childish e-mails, you can 
start using google to find out what an ternary operator is before 
"building stuff for people with these great ideas or even better read 
about netiquette and you will see why it's polite to delete the 
irrelevant parts from the reply and why it sucks to top-post.


Thanks,

Message-ID: <A8FC43E208A0EC47A4A158EF319A772F2158C6@be33.exg3.exghost.com>

Hi,

ETL gig involving bulk-geocoding a table of Location names.  You'll need to be familiar with the Geonames service (and perhaps Yahoo/Google geocoding APIs) and have solid SQL skills.

You'll be given 3 MySQL tables:

1.) A "Locations" table containing 7400 international locations.  Each location row has a "parent id" defined, creating a hierarchical relationship between the various locations.  So, more precise names can be created by recursively concatenating the location names together.  For example:

-- World (id = 0, parent = null)
   -- United States  (id = 100, parent = 0)
      -- New York (id = 200, parent = 100)
          -- Montauk (id = 300, parent = 200)

2.) A table of US zip codes (will help to disambiguate some US locations).  
3.) A table of country codes (will help to break up the lookups into country chunks)

Your delivarable:
 
1.) A plan/approach to geocoding.  This will outline the steps you'll take before doing any work.
     For example, perhaps you'd want to join countries -> locations, pull geonames feeds for those countries, break down the lookups by country.  Also, what's your plan for disambuating the lookup results?  If you want to write a loop that hits geonames 7500 times with a raw location name, thank you in advance for not replying.  :)

2.) An updated Locations table containing 5 new fields:
     a.) lat coord
     b.) long coord
     c.) foreign key to the US zip code table (if applicable)
     d.) foreign key to the Country table
     e.) geonames ID
 
Cheers,
Matt

Subject: [nycphp-jobs] PHP developer/architect to build a black box
 regression test suite for a RESTful interface
Message-ID: <C4DB8E47.B128%bokelley@appnexus.com>

AppNexus is developing a RESTful API to control a software service. The product is evolving quickly, and to ensure that the documentation and implementation are in sync, we need a black box regression test suite that implements what is _documented_, not necessarily what the system actually does.

We would like a senior developer who has experience working with APIs. One of the key results from this process should be ongoing feedback about the design of the system and the quality of the documentation. Fixing a design flaw is equally as valuable as finding a bug in the code.

Our team is experienced, so sloppy code will not be tolerated.

We have a sandbox environment ready for testing, with scripts that will build/update the system automatically. We use Subversion for version control.

Follow-on work is likely, and this project will continue as the system and specs evolve. AppNexus has raised more than $10MM in the past twelve months from top investors. We are also looking for senior development / engineering talent, so feel free to chat with us about that as well.

For more information, please contact me at bokelley at appnexus.com.
