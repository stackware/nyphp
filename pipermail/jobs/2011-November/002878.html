This job is on-site in NYC. We are located in midtown, and the company is LookBooks.com - a Software As A Service, Workflow Management company.

&#8226; Work with coders to provide high level estimates
&#8226; Keep coders firewalled
&#8226; Understand relative priorities of projects

&#8226; Scrum specific:
  -- Act as a scrum master
