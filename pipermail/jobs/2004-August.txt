Press Release

InterviewPro Enhances Advertisement Service 
 

Bronx, NY (July 22, 2004) ? InterviewPro, a leading provider of career information, announced today the enhancement of its advertisement service, in which employers can describe their products or services to prospective employees. 

The previous InterviewPro advertisement service led users to an advertiser?s website when the users clicked the advertisement message on InterviewPro?s website. With the previous service, advertisers had to maintain their own websites in order to display detailed information about their products or services.

With the enhanced advertisement service, advertisers can choose either to direct users to descriptions on their own websites or to descriptions on InterviewPro?s website. Thus, this extra benefit is available even to advertisers who do not have their own websites.

"We are very pleased to enhance our advertisement service while the overall economy is booming,? said Marianna Fu, RunningSoft Vice President of Services. ?Thousands of users have registered with InterviewPro. InterviewPro gets hundreds of hits from unregistered visitors every day. With our InterviewPro advertisement service, you may attract thousands of job seekers to your company."

Message-ID: <1093490781.3022.8.camel@coogle.localdomain>

Hey all!

I just wanted to take a moment to let you know my company Community
Connect, Inc. is looking for some solid PHP developers! If you consider
yourself a qualified PHP developer (being Zend Certified is a def. plus
to prove that) with MySQL and Oracle experience then I strongly
encourage you to drop me an e-mail with a copy of your resume! 

As for the company, we are a great 100 person firm responsible for the
biggest and best ethnic communities on the Internet such as
www.blackplanet.com. The culture is very laid back (as any good
development group should be) so don't worry about getting bogged down
with suits and such. Other than that, working for CCI is a great place
to teach, learn, and actually have a good time while making a very
respectable salary.

If you're interested, please feel free to email me
jcoggeshall at communityconnect.com with your resume.

Cheers!

John Coggeshall

Hello everyone,

I have an e-commerce Zen-Cart driven website with PHP/MySQL, and I need some customization.  If you have experience with this app, please contact me immediately for some work I need done.  Please only reply if you are familiar with the Zen-Cart system, as I can't afford to pay for time to learn Zen-Cart's in's and out's, though I know you all are brilliant and could pick it up in a few hours!
