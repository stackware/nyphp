* A high degree of comfort with Unix-like command lines and operating systems, including basic scripting is preferred.
* Experience with REST-based services and various feed formats is a plus.
* Strong quantitative and analytical skills with an interest in developing creative solutions that leverage disparate technologies with a focus on scalability and high availability.
* Strong communication skills, both verbal and written, with the ability to effectively participate in the product development and project management processes.
