<PRE>Kristina,

In their defense, this kind of agile, work hard, play hard environment is 
becoming much more common.  One of the largest start-ups I know gladly 
gives free alcohol to their employees, and yes, they drink during the day. 
But no is irresponsible, and it's been rated one of the top companies to 
work for.  Like Nik's company (I assume), they are looking for top talent 
and wouldn't hire people who are likely to abuse the system.  My guess is 
(though I don't know Nik) that his company also has an extremely relaxed 
vacation policy, because it isn't about the time you take, it's about the 
work you accomplish.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       ---
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Let's start with the boring stuff up front: We're a small,
</I>&gt;<i>       agile, well-trafficked startup in the sports analytics space.
</I>&gt;<i>       We've been covered by TechCrunch, we've been written up in
</I>&gt;<i>       Sports Illustrated, and now we're going to revolutionize the way
</I>&gt;<i>       users consume and engage with sports content. Our founders are
</I>&gt;<i>       ballers, our advisors are even more ballerous, and just wait
</I>&gt;<i>       until you see our product..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       If you're someone who loves sports and also loves building
</I>&gt;<i>       products, then we're your company. Even if you're not a huge
</I>&gt;<i>       sports fan, feel free to reach out to us - we're more interested
</I>&gt;<i>       in someone who knows how to get stuff done. If you're wondering
</I>&gt;<i>       what kind of people we're like socially, we have a kegerator in
</I>&gt;<i>       our office and our most played artist on iTunes is Animal
</I>&gt;<i>       Collective. You should be able to get our jokes and we should be
</I>&gt;<i>       able to want to hang out with you outside of work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Our stack is built on PHP and MySQL, but we're considering
</I>&gt;<i>       moving to Couch or Mongo. What do you suggest? We'd love to
</I>&gt;<i>       know. We have a world-class designer and front-end developer on
</I>&gt;<i>       board, we need to find someone who is comfortable on the PHP
</I>&gt;<i>       backend, taking things from the browser-level all the way down
</I>&gt;<i>       to the DB. We're not looking for someone who is merely good;
</I>&gt;<i>       we're looking for great - '85 Bears great. Lemieux in the 91-92
</I>&gt;<i>       playoffs great. Lemonade and BBQ on a Summer afternoon great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Skillsets:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        o  Excellent PHP skills (should be comfortable building out an
</I>&gt;<i>           application scalable to 100,000 daily uniques)
</I>&gt;<i>        o  Knowledgeable of system-wide architecture (setting up
</I>&gt;<i>           version control, release engineering structs, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>        o  Comfortable working in a fast-paced startup setting
</I>&gt;<i>        o  Familiarity with beer pong and general precepts of social
</I>&gt;<i>           skill
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Nice to have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        o  Familiarity with HTML/CSS/jQuery (not totally necessary as
</I>&gt;<i>           we already have a world-class designer and front-end)
</I>&gt;<i>        o  Sports fan (big, big plus - let us know what your favorite
</I>&gt;<i>           team is)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       What we're not:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        o  Some huge, boring company where you'll have meetings about
</I>&gt;<i>           meetings
</I>&gt;<i>        o  A company that works in a space that you could care less
</I>&gt;<i>           about
</I>&gt;<i>        o  A startup that values founder's valuations over the future
</I>&gt;<i>           gains of the employees
</I>&gt;<i>        o  A company founded by a bunch of suits who can't code Hello
</I>&gt;<i>           World in BASIC
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Even though we're a startup, this is a salary position. We'll
</I>&gt;<i>       shell out for the right employee. There is also a TON of equity
</I>&gt;<i>       involved; you're the third employee and huge part of our future
</I>&gt;<i>       success - we'll take care of you. You should ideally be in NYC,
</I>&gt;<i>       but that won't stop us from moving forward with the right
</I>&gt;<i>       person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       To apply, just send us a resume (please send <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">nik at numberfire.com</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>       and we'll go from there.
