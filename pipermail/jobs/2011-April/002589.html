<PRE>Startups thrive on employees that share a common ideal and culture. We're a
sports startup; we expect our employees to enjoy sports, enjoy hanging out
with each other, and enjoy the common experience of building a company from
a ground up. Therefore, we overwhelmingly prefer someone who will fit in
well with us. A good place to start from on that whole &quot;fitting in&quot; mantra
is not making outrageously incorrect generalizations.

It's not for everyone and it's apparently not for you. Thank you for your
concern.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's start with the boring stuff up front: We're a small, agile,
</I>&gt;<i> well-trafficked startup in the sports analytics space. We've been covered by
</I>&gt;<i> TechCrunch, we've been written up in Sports Illustrated, and now we're going
</I>&gt;<i> to revolutionize the way users consume and engage with sports content. Our
</I>&gt;<i> founders are ballers, our advisors are even more ballerous, and just wait
</I>&gt;<i> until you see our product..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're someone who loves sports and also loves building products, then
</I>&gt;<i> we're your company. Even if you're not a huge sports fan, feel free to reach
</I>&gt;<i> out to us - we're more interested in someone who knows how to get stuff
</I>&gt;<i> done. If you're wondering what kind of people we're like socially, we have a
</I>&gt;<i> kegerator in our office and our most played artist on iTunes is Animal
</I>&gt;<i> Collective. You should be able to get our jokes and we should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> want to hang out with you outside of work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our stack is built on PHP and MySQL, but we're considering moving to Couch
</I>&gt;<i> or Mongo. What do you suggest? We'd love to know. We have a world-class
</I>&gt;<i> designer and front-end developer on board, we need to find someone who is
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable on the PHP backend, taking things from the browser-level all the
</I>&gt;<i> way down to the DB. We're not looking for someone who is merely good; we're
</I>&gt;<i> looking for *great* - '85 Bears great. Lemieux in the 91-92 playoffs
</I>&gt;<i> great. Lemonade and BBQ on a Summer afternoon great.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Skillsets:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Excellent PHP skills (should be comfortable building out an
</I>&gt;<i>    application scalable to 100,000 daily uniques)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Knowledgeable of system-wide architecture (setting up version
</I>&gt;<i>    control, release engineering structs, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Comfortable working in a fast-paced startup setting
</I>&gt;<i>    - Familiarity with beer pong and general precepts of social skill
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Nice to have:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Familiarity with HTML/CSS/jQuery (not totally necessary as we already
</I>&gt;<i>    have a world-class designer and front-end)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Sports fan (big, big plus - let us know what your favorite team is)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What we're not:
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Some huge, boring company where you'll have meetings about meetings
</I>&gt;<i>    - A company that works in a space that you could care less about
</I>&gt;<i>    - A startup that values founder's valuations over the future gains of
</I>&gt;<i>    the employees
</I>&gt;<i>    - A company founded by a bunch of suits who can't code Hello World in
</I>&gt;<i>    BASIC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Even though we're a startup, this is a salary position.* We'll shell out
</I>&gt;<i> for the right employee. There is also a *TON* of equity involved; you're
</I>&gt;<i> the third employee and huge part of our future success - we'll take care of
</I>&gt;<i> you. You should ideally be in NYC, but that won't stop us from moving
</I>&gt;<i> forward with the right person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To apply, just send us a resume (please send <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">nik at numberfire.com</A>) and we'll
</I>&gt;<i> go from there.
