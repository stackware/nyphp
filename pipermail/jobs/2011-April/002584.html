<PRE>I'm not a recruiter. Recruiters are lame and have no idea what they're
doing. I know exactly what I'm looking for, so I'm posting here.

---

Let's start with the boring stuff up front: We're a small, agile,
well-trafficked startup in the sports analytics space. We've been covered by
TechCrunch, we've been written up in Sports Illustrated, and now we're going
to revolutionize the way users consume and engage with sports content. Our
founders are ballers, our advisors are even more ballerous, and just wait
until you see our product..

If you're someone who loves sports and also loves building products, then
we're your company. Even if you're not a huge sports fan, feel free to reach
out to us - we're more interested in someone who knows how to get stuff
done. If you're wondering what kind of people we're like socially, we have a
kegerator in our office and our most played artist on iTunes is Animal
Collective. You should be able to get our jokes and we should be able to
want to hang out with you outside of work.

Our stack is built on PHP and MySQL, but we're considering moving to Couch
or Mongo. What do you suggest? We'd love to know. We have a world-class
designer and front-end developer on board, we need to find someone who is
comfortable on the PHP backend, taking things from the browser-level all the
way down to the DB. We're not looking for someone who is merely good; we're
looking for *great* - '85 Bears great. Lemieux in the 91-92 playoffs great.
Lemonade and BBQ on a Summer afternoon great.
*
Skillsets:*

   - Excellent PHP skills (should be comfortable building out an application
   scalable to 100,000 daily uniques)
   - Knowledgeable of system-wide architecture (setting up version control,
   release engineering structs, etc.)
   - Comfortable working in a fast-paced startup setting
   - Familiarity with beer pong and general precepts of social skill



*Nice to have:*

   - Familiarity with HTML/CSS/jQuery (not totally necessary as we already
   have a world-class designer and front-end)
   - Sports fan (big, big plus - let us know what your favorite team is)



*What we're not:
*

   - Some huge, boring company where you'll have meetings about meetings
   - A company that works in a space that you could care less about
   - A startup that values founder's valuations over the future gains of the
   employees
   - A company founded by a bunch of suits who can't code Hello World in
   BASIC


*Even though we're a startup, this is a salary position.* We'll shell out
for the right employee. There is also a *TON* of equity involved; you're the
third employee and huge part of our future success - we'll take care of you.
You should ideally be in NYC, but that won't stop us from moving forward
with the right person.

To apply, just send us a resume (please send <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">nik at numberfire.com</A>) and we'll
go from there.
