<PRE>I do most of the web development and PHP stuff for this small company 
called Young Innovations, INC. (ydnt on the nyse) We are in the process 
of making a shopping cart for one of the small companies we own called 
plaksmacker. I have done all the work on this cart, it is the oscommerce 
cart that I'm sure lots of people are familiar with, but we have one 
problem with it:

it can only calculate shipping from one zip code location to another. 
Meaning that if we have 2 factories, which we do, the shopping cart will 
not know to calculate the shipping for the order based on which factory 
the customer is closest too.  OScommerce allows for shipping calculation 
from one location, a location that you setup early in the configuration 
part of the cart with a zip code. What we want the cart to be able to 
do, is to be able to determine the customers location from their signup, 
and assign them to a factory. When they place orders we would then like 
for the shipping module to calculate the shipping cost based on which 
factory they were assigned to, not just from the one location configured 
earlier in the cart.

There are some contributions that offer something simliar to this, but 
not exactly what we need, and I am unable to find any solution that I 
know of. So they told me to go out and try to find someone to come on 
part time to help us with this. This is why I'm posting here. If anybody 
thinks they know how to do it and would like to give me an estimate you 
can email me: <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs">ttoomey at ydnt.com</A> with a resume, or even better a timetable 
for how long this would take I'd appreciate it.

-Tim
