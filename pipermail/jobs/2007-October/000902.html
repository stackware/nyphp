<PRE>Hello,

Here is my job post that I would like to have on your website.  I wasn't
sure how to submit our job opening?

Thank You,

Melanie Martines

 

Join SellingSource.com, an industry leading developer of Technology Driven
Marketing Solutions, as a PHP Developer and become part of a dynamic and
fast growing team. 

Founded in 1997, SellingSource.com (www.SellingSource.com) develops
technology-driven marketing solutions for the online marketplace. Its
affiliated companies offer services such as enterprise software, campaign
management solutions, online advertising, text messaging, online data
verification, stored value financial products, software development and
video production services. The firm's unique approach to corporate
development ensures that each affiliate company remains focused on
developing, selling and supporting customer solutions, while
SellingSource.com provides consistent infrastructure, leadership and
financial stability to each company as it grows. SellingSource.com has
experienced extraordinary growth, with revenues increasing 1,493 percent
from 2003 to 2006. In 2006, the SellingSource.com was named the &quot;Number One
Technology Company in Las Vegas&quot; by the Las Vegas Business Press. In 2007,
the SellingSource.com ranked #109 on the 2007 ** Inc. magazine's prestigious
list of 500 fastest-growing privately held companies in America.

You will develop code for a variety of web applications, depending on the
current needs of our business. A strong understanding of overall PHP
programming techniques, including writing and interacting with objects, will
be critical as you work with other developers, project managers and the
software director to complete projects on a relatively short cycle time. You
will work with the project lead to determine priorities, and then work
autonomously to reach your goal. Comfort maneuvering in Unix is important,
as that is our platform of choice, and the ability to write and debug SQL
queries will also be helpful. 

Skills and Qualifications: 

.3-5 years experience

.Strong SQL and PHP skills

.Additional languages (C, C++, Perl, Python) beneficial

.Strong understanding of CVS and Subversion

.Must be able to write and debug advanced SQL queries

.Strong understanding of advanced Object Oriented Programming principles 

.Able to solve complex, multi-dimensional problems

.Can produce documentation of concept including flow charts and API
specifications

.Understanding of internet services such as SOAP, XMLRPC, WDDX, etc.

.Understanding of networking protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP

If you've always wanted to move to Las Vegas, this is your chance, as the
Selling Source will assist in the relocation of the top candidates.

Salary:  DOE
