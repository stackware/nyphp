 oriented site and mobile app
Message-ID: <C71CF3EC.4E494%emekapatrick@gmail.com>

Hi, I'm working on bringing an idea for a fashion oriented start-up to life
and given my advertising, marketing and strategy background I've been more
than able to put together a business and marketing plan, stages of
continuous innovation, and numerous revenue streams for this idea, all of
which have generated interest and even helped me get some experienced
informal advisers but....

I NEED A TECH LEAD.

All the people I know who know tech people are out on the West Coast and
I've had little to no luck finding someone out here. I want to find someone,
ideally a long-term partner, that can work with me on my idea and help take
it from my head and the paper into lovely code and make the site and mobile
app a reality. As far as compensation and financial reward, I am very open
and flexible to discussing whatever might make this work. I have friends and
family who are willing to invest in helping bring this life, and I also have
several friends in the VC world who would be willing to assist in taking
this to a bigger scale once we actually make this happen.

Anyhow, guess that's about it and really looking forward to hearing back.

Thanks,

Emeka

Message-ID: <F753621E-38C6-4EC0-8983-E1F67955873A@appnexus.com>

AppNexus is looking to expand our engineering team and if you are  
interested in joining us, we want to talk to you. Our team is made up  
of innovators and industry veterans building the next generation  
online advertising ecosystem. Our goal is to build a platform to make  
online display advertising more efficient, transparent, and effective.  
If we succeed in our mission, we will unlock millions - if not  
billions - of dollars of incremental revenue for publishers and  
advertisers, which will fuel the next phase of Internet innovation.

You will be working alongside experienced, Zend Certified Engineers  
that will help you grow as a developer just as much as we will learn  
from you.

Contact me if interested - I would love to hear from you!

Position Description

We are looking for a front end engineer with solid JavaScript, object- 
oriented PHP5, and MySQL experience to become a core member of a  
sharp, dynamic team. AppNexus clients trade on a steady stream of  
online media through our real-time transactional platform, a  
distributed system built on top of the AppNexus computing cloud that  
responds in a few milliseconds to billions of requests each day ?  
24/7, 365 days a year.

We need an efficient and agile engineer motivated by solving  
interesting technical challenges and building new applications  
quickly. Our team is rapidly developing new interfaces, functionality,  
and tools for our platform, and finding innovative ways to visualize  
lots of analytics data.

The position requires a problem solving mindset as much as it requires  
strong JS and PHP development skills. The ideal candidate is hands-on  
when designing applications and is comfortable coding off of a problem  
statement instead of a formal spec. Our environment is open,  
collaborative, and encourages learning. We release new code at least  
once a week (as continuous deployment actually increases reliability),  
so you must be both fast and accurate with your code and confident in  
your work. You?ll immediately see the results of your work and  
creativity ? as will the rest of our team, our clients, and the world  
at large.

Requirements

     * 2-5 years of production software development experience
     * Proficiency in Object Oriented PHP 5, experience with Zend  
framework preferred
     * Advanced JavaScript, AJAX, HTML and CSS usage a must,  
experience with jQuery preferred
     * Experience with both developing in a LAMP environment and basic  
LAMP system administration
     * Experience with server side application development and web  
services
     * Experience with a version control system and writing unit tests  
within a testing framework
     * Comfortable working in a fast-paced, 24/7 environment

This position is full-time in New York City (Union Square). This is  
not a telecommute or contract role. Unfortunately Relocation  
Assistance and Visa Sponsorships are not available at this time. No  
third-party subcontractors or agencies.

Dear list members, 

There's no actual PHP experience required for the Front-End Developer
position (below), but I'm hoping you'll let me slide on this one.  A lot of
similar skills that typically go with PHP are required and I'm hoping
someone might be interested. 

Thank you and happy holidays,

These 2 roles are full time, on-site, salaried positions located in New York
City paying $90,000-$120,000.  No telecommuting allowed.  US Citizens, Green
Card holders, EAD or CAN only please.  Local candidates strongly preferred. 

My NYC client is a media company that will focus on delivery of the
conversation versus the profile.  They call this Social 2.0.  The next
generation where users actually talk to each other in real-time or as close
to real-time as possible changing how people communicate.  Their systems are
designed to replace chat, social apps, SMS and MMS through full mobile
integration and web infusion. The company is privately funded and is in the
process of securing secondary funding which delivers 3 years of solvency.


[JOB #1] Senior Information Architect | 90-120k 

This role requires full process and documentation abilities as well as the
understanding of the UX.  We seek an out of the box thinker who has deep
vision for usability and understands how to get the job done. 

This role should be prepared to show previous work to substantiate
abilities.  We are looking for a leader who will bring in Junior candidates
who are young to develop a long term team for future development of our own
products. 

Preferred development understanding of Agile and SDLC from inception to
completion and then continued maintenance and versioning. Documentation
examples should include Use Case, Software specification, Wireframes,
Project flow or project management documentation. 

This position will be filled by a person who wants to build a team of
Architects to handle our multiple divisions and initiatives over the next 3
years.  This position reports direct to the Vice President of Brand and
Technology. 

 

[JOB #2] Senior Front-End Developer | 90-120k  

A rock star in front-end development focused not solely on the data but on
the understanding of how a user-interacts with the product from the UX
methodology. 

This developer will lead the charge of front end design with the VP of Brand
and Technology building standards and complete working prototypes for
delivery to third party developers in NYC.  Responsible for knowledge of
AJAX, JQuery, Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and XHTML. 

Must be able to present work samples and must be able to present themselves
as a self starter and out of the box thinker.  We are not looking to
replicate current system but develop for the future of the social and mobile
worlds. 



TO APPLY: The absolute best way to apply for one of these jobs would be to
not only submit your resume and/or portfolio or samples, but to elaborate on
how your experience relates to the job description along with your salary
requirements to beau-AT-open-source-staffing.com - These applications will
get noticed first.

holidays so your resume will not get lost in the shuffle.  Applying now as
opposed to later is better.
