<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>
   To provide a foundation of infrastructure, interaction and guidance upon which innovation
   can be based.
</p>


<h2>General Structure</h2>

<p>
   New York PHP takes a collaborative and consensus oriented approach using the following
   general structure:
</p>

<h3>Principal</h3>

<p>
   A Principal is any person demonstrating ongoing participation in New York PHP.  Principals
   are associated with Departments.
</p>

<h3>Department</h3>

<p>
   A Department is comprised of two or more Principals who work
   together and share related skills and interests to carry out Projects and other
   associated tasks.
</p>

<h3>Vice President</h3>

<p>The Principals of a Department elect from among themselves a
Vice President, whose duty it is to manage the Department, and represent it on
the Board of Directors.  A person can be the Vice President for only a single
Department.  Vice Presidents are responsible for the day-to-day affairs of
their Department, and for assuring that Projects overseen by their Departments
are completed in a timely and acceptable manner.  Vice Presidents may be
removed at the request of the Department's Principals and with the approval of
the Board of Directors.</p>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>A Project is a goal overseen by a Department and directly
managed by a Project Manager.  Projects can be either directly technical or
indirectly technical in nature.</p>

<h3>Project Manager</h3>

<p>Project Managers are drawn from the Principals of the
Department overseeing a Project.  It is their duty to organize the Project and
they are responsible for their Project's successful conclusion.  Project
Managers may be removed or reappointed by the overseeing Department.
A Vice President may be a Project Manager.  A Principal may be a Manager for
more than one Project.</p>

<h3>Board of Directors</h3>

<p>The Board of Directors is responsible for the management,
oversight and direction of New York PHP.  The Board is comprised of the Vice
President from each Department, plus the President.</p>

<h3>President/Chairman</h3>

<p>The President is the Chairman of the Board and is elected by
the Board of Directors.  It is the President's duty to ensure that New York PHP
develops in a manner consistent with its Mission, the goals set by the Board of
Directors, and the goals of its Principals and Departments.</p>

<h3>Associate</h3>

<p>An Associate is any person subscribing to and participating
in New York PHP's public mailing lists but not otherwise participating on an
ongoing basis in New York PHP activities.  An Associate, after demonstrating
ongoing participation, may become a Principal upon application to a Department's
Vice President, who has sole discretion to approve or reject the application.</p>


<h2>Protocol and Procedure</h2>

<p>Effective methods of communication and consistent processes
within New York PHP affect all operations.  All operations without more
specific terms should adhere to the Protocols and Procedures described here.</p>

<p>New York PHP implements <em>silence is acceptance</em> as a
general protocol.</p>

<p>
The President is authorized to have and use without prior approval an
automatically renewed Petty Cash account of $150.
</p>


<h3>Elections</h3>

<p>No elections shall take place during an initial
organizational period from 1 March 2004 to 28 February 2005.  Thereafter,
elections shall take place annually on or about 1 March.  At the first election
on or about 1 March 2005, Vice Presidents shall be elected for one-year terms,
but thereafter for two-year terms.  The President shall be elected for a
two-year term.  The two-year terms for Vice Presidents of Departments created
after the initial organizational period shall be coterminous with that of the President.</p>

<p>Elections for Vice President shall take place by email.  All
Principals of a Department are eligible to vote.  The person receiving the
majority of votes cast shall be elected.</p>

<h3>Mailing List</h3>

<p>Central to New York PHP communication is the use of mailing
lists.  Departments and the Board of Directors each have a mailing list. 
Mailing lists are the place for general and informal discussion.  They are also
the place for formal actions and proposals.  In these cases, these Protocols
and Procedures should be followed.</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Planned Action</strong>: Planned Actions are preliminary <em>unofficial</em>
     attempts to garner feedback for a potential course of action.  Any
     Principal or member of the general public may propose a Planned Action by
     sending it to the appropriate mailing list.  Planned Actions need to
     clearly indicate intention, timeframe and scope.  If there is no response
     from the mailing list within 48 hours the Planned Action is approved.  <em>It
     is now the responsibility of the submitter to follow through with the
     Planned Action and take it to completion</em>.  This may include writing a
     formal Project Proposal, research, or contacting involved parties.  The
     submitter is expected to keep the mailing list updated with progress until
     a conclusion or determining next step is reached.</li>
     <li><strong>Project</strong>:  Projects are <em>official</em> long term
     and intensive goals.  See section <strong>Projects</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Principals involved in a Planned Action are encouraged to
keep the appropriate mailing list(s) carbon-copied when communicating with an
external entity.  In the case of a Principal acting on behalf of a specific
Department, the Department's mailing list is appropriate.  In the case of a
Principal acting on behalf of New York PHP in general, the New York PHP
Development mailing list is appropriate.</p>

<p>Principals are subscribed to New York PHP's internal mailing lists.  If the
Board decides upon review that a Principal's project has stalled, or that the
Principal's participation has lacked, that Principal will be unsubscribed from all
internal mailing lists.</p>


<h3>Appropriate Use of Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>The mailing lists of New York PHP may not be used to:
</p>

<ol>
<li>promote any
commercial activities unless that posting has received prior board
approval, in which case the posting shall include the words "This
posting has been approved by the Board of New York PHP"; </li>

<li>suggest
that any activity, code base, or writing has been endorsed by or
created by or supported by New York PHP if that is not the case.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Board of New York PHP shall determine whether a violation of
appropriate use has occurred, and if it has, the President shall issue
a warning notice in writing to the violator.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who again violates appropriate use after having been already 
issued a warning notice shall be excluded from any and
all participation in New York PHP.</p>



<h3>Board of Directors</h3>

<p>The Board of Directors acts on matters brought to it for
review and of its own initiation.  Unless otherwise determined, all matters
brought to vote are considered approved if a majority is in favor.  Each
Department's Vice-President holds one vote.  The President holds one vote and
has no veto power.</p>

<h2>Departments</h2>

<p>Departments are the main organizational unit of New York
PHP.  Each Department's Principals share a common set of interests, skills, and
talents.  It is the objective and responsibility of the Department to carry out
its own Projects, and to provide resources for other Departments, Projects, and
Principals.</p>

<p>Departments can be added or removed with the approval of the
Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Responsibilities of each Department are outlined below.  These
responsibilities are in addition to those required by any Projects overseen by
the Department.</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>Operations</strong>
     <!-- nest ol must be within an li tag for validation -->
 <ol>
  <li>proactively forming relationships and partnerships with
      outside groups, vendors, and speakers</li>
  <li>proactively planning and organizing meetings and events</li>

      Departments and Projects</li>
  <li>providing general oversight and management of all
      technical areas</li>
 </ol></li>
</ol>


<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Projects are the heart of New York PHP's activities, and may
develop independently or in conjunction with one another.  Projects must have a
sponsoring Department and a Project Manager.  New York PHP supports many facets
of Project development through technical know-how, infrastructure,
organization, and exposure.  New York PHP adopts Projects that are both
explicitly technical and implicitly technical.</p>

<p>All Departments are expected to provide resources to all
Projects, even those sponsored by other Departments.</p>

<h3>Project Statuses</h3>

<p>The Board of Directors has the sole authority to approve
changes in Project status, and may change a Project status at any time. 
Projects may be in only one of the following statuses:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>approved</strong>:  After successfully completing the New
     Projects process, the Project is <em>approved</em>.  <em>Approved</em>
     projects are designated as such by the Board of Directors.</li>
 <li><strong>active</strong>: Active development and progress, as
     determined by the Project Manager and overseeing Department, continues.  <em>Active</em>
     projects have priority access to New York PHP resources and attention.  Only
     <em>approved</em> projects may become <em>active</em>.</li>
 <li><strong>postponed</strong>: The Project is not <em>active</em> but may
     become so at a later time.  <em>Postponed</em> Projects are kept for
     possible future attention, and may be resubmitted or reviewed at any time
     by a Project Manager or the Board of Directors.  <em>Postponed</em> projects
     have no access to New York PHP resources.</li>
 <li><strong>rejected</strong>: The Project has been determined to be
     inappropriate or has repeatedly violated Active Project Requirements.  <em>Rejected</em>
     projects will not be accepted for further review or consideration unless
     exceptions apply as determined by the Board of Directors.</li>
 <li><strong>completed</strong>:  The Project has met its goals.  No further 
     development or progress is required or expected, and the Project has no
     further access to New York PHP resources.  <em>Completed</em> Projects may
     become <em>active</em> again if future circumstances warrant, upon application
     to the Board of Directors from the Project Manager.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Active Project Requirements</h3>

<p><em>Active</em> Projects are subject to review by the Board of
Directors at any time.  To remain an <em>active</em> and supported New York PHP
Project, a Project Manager must ensure that they fulfill the following ongoing
requirements:</p>

<ul>
 <li>maintaining an accurate Project description</li>
 <li>maintaining at least monthly status reports or news items</li>
 <li>maintaining an accurate Project plan or <em>TODO</em>
     document </li>
 <li>for a technical Project, writing and maintaining
     documentation, including how to install and use the software</li>
 <li>announcing milestones at least every 6 months, and doing a
     reasonable job of reaching those milestones</li>
 <li>providing information on how others can join or help the
     Project</li>
</ul>

<p>Project Managers may request, through their overseeing
Departments, resources and support from any New York PHP Department, or other <em>active</em>
Project.</p>

<h3>Failed Projects</h3>

<p>Projects that are determined to have failed, or remain
inactive for an extended period of time, have their status changed to either <em>postponed</em>
or <em>rejected</em>.  Project Managers or Vice Presidents may consider a project
to have failed under any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
 <li>repeated failure to reach documented milestones</li>
 <li>no development for more than 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>The Board of Directors determines if the Project meets any
of these circumstances and will decide the status of the Project.</p>

<h3>New Project Proposal Submission and Review Process</h3>

<p>
A Project Proposal Form is submitted to the New Project Coordinator,
who reviews it for completeness and merit, and creates a node for it under the
Proposals node.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the Form is incomplete, the New Project Coordinator contacts the
  submitter for more information, and so updates the Project&#8217;s Proposal node.</li>

  <li>
  If the proposed Project is judged unworthy, the New Project
  Coordinator so notifies the submitter, and so updates the Project&#8217;s
  Proposal node.</li>

  <li>
  If the Project Proposal Form is complete and the Project is judged
  worthy, the New Project Coordinator submits it to the Board for approval,
  proposing in which Department the Project might be housed, and so
  notifies the submitter.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The Board reviews the proposed Project, voting to approve, reject, or
postpone it.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  If the proposed Project is approved by the Board and accepted by a Department, the
  Departmental Vice President assigns a Project Manager and creates a node
  for it under the Department node.  The New Project Coordinator so updates
  the Project&#8217;s Proposal node.</li>

  <li>
  If the proposed Project is rejected, the New Project Coordinator so
  notifies the submitter and so updates the Project&#8217;s Proposal node.</li>

  <li>
  If the proposed Project is postponed, a review date is set, and the
  New Project Coordinator so notifies the submitter, so updates the
  Project&#8217;s Proposal node, and remains responsible for instituting
  a review on or before the review date.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Project - Department Relationship</h3>

<p>Approved Projects are under the auspices of an overseeing Department,
which is usually the sponsoring Department.  At any time, and by recommendation
by the Board of Directors, overseeing Department, or Project Manager, a Project
may change its overseeing Department.  Any change in overseeing Departments
must be approved by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Project Managers must maintain status reports and
communicate with their overseeing Department on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>Internal Project Organization</h3>

<p>Internal Project organization and structure is at the sole
discretion of the Project Manager.  Project Managers are free to recruit
personnel or resources as they see fit, and organize themselves in any manner
necessary.</p>

<p>Interaction and recruitment between <em>active</em> New York
PHP Projects is subject to the review of overseeing Departments and the Board
of Directors.</p>


<h2>Charter Modification</h2>

<p>Any member of The Board of Directors may initiate a modification of this
Charter by submitting it via email to the Board, with the words "PROPOSED CHARTER REVISION:  48 HOUR
RULE" in the subject line. Other members of the Board of Directors will have 48 hours to respond
with an opinion on the proposal. No response shall be interpreted as
approval.
</p>


<h2>Website Maintenance</h2>

<p>All changes to the website must be approved by the Board of
Directors.  Such approval may be retroactive.</p>
